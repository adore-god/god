<h1>The Bible's Core Message Summed Up: Shift Your State, Change Your World</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<blockquote>The Bible is a book of psychological symbolism, revealing that God is found in imagination. It teaches the reader to assume the state they desire to live in—symbolised by figures like Abel, Joseph, and David—while abandoning the old state of being, represented by Cain and Saul. Through sustained imagination, the desired state is brought into manifestation, embodied by Jesus.</blockquote><p>The Bible isn’t a historical record or a moral rulebook, it's a profound guide to inner transformation.</p><p>When read symbolically, the Bible reveals itself as a psychological map, instructing the reader in how to shift states of being. It teaches that God is not found in a distant heaven but in the human imagination—the creative power within. This inner God is the source of all that is seen, experienced, and expressed.</p><h3><strong>God is Imagination</strong></h3><p>Neville Goddard taught that the name of God—<em><b>I AM</b></em>—<i>(Ex 3:14)</i> is the awareness of being itself. Imagination, then, is not some fanciful indulgence, but the divine creative force. “Man is all imagination,” he wrote, “and God is man, and exists in us and we in Him.” The Bible affirms this not by stating it directly, but through symbolic narrative.</p><p>From Genesis to Revelation, the characters are not people but <em>states of consciousness</em>—conditions of the mind and heart.</p><h3><strong>Choose the State You Do Want</strong></h3><p>The Bible presents two paths over and over: the chosen and the cast out, the inner and the outer, the new and the old. These are not stories of rivalry between brothers or kings, but parables about identity.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cain and Abel</strong> show this clearly. Cain, the man of effort and appearances, slays Abel, the inner prototype—the imagined ideal. But the inner man always returns, reborn in another form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Joseph</strong>, dismissed and enslaved by his own brothers, lives faithfully to the dreams he has imagined. His imagination leads him from prison to power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong>, the overlooked shepherd, is anointed as king while Saul, the outer man, still sits on the throne. It is not the visible man, but the <em>assumed state</em>—the faith-filled, imaginative one—that is truly chosen.</p>
</li>
</ul><div><blockquote>"<i>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</i>" - Mark 11:24</blockquote></div><h3><strong>Ditch the Old State</strong></h3><p>Every major biblical conflict is really a contest between the <em>old self</em> and the <em>new inner identity</em>. Saul seeks to kill David. The Pharisees reject Jesus. Egypt holds Israel in bondage. All of these outer conditions must fall away when the inner reality becomes real to the individual.</p><p>This is not about fighting the world. It is about refusing to identify with a state of being that no longer serves.</p><h3><strong>Imagine It Until It Manifests</strong></h3><p>Jesus, in this framework, is not a man in the physical sense, but the image and formation of fulfilled desire. He is the Word (thought, assumption, imagination) made flesh. He embodies the state that was once invisible and now lives in the world. The crucifixion is not tragedy—it is the <em>fixing</em> of a state in imagination. Resurrection is the emergence of that assumption into visibility.</p><p>You don’t wait to become it. You <em>assume</em> it now. You live from the end. You imagine the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Inner Journey of the Bible</strong></h3><p>When read symbolically, the Bible becomes a handbook for spiritual awakening—not to an external God, but to the power of awareness itself.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>You assume the state you <em>do</em> want to live in (Abel, Joseph, David).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You abandon the state you no longer want to live in (Cain, Saul).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You sustain the inner vision until it manifests (Jesus).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>God lies in imagination. The Bible invites the reader to awaken to this truth—not just to understand it, but to live it.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-guides.html" class="noTag">Guides</a></p>
