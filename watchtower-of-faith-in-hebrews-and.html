<h1>Watchtower of Faith in Hebrews and Habakkuk</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>When read symbolically rather than literally, the Bible reveals a profound inner drama — not of ancient prophets awaiting external events, but of the individual soul <b>learning to wait in faith for the manifestation of what has been assumed.</b> Hebrews 10:35–39 echoes this timeless truth, and it mirrors an earlier moment in Scripture: the prophet <a href="habakkuk-11-4-frustration-of-waiting.html">Habakkuk standing on his watchtower</a>, determined to see the vision fulfilled.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Watchtower: Inner Vigilance in the Silence Between Desire and Fulfilment</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will take my stand at my watchpost and station myself on the tower, and look out to see what he will say to me...”<br>
— <em>Habakkuk 2:1 (ESV)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Habakkuk represents a state of consciousness that <b><a href="genesis-224-love.html">refuses to let go of its desire</a></b>. He stations himself upon his watchtower — an elevated place of awareness — to see the response from within. This watchtower is not physical, but symbolic: it is the <b>still, alert posture of mind that refuses to abandon its assumption —</b><i> "Be still and know that <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> God".- Psalm 46:10</i></p>
<p>Similarly, Hebrews 10:36–37 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have need of waiting before his word has effect for you. In a very little time he who is coming will come; he will not be slow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the “coming” one is not a messianic figure travelling through space, but the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">embodiment of the assumption</a> — the imaginal act that is taking shape below the surface of life.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Vision Will Not Lie: Trust in the Timelessness of Desire</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“The vision is yet for an appointed time; it hastens to the end—it will not lie. If it seems slow, wait for it; it will surely come; it will not delay.”<br>
— <em>Habakkuk 2:3</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hebrews picks up this very thread: <em>“He who is coming will come; he will not be slow.”</em> The echo is intentional, but spiritually, it is about the same principle: <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">the Law of Assumption</a>. Neville Goddard taught that once an <a href="scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html" class="noTag">assumption is fixed in consciousness</a>, its arrival is inevitable — just as the vision “hastens to the end.”</p>
<p>Delay is a temptation to doubt. But “waiting” here does not mean passive hoping. It means continuing in faith, unmoved, keeping the assumption alive — as Habakkuk does on his watchtower and as the writer of Hebrews urges his audience to do.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Just Shall Live by Faith: The Bridge Between the Two Passages</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“But the upright man will be living by his faith...” — <em>Hebrews 10:38</em> </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>
“...but the righteous shall live by his faith.” — <em>Habakkuk 2:4</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the very verse from Habakkuk that Hebrews is quoting. But when we interpret faith as Neville did — not mere belief in dogma, but the <em>loyalty to the unseen reality assumed in imagination</em> — it transforms the statement. The “upright man” or “righteous” one is the individual who stays loyal to the vision, even when it appears nothing is happening.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Not of Those Who Shrink Back: The Danger of Doubt</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“But if he goes back, my soul will have <b><a href="genesis-47-sin.html">no pleasure in</a></b> him.”<br>
“But we are not of those who go back to destruction; but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul.” — <em>Hebrews 10:38–39</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase “my soul will have no <b>pleasure</b> in him” (Hebrews 10:38) reveals that the assumption — once withdrawn from — no longer delights in its creative purpose. This echoes Genesis 4:7, where God says to Cain, “If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if not, sin is waiting at the door.” <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Sin, in this symbolic reading, is not wrongdoing</a>, but the missed mark — the loss of <b><a href="eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">pleasure</a></b> in creation through doubt and regression.</p><p>The warning is clear: turning back is destruction, not by external punishment, but by the collapse of the assumption. To go back is to fall into the old state — the Egypt of doubt, the bondage of fear. This matches the warning <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> gave Habakkuk: the vision is trustworthy — but <em>you</em> must wait for it. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Conclusion: The Inner Path of the Watcher</h3>
<p>In both Habakkuk and Hebrews, the call is the same: to fix the vision, to believe unwaveringly in what has been inwardly accepted as true, and to<a href="genesis-126-man.html"> “watch” — not in idleness, but in active imaginative </a>and spiritual anticipation. Neville would say this is the art of living in the end, embodying the state of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<p>The watchtower is the place within you that does not waver, does not compromise, and does not turn back.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
