<h1>The Fall of Assumed Kings: What Allegations in Hollywood Reveal About Power, Imagination, and the Bible According to Neville Goddard</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p><strong>Neville Goddard didn’t teach New Age fluff. He taught the Bible.</strong></p><p>
He simply took it out of the dusty pews and placed it where it belongs: in the mind, the imagination, and the unfolding of life itself. Every parable, every figure, every action—symbolic. And when interpreted correctly, it reveals the law by which everything in your world is made: assumption.</p>
<p>Right now, the public eye is ablaze with the collapse of figures once considered untouchable. Sean “P. Diddy” Combs, Russell Brand, Prince Andrew—and now Gerard Depardieu—are all, to varying degrees and in different legal contexts, under scrutiny for alleged acts of abuse and misconduct—particularly toward women. And while the judicial systems must do what they do, let’s look through a different structure: the symbolic map of the Bible as explained by Goddard, and the law that underpins all creation.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>The Law of Assumption: Your Inner King</strong></h2>
<p>Neville taught that your inner world creates your outer world. What you assume to be true of yourself and others—whether whispered quietly in thought or wrapped in a flashy persona—will solidify into your life experience. The Bible’s kings symbolise these ruling assumptions. When a “king” within believes he has authority over others without honour, without humility, or without accountability, collapse is inevitable.</p>
<p>This isn't karma—it’s creation. The same law that creates success will also bring about ruin when powered by corrupt inner images.</p>
<p>P. Diddy, for example, is facing allegations that span decades of coercion and abuse. The outer spectacle may shock some, but from the Law of Assumption’s point of view, it is a reflection of a long-held inner belief in personal supremacy. A kind of Pharaoh consciousness. The assumption that others exist to serve your world—rather than being sacred reflections of it—can only end in destruction. Not as divine punishment, but as the natural outcome of that seed.</p>
<p>And Gerard Depardieu—convicted, now, of sexual assault—represents yet another visible toppling of an “inner king” who once seemed culturally immortal. Not because of some divine vendetta, but because no structure built on forced assumption over the feminine—literal or symbolic—can stand.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>The Woman as Subconscious: Violated Creative Law</strong></h2>
<p>Neville explained that women in the Bible symbolise the subconscious mind, the creative power of the world. She accepts what is impressed upon her and brings it into form—whether life-giving or destructive.</p>
<p>So what happens when men in power assume dominion over “women” (read: the subconscious) not with love or truth, but with force and control?</p>
<p>Exactly what we’re witnessing.</p>
<p>Amnon and Tamar provide the biblical pattern: Amnon believed he had the right to take what he desired. That assumption grew. He manipulated, violated, and lost everything. His “house” (his inner world) collapsed. He died not because God was angry, but because the creative law cannot be mocked. When the conscious mind tries to force its will on the subconscious without honour, the result is disorder.</p>
<p>So too in these modern cases: the subconscious receives the assumption, incubates it, and returns the result—public collapse, broken reputations, and the rot surfacing.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Russell Brand and the Literal Jesus Problem</strong></h2>
<p>And then there’s Russell Brand. Known for his flamboyant blend of spirituality, scandal, and self-promotion, Brand now seems to have adopted a literal understanding of Jesus—as if quoting the Gospels with a dramatic pause will absolve decades of alleged misconduct.</p>
<p>It's almost tragic-comic: after dancing with every mystical system under the sun, he's now clutching a Bible as if it were a shield from consequences. But Neville would call this what it is: missing the point. The Bible isn’t literal history—it’s a psychological blueprint. Jesus is not a man you find in a church; he’s the awakened imagination within you. The one who realises, “I and my Father are one”—my assumptions and my world are the same thing.</p>
<p>Quoting Jesus while refusing to look at the assumptions that shaped your world is like polishing the chalice while ignoring the poison inside it.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>This Is Bible Teaching—Not Just Philosophy</strong></h2>
<p>Neville wasn’t inventing a new religion. He was restoring the Bible to its rightful place as a manual for imaginative life. Every story, every character, every tragedy is about the states you move through. Pharaoh, Saul, Nebuchadnezzar, Amnon—they all represent inner dominions, inner assumptions, and their inevitable end when built on pride and domination.</p>
<p>What we’re seeing in Hollywood is not merely legal fallout—it is the outpicturing of a rotten inner kingdom. The assumption that fame, charisma, or royal lineage places you above accountability is itself a spiritual delusion. And the Bible has been exposing that lie for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The fall of these figures is a message to all of us: if your assumptions do not honour others, your world will eventually dishonour you. If your inner king violates the sacred feminine (subconscious), your outer kingdom will not last.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Time for New Assumptions</strong></h2>
<p>What Neville offered was not condemnation, but clarity. If you want to live differently, assume differently. Assume worthiness. Assume honour. Assume that others are not tools, but reflections of your inner world. Build your kingdom on that, and it will stand.</p>
<p>As for those collapsing? Their fall is not the end. It’s the end of a lie. And that, painful though it may be, is a mercy. Because only when the lie crumbles can the truth begin.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Author’s Note</strong></h2>
<p>This article is not intended as a legal or moral judgement of any individual. The allegations and convictions mentioned vary by legal system and status. My intention is to explore public narratives through the spiritual and symbolic framework taught by Neville Goddard, which is itself derived from the Bible. In his teachings, life events mirror inner assumptions—unconscious beliefs that shape our external reality.</p>
<p>This isn’t about gossip or blame. It’s about recognising patterns, symbols, and consequences within ourselves and the world, so we can choose better, higher assumptions—and create from truth rather than ego.</p>
<p>If we can read the Bible symbolically, as Neville did, we’ll see not only why certain downfalls occur, but also how redemption always begins within.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
