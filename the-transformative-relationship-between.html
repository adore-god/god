<h1>Mary Magdalene: At the Crucifixion and Resurrection</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>

<p>In the Gospel of John, the symbolic relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene (derived from <a href="from-rebellion-to-redemption-miriam-and.html">Miriam</a>) reveals a foundational principle of creation. Read through Neville Goddard’s understanding, Jesus symbolises the conscious directive — the declaring “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” — while Mary Magdalene represents the responsive mind: the aspect of self that no longer argues, resists, or questions, but receives and holds what the “I AM” has claimed.</p>

<p>This is not a story of two people, but of one mind functioning in two modes: the one that declares and the one that listens.</p>

<p>This union echoes the mystery in Genesis 2:23, where <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a> is said to be “bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.” This is not describing hierarchy or physical origin, but a metaphysical law: manifestation (the “woman”) is drawn directly from belief held without contradiction. The outer condition is belief made visible.</p>

<p>“Bone of bones” signifies structure and certainty; “flesh of flesh” signifies embodiment. What the mind accepts as true without resistance becomes the very substance of experience.</p>

<h2>Mary Magdalene at the Cross</h2>

<p>At the foot of the cross, Mary Magdalene stands present and unmoved. She does not interfere or attempt to reason. She simply remains.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"These things did the armed men do. Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother’s sister Mary, the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."<br>
(John 19:25, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cross symbolises the fixing of an idea in <a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagination</a> — the point at which an assumption is no longer debated. Mary’s presence signifies the responsive mind’s role: it does not choose or direct, it consents.</p>

<p>As Eve is not brought forth until Adam enters deep sleep, manifestation does not occur until inner argument ceases. The responsive mind stands by while the old state dies.</p>

<h2>The Awakening at the Tomb</h2>

<p>Mary Magdalene’s visit to the tomb reflects the moment after an assumption has been fixed, when the old identity has collapsed but the new has not yet been recognised.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning, she said to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master)."<br>
(John 20:16, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This moment connects directly to the <a class="noTag" href="genesis-47-sin.html">principle first stated in Genesis 4:7</a>: “you must master it.” To master is not to control, but to rule through listening and obedience to the true <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM</a>.”</p>

<p>When Mary calls him “Master,” it is not reverence toward another, but recognition within herself. The responsive mind acknowledges the authority of the declaration it is now faithful to. The mind that once reacted is now mastered — disciplined enough to listen, receive, and respond truthfully.</p>

<p>As in Genesis, where <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">naming is a mental act</a>, this recognition signifies full identification with the new state. Argument ends. Identity is assumed.</p>

<h2>The Release and Ascension</h2>

<p>When Jesus instructs Mary not to cling to him, he reveals that once the responsive mind has accepted an assumption, it must not interfere with its unfolding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Jesus said to her, Do not put your hand on me, because I have not gone up to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, I go up to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God."<br>
(John 20:17, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This mirrors Adam’s deep sleep. Creation proceeds through rest, not vigilance. The responsive mind remains impressed, not occupied.</p>

<h2>The Inner Marriage</h2>

<p>What is revealed through Jesus and Mary Magdalene is the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">inner marriage between declaration and response</a>. Neville describes this as the sole creative act: the conscious mind declares, the responsive mind believes.</p>

<p><a class="noTag" href="genesis-223-woman.html">Genesis 2:23 teaches that manifestation is never foreign</a> — it is always “bone of my bones.” Whatever confronts us is belief externalised.</p>

<p>Mary Magdalene symbolises the mind that has been mastered — disciplined enough to listen, faithful enough to hold the “I AM” steady until it appears.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: The Creative Principle</h2>

<p>This story is instruction, not history. Creation begins when the conscious mind declares and the responsive mind consents.</p>

<p>Persistence is not effort, but refusal to argue. When the mind rests in “I AM,” resurrection is inevitable.</p>

<p>This is the mystery of creation: belief mastered, and therefore made flesh.</p>
