<h1>Proverbs 3: A Neville Goddard Interpretation</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><em>Divine Wisdom for Daily Manifestation</em></p>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Proverbs 3 is often read as a father’s advice to a son, but through the spiritual teachings of Neville Goddard, it unfolds as a conversation between the surface mind and the deeper self—the divine imagination. Each verse becomes a psychological instruction, not just for moral living, but for conscious creation. Below, we explore this chapter as a symbolic guide to aligning the heart with the law of assumption, the creative power of “I AM.”</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>1–2: Keep the Law in the Heart</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments...”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville saw “law” as the law of assumption: that what you feel as true inwardly will become outwardly real. Keeping it in the heart means impressing your desires upon the subconscious through feeling. This inward obedience brings peace and extension of life—not just in time, but in quality.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>3–4: Bind Mercy and Truth to Your Being</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let not mercy and truth forsake thee... write them upon the table of thine heart.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercy is the power to revise and forgive imaginatively; truth is inner alignment with your assumption. Wearing them around your neck symbolises constant expression. Writing them on your heart is the art of inward impression, which precedes all manifestation.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>5–6: Trust Imagination, Not Appearances</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To “trust in the Lord” is to trust your imagination. The outer world reflects past beliefs, not truth. Acknowledge imagination in all you do, and your path will be made clear—not by logic, but by inner certainty.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>7–8: Humility Before the Inner Creative Power</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Be not wise in thine own eyes... it shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t cling to intellectual pride or sensory evidence. Reverence the creative power within, and you’ll find renewal. Departing from ‘evil’ means withdrawing your energy from states of fear, doubt, and reactive thought.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>9–10: Give to the Invisible First</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Honour the Lord with thy substance... so shall thy barns be filled with plenty.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To give your best substance—your attention and emotion—to imagination is to plant seeds in fertile ground. Honour the invisible cause, and the visible effects will flourish.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>11–12: Correction Is Love</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Despise not the chastening of the Lord... for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When something unwanted appears, don’t react. Recognise it as a message from your own subconscious assumptions. Correction is not punishment; it is guidance, drawing you back to awareness of your creative power.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>13–18: The Priceless Value of Imaginative Wisdom</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Happy is the man that findeth wisdom... She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wisdom here is the understanding of how imagination creates reality. It is more precious than silver and gold because it precedes and produces them. Lay hold of this inner vision, and you live in perpetual fruitfulness.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>19–20: Creation Through Wisdom</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The outer world is the result of inner states. Wisdom—right use of imagination—is the source of creation. Nothing comes into being without first being conceived in consciousness.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>21–26: Inner Sight Brings Peace</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let not them depart from thine eyes... then shalt thou walk in thy way safely…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep your spiritual vision—your assumption—before your mind’s eye. Do not waver. This steadfast inner seeing brings security, ease, and peaceful rest, even when the world appears unstable.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>27–30: Imaginative Generosity</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Withhold not good from them to whom it is due…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagination is not only creative; it is relational. How you think of others is how you treat yourself. Bless them in imagination. Refuse to entertain thoughts of conflict, and you create a world that returns the same peace.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>31–35: Choose Your Inner Companions Wisely</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Envy thou not the oppressor... the wise shall inherit glory…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t covet or compare. The power is already within you. Those who manipulate the outer world without inner understanding may rise briefly, but only wisdom—imaginative insight—endures. Grace belongs to those who trust the unseen.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: Proverbs as Practical Power</strong></h2>
<p>Proverbs 3 is not moral instruction for behaviour, but metaphysical guidance for being. Every verse affirms Neville’s central idea: <strong>that imagination, rightly used, is the Lord—the true source of life, wisdom, and peace</strong>. To live by these truths is to walk in favour with both God (your own deeper self) and man (your reflected world).</p><div class="share-dropdown">
