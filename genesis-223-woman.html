<blockquote>
“This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” – Genesis 2:23
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">opening of Genesis is not a historical account—it is a symbolic teaching of consciousness</a>. Eve is <strong>drawn from Adam</strong>, symbolising that awareness is <strong>beginning to observe and reflect on itself</strong>. She is not a separate “person,” but the <strong>mind’s capacity to become conscious of its own being</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the <strong>emergence of self-reflective thought in response to identity (<a href="genesis-126-man.html">Man</a>)</strong>, the ability to recognise inner states, witness them, and interact with them. Eve embodies <strong>consciousness examining its own imagination</strong>.</p>

<h2>Bone of My Bones, Flesh of My Flesh</h2>

<p>When Adam declares, “Bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,” he is recognising that <strong>everything experienced outwardly originates from his own inner life</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The rib</strong> represents the <strong>heart of assumption</strong>—the source of attachment, love, and inner conviction.</li>
<li>Eve is drawn from this rib, symbolising that <strong>manifested life arises from what consciousness loves and dwells upon</strong>, whether that attachment is harmonious or misaligned.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, this illustrates a key principle: <strong>what the mind loves, it will manifest</strong>. Eve is therefore the <strong>first wife</strong>, reflecting what Adam (awareness) is attached to—the formative assumptions that shape all experience.</p>

<h2>The First Wife: Consciousness and Attachment</h2>

<blockquote>
“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.” – Genesis 2:24
</blockquote>

<p>Here, <a href="genesis-224-love.html">the “wife”</a> is <strong>the conscious reflection of what the mind esteems and attaches to</strong>. She emerges from Adam, the aware self, representing:</p>

<ul>
<li>The inner state that awareness loves and sustains.</li>
<li>The capacity to <strong>reflect on and engage with imagination</strong>.</li>
<li>The union between awareness and the formative assumption—the first step in conscious creation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every attachment, every preference, <a href="genesis-224-love.html">every love in consciousness</a> is <strong>Eve made visible</strong>. The first wife is the mind meeting its own inner assumption.</p>

<h2>Woman as the Mind Observing Itself</h2>

<p>Eve represents <strong>the mind turning inward and observing itself</strong>. She is the part of consciousness that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recognises the thoughts and feelings it has nurtured.</li>
<li>Mirrors the attachments, loves, and assumptions it carries.</li>
<li>Responds to awareness rather than operating blindly.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Neville Goddard’s framework:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Adam</strong> = pure conscious awareness, the “I AM” from which creation arises. <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">See more on I AM</a></li>
<li><strong>Eve</strong> = self-reflective consciousness, the formative power that observes, receives, and manifests the mind’s assumptions. <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">Seed of imagination</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Through Eve, we see that <strong>consciousness is never separate from what it loves</strong>. She is the witness, the mirror, and the formative reflection of inner reality.</p>

<h2>From Reflection to Manifestation</h2>

<p>The story of Eve illustrates how <strong>awareness interacting with what it loves gives rise to all outer experience</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>When imagination is aligned with desire and faith, Eve is receptive, responsive, and harmonious.</li>
<li>When assumptions are misaligned, fearful, or resistant, manifestations carry the weight of that inner tension. <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">See more on misaligned assumptions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>She is the <strong>first wife</strong> because she reflects the first attachment of awareness—whether good or bad—making visible the <strong>heart of consciousness</strong>.</p>

<h2>Final Reflection</h2>

<p>Genesis 2:23–24 is not about anatomy or gender—it is a <strong>lesson in consciousness and manifestation</strong>. Eve, drawn from Adam, is <strong>the conscious mind observing itself</strong>, the first “wife” representing <strong>what awareness loves and attaches to</strong>.</p>

<p>Every inner attachment and every assumption manifests outwardly. The law is simple: <strong>as within, so without</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
As Neville said: <em>“Change your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live.”</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Eve reminds us: the world you see is the mirror of <strong>what your awareness esteems and carries in its heart</strong>. The first wife, drawn from the rib of man, is consciousness becoming aware of itself—<strong>self-reflective imagination made visible</strong>. <a href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-23-series.html">See more on Genesis 2:23 series</a></p>
