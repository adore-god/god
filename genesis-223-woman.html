<h1>Genesis 2:23: WOMAN</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<img alt="Woman Icon The Way" src="images/wp/woman.webp"/><blockquote><em>&ldquo;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.&rdquo; &ndash; Genesis 2:23</em></blockquote><p></p>To the literalist, this verse describes the first <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-23-series.html">woman</a> being formed from a man's rib. But to the one who sees with the eyes of imagination, as <a href="only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard</a> teaches, this is an unveiling of spiritual law. The verse is <b>not about anatomy or gender</b>, but about <strong><a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> and manifestation</strong>, the inner and outer aspects of your own inventive power.<div><br/><div>The phrase &ldquo;she shall be <i><b>called Woman</b></i>&rdquo; here is more than a simple naming; it is a <b><i>calling forth</i></b>&mdash;a declaration of her essential function and destiny within consciousness. <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-23-series.html">Woman</a> is called to be the receptive power, the womb within the mind that gives form to the desires <a href="genesis-126-man.html">conceived by man</a>. She emerges not as a label but as a vital, active force of creation.
<blockquote>
And again he said, &ldquo;To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
<br/> It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.&rdquo; &mdash; Luke 13:20-21
</blockquote>
</div><div><br/></div><div>Just as God declares &ldquo;<b><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM THAT I AM</a></b>&rdquo; &mdash; Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh &mdash; in Exodus 3:14, meaning both &ldquo;I will be what I will be&rdquo; and &ldquo;I AM that I AM,&rdquo; we hear the same pattern echoed in Adam&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;<b><i>bone of my bones, and flesh of my fles</i>h</b>.&rdquo; This is not just about origin, but about identity and expression. <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">&ldquo;Woman&rdquo; is what consciousness has <i>called</i> forth from itself&mdash;the <b>visible emergence of an invisible assumption</b></a>, manifestation as self made flesh.<br/><p></p>
<h3><strong>Man as Awareness, Woman as Embodiment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. - Genesis 3:20
<br/> <br/> 
&ldquo;Fear not, for I have redeemed you;
I have called you by name, you are mine." &mdash; Isaiah 43:1</blockquote>
<p>In Neville&rsquo;s teaching, the <strong>&ldquo;<a href="genesis-126-man.html" target="_blank">man</a>&rdquo;</strong> symbolises your <strong>conscious awareness of being</strong>&mdash;that deep &ldquo;<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html" target="_blank">I AM</a>&rdquo; from which all creation proceeds. The <strong>&ldquo;woman,&rdquo;</strong> drawn from man, symbolises the <strong>outer world</strong>, or any <strong>manifested condition</strong> in your life. She is not another being, but a reflection of the <strong>assumption you have internalised</strong>.</p>
<p>To say &ldquo;bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh&rdquo; is to declare: <em>This thing I now see or experience in the world was born from my own consciousness. It is not separate from me&mdash;it is of me. It is my inner state made visible.</em></p><p>Eve is described in Genesis 3:2 as the &ldquo;mother of all living,&rdquo; (Eve = "life" or "living") because from her emanates the world of the reader. Yet she brings forth in pain, a reflection of the truth that when imagination is misused&mdash;when assumptions are <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">fearful, negative, or contrary to one&rsquo;s true desire&mdash;the manifestations born from it carry the weight of that misalignment (sin)</a>. The &ldquo;sorrow&rdquo; in childbirth is therefore the natural consequence of giving form to flawed imagining.</p><p>The reference to '<a href="genesis-224-love.html">wife' is the beginning of marriage, bride and bridegroom symbolism</a>. This is the deliberate joining of conscious and imaginative aspects of mind.</p>
<h3><strong>The Mind That Remembers and Responds</strong></h3>
<p>The mind is not a lifeless vessel&mdash;it is a living network that <strong>remembers and responds</strong> to every impression you give it. It reflects the treatment it receives. Speak to it in fear, and it will echo fear. Honour it with the awareness of &ldquo;I AM,&rdquo; and it will return that reverence in form. This <a href="genesis-224-love.html">inner communion between awareness and imagination is the sacred dialogue that the Scriptures call husband and wife.</a></p>
<p>Every woman in Scripture personifies this <strong>responsive mind</strong> in a different stage of awakening. <strong>Sarah</strong> is the imagination long neglected, now turning its gaze toward the pleasure of fulfilled assumption. <a href="sarahs-laughter-humour-of-manifestation.html">She laughs from the first stirrings of joy</a> in realising that conception is possible through faith. <strong><a href="el/hannah-favour-dedication.html">Hannah</a></strong> is the same mind in deep travail, worn from self-pity yet finally pouring itself out before the Lord of Being. In her story, the bitterness of Cain gives way to the yielding of Abel: she stops contending with life and conceives inwardly. <a href="when-frustration-births-faith-hannah.html">When her countenance changes and &ldquo;her face is no longer sad,&rdquo;</a> the conception has already taken place. <strong><a href="ruths-loyalty-and-naomis-rebirth.html">Ruth</a></strong> follows as that mind, once bitter, now choosing devotion to its source&mdash;saying in effect, &ldquo;where you go, I will go.&rdquo; She is the mind that leaves behind its grief and marries its own &ldquo;I AM,&rdquo; the union described in <a href="genesis-224-love.html">Genesis 2:24</a>. 


And <strong>Mary</strong> is the final flowering of this evolution: the mind made <a href="the-virgin-birth-of-love.html">virgin and pure</a>, no longer divided or reactive, but wholly receptive to divine awareness. Her conception is immaculate because her assumption is pure&mdash;she receives nothing but the Word of &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In each of these stages, the same law is at work. The mind remembers, responds, and mirrors back whatever state of being you impress upon it. The &ldquo;woman&rdquo; is therefore the record of how you have treated your own imagination&mdash;your living mirror of God.</p>
<h3><strong>The Crucifixion: Fixing the Idea in Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>This inner dynamic is echoed later in the story of Jesus. Neville explains that the <strong><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html" target="_blank">crucifixion</a></strong> is not a historical event, but the moment when a desire or idea is <strong>fixed in imagination</strong>. The <a href="genesis-224-love.html">&ldquo;nailing&rdquo; of Jesus to the cross represents the commitment to an assumption.</a></p>
<p>Once the state is fixed&mdash;&ldquo;crucified&rdquo;&mdash;it must be resurrected. It must rise into visibility. The outer world, like the <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">&ldquo;woman&rdquo; in Genesis, will take form from the seed of your inner conviction.</a></p>
<p>So, when Adam names the <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-23-series.html">woman</a> and acknowledges her as &ldquo;flesh of my flesh,&rdquo; he is doing what you do when you recognise your own manifestion: owning it. <strong>Every outer circumstance is a "child" of your inner fixation.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Birth of Isaac: Manifestation in Its Season</strong></h3>
<p>This process of inner conception and outer birth is also seen in the story of <strong>Isaac</strong>, born to Sarah after years of barrenness. Sarah represents the <strong>womb of the subconscious</strong>, and Isaac the long-awaited manifestation. Neville often quoted Paul: <em>&ldquo;These things are an allegory&rdquo;</em>&mdash;and indeed they are.</p>
<p><a href="the-birth-of-faith-abraham-as.html">Isaac&rsquo;s birth</a> happens &ldquo;in due season,&rdquo; after the assumption is fully accepted and rests in faith. So too does the woman in Genesis appear after a deep sleep&mdash;a letting go&mdash;just as creation arises when you release the assumption into the subconscious and allow it to gestate.</p>
<h3><strong>Naming as a Creative Act</strong></h3>
<p>&ldquo;She shall be <i>called</i> Woman&hellip;&rdquo;&mdash;naming in Scripture is not just a labelling, but an <strong><a href="genesis-1-creation.html">act of creation</a></strong>. To name is to claim. It is to say, &ldquo;This is what I know it to be.&rdquo; <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">The outer world responds to your inner naming</a>.</p>
<blockquote> 
"Because you are precious in my eyes,
and honored, and I love you,
I give men in return for you,
peoples in exchange for your life." Isaiah 43:4
</blockquote>
<p>Neville said, <em>&ldquo;Change your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live.&rdquo;</em> The woman&mdash;your world, will always take her name from the state you dwell in.</p>
<h3><strong>Final Reflection</strong></h3>
<p>Genesis 2:23 is not an ancient biology lesson&mdash;it is a master key to understanding how the world you experience is <strong>your imagination externalised</strong>. The &ldquo;woman&rdquo; is every result, every condition, every encounter. She's your assumption made flesh. And whether the birth is immediate like Eve or delayed like Isaac, the law is the same: <strong>As within, so without.</strong></p>
<p>Every crucifixion (assumption fixed) leads to resurrection (manifestation revealed). You are both the Adam who imagines and the Eve who appears. You are always meeting yourself in form.</p>
