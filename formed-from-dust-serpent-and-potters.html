<h1>Formed from Dust: The Serpent and the Potter's Clay </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The early chapters of Genesis read like myth, but they move with the rhythm of personal experience. These aren’t primitive tales — they are revelations about consciousness. The symbols of <strong>dust</strong>, the <strong>serpent</strong>, and the <strong>potter’s clay</strong> aren’t historical curiosities. They describe <strong><a href="elohim-god.html">your inner world</a></strong> and how imagination became buried, bound, and eventually awakened in the human condition.</p>
<h3><strong>Formed from Dust: The Burial of Power</strong></h3>
<p>Genesis 2:7 tells us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Then the <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord God</a> formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dust, in this context, isn’t just the stuff of the earth. It represents <strong>the lowest form of substance</strong> — <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> <strong>without awareness of its origin</strong>. But into this dust is breathed <strong>the divine spark</strong> — the <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-breath-series.html">breath of God</a>, the hidden presence of <strong>imagination</strong>.</p>
<p>According to Neville Goddard, imagination is God in action — the creative force itself. So to be made from dust and then filled with breath is to say: <strong>the power that creates worlds has been buried in man’s most limited form</strong>. It is hidden in the ordinary, even the base. <strong>Imagination is in the dust</strong> — not exalted yet, not recognised, but waiting.</p>
<h3><strong>The Serpent: Imagination Crawling</strong></h3>
<p>In Genesis 3:14, the serpent is cursed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“On your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The serpent is not evil — it is symbolic of imagination <strong>fallen</strong>. It is thought operating without vision, instinct without awareness. The crawling belly suggests <strong>a divine faculty brought low</strong>, reduced to reaction, no longer upright or creative.</p>
<p>When imagination identifies with the <strong>dust alone</strong> — the facts, the fears, the surface-level story — it becomes the serpent, eating dust, going in circles. This is <strong>imagination used against itself</strong>, creating a life in the image of worry, doubt, and limitation. It whispers, “This is just how things are,” dragging divine possibility into the realm of the fixed.</p>
<p>But even this is part of the journey. Imagination must descend before it can rise. The serpent is the symbol of <strong>power asleep</strong>, coiled in the subconscious, awaiting its own awakening.</p>
<h3><strong>The Potter and the Clay: Shaping from Within</strong></h3>
<p>Later in Jeremiah 18, we see a complementary symbol:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clay is wet dust — dust that’s been softened, made pliable. And who is the potter? Not a distant deity, but the <strong>imaginative act</strong>. Neville says, “Man is all imagination, and God is man.” That means you — the imaginer — are the potter shaping the clay of your reality.</p>
<p>But notice: <strong>the clay is already within the hand</strong>. This isn’t about building something new from the outside. It’s about <strong>reshaping what already exists within</strong> — the self, the belief, the feeling. Even when the clay is spoiled, the potter doesn’t abandon it. He reshapes it. This is grace — not in a religious sense, but as a <strong>built-in function of imagination</strong>: the power to revise, to redeem, to resurrect.</p>
<h3><strong>The Revelation Hidden in the Dust</strong></h3>
<p>The descent into dust — into form, into limitation — was not a mistake. It was the beginning of a greater return. Imagination <strong>hid itself in the dust</strong> to learn, to experience, to remember. The serpent’s curse is not permanent; it is simply the lowest mode of operation. Once recognised, imagination can stand upright again.</p>
<p>That’s why even in the wilderness, Moses lifts the bronze serpent (Numbers 21:9) — a raised version of what had fallen. This lifting symbolises <strong>the resurrection of imagination</strong>, now understood, honoured, <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">mastered</a> and directed.</p>
<p>And ultimately, <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a> — the true awakened imagination — is described not as crawling, but as <strong>walking</strong>, <strong>teaching</strong>, <strong>declaring</strong>, and finally <strong>being fixed in place</strong>: crucified, not in death, but in <strong>purpose</strong>. As Neville says, the crucifixion represents the moment imagination is fixed in assumption — no longer wandering or reacting, but <strong>consciously creating</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Dust Is Not the End</strong></h3>
<p>The story is not that we were made from dust and must return to it. The story is that imagination <strong>chose dust</strong>, entered it, and <strong>awakens within it</strong>.</p>
<p>You are the potter. You are the serpent lifted up. You are the breath hidden in dust — the divine imagination remembering itself. The dust was not your prison; it was your disguise.</p>
<p>And now, imagination rises.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
