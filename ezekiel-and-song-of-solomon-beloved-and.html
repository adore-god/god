<h1>Ezekiel and Song of Solomon: The Beloved and the Harlot Within the “I Am”</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is an allegory of inner states of consciousness, where every character and event symbolises conditions of the mind and soul. Central to this is the “I Am,” the divine creative imagination within each person.</p><p>In this light, the book of Ezekiel represents a self-correction for turning away one's true nature—the beloved creative self celebrated in the Song of Solomon. Ezekiel’s prophetic language exposes the inner conflict, judgment, and destruction that arise when the soul forgets or misuses its imaginative power. This contrasts with Song of Solomon, which expresses the joyful, intimate union of imagination fully aligned with the “I Am.”</p><p>This article explores parallel imagery in Ezekiel and Song of Solomon, showing how Ezekiel’s language reveals the soul’s self-rebuke for unfaithfulness, while Song of Solomon celebrates the soul’s restored, loving union with its creative source.</p><hr><h3>1. <strong>Adornment: Ezekiel’s Endowment and Betrayal</strong></h3><p><strong>Ezekiel 16:13–15</strong><br>
<em>"Then your fame went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through my splendour that I had bestowed on you, declares the Lord GOD. I clothed you with embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of fine leather; I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments. I adorned you with jewellery, put bracelets on your arms and a chain on your neck. And I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head."</em><br>
<em>"But you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot because of your renown and lavished your harlotries on any passing stranger."</em></p><p>Here, imagination is endowed with beauty and creative gifts, but the soul turns away by identifying with outward appearances rather than the inner “I Am.”</p><p><strong>Song of Solomon 1:10–11</strong><br>
<em>"Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels."</em></p><p>This expresses the natural beauty that arises when imagination aligns with the “I Am,” the creative self adorned in love and faith.</p><hr><h3>2. <strong>Honey and Oil: Ezekiel’s Misuse vs. Song of Solomon’s Nourishment</strong></h3><p><strong>Ezekiel 16:13, 19</strong><br>
<em>"You were adorned with fine flour, honey, and oil, and you were exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty. And your renown went forth among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was perfect through my splendour that I had bestowed on you."</em><br>
<em>"You slaughtered my children and delivered them to them to be slain. Was your prostitution not enough that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up?"</em></p><p>The nourishment from imagination (honey and oil) is given but turned to destruction and false offerings.</p><p><strong>Song of Solomon 4:11</strong><br>
<em>"Your lips drip nectar, my bride; honey and milk are under your tongue. The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon."</em></p><p>This celebrates the sweetness and nourishment of inner creative speech and imagination.</p><hr><h3>3. <strong>Wine: Ezekiel’s Judgment vs. Song of Solomon’s Joy</strong></h3><p><strong>Ezekiel 23:32–33</strong><br>
<em>"You shall drink the cup of your sister's fury, deep and large; you shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria."</em></p><p>Wine here symbolizes overwhelming judgment caused by false identification and turning away from the “I Am.”</p><p><strong>Song of Solomon 1:2, 7:9</strong><br>
<em>"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth— for your love is more delightful than wine."</em><br>
<em>"I said, 'I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.' May your breasts be like clusters of grapes on the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples."</em></p><p>Wine here represents the intoxicating sweetness of living in creative alignment with the “I Am.”</p><hr><h3>4. <strong>Garden: Ezekiel’s Exposed Mind and Song of Solomon’s Enclosed Sanctuary</strong></h3><p><strong>Ezekiel 16:6–14</strong><br>
<em>"When I passed by you and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ I made you thrive like a plant in the field. You grew up and developed and reached full maidenhood. Then you were adorned with jewellery, and your clothing was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth."</em><br>
<em>"Yet you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot because of your renown."</em></p><p>The garden here symbolises the mind and imagination exposed and lost to outer things.</p><p><strong>Ezekiel 36:35</strong><br>
<em>"They will say, ‘This land that was laid waste has become like the garden of Eden; the cities that were laid waste, desolate and ruined, are now fortified and inhabited.’"</em></p><p>This verse points toward restoration, a return to the garden of imagination.</p><p><strong>Song of Solomon 4:12–15</strong><br>
<em>"A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed. Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruits, with henna and nard, nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all the finest spices."</em></p><p>The garden in Song of Solomon symbolises the mind fully enclosed in faith and creative power.</p><hr><h3>5. <strong>Water and Fountain: Ezekiel’s River of Life and Song of Solomon’s Living Waters</strong></h3><p><strong>Ezekiel 47:1, 9</strong><br>
<em>"Then he led me back to the entrance of the temple, and I saw water coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east... Wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish."</em></p><p>Water here represents the flow of restored imagination, bringing life everywhere.</p><p><strong>Song of Solomon 4:15</strong><br>
<em>"You are a garden fountain, a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon."</em></p><p>This is the overflowing, living flow of the “I Am.”</p><hr><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Inner Fall and Restoration of the Creative “I Am”</strong></h2><p>Neville Goddard’s teachings reveal Ezekiel as the voice of the soul’s exile from the creative “I Am,” the destruction of the union celebrated in Song of Solomon. Ezekiel’s harsh imagery exposes the loss, false identity, and inner destruction that come from forgetting the imagination’s true power.</p><p>Song of Solomon’s language offers the joyful, intimate return to this creative power, portraying the soul’s restored union with its imaginative source. Through this inner dialogue, the Bible portrays the soul’s journey from fall to restoration — from exile in illusion back to the creative “I Am.”</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-ezekiel-series.html" class="noTag">Ezekiel Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-song-of-solomon-series.html" class="noTag">Song of Solomon Series</a></p>
