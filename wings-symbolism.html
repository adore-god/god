<h1>Wings Symbolism</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the Bible is not merely a religious text—it’s a psychological manual, a symbolic map revealing how to bring our deepest desires into reality. Every biblical image and story illustrates a principle of creative consciousness, and one of the most powerful of these symbols is the <strong>wing</strong>.</p><p>In Neville’s framework, <strong>wings represent the mental faculties</strong>—specifically <strong>imagination</strong>—that guide the <strong>breath of God</strong>, or divine life force, into manifestation.</p><hr><h2><strong>Wings and the Breath of Life</strong></h2><p>The creative process begins with the <strong>breath of God</strong>, the life-giving Spirit that animates all things:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”</em><br>
— <strong>Genesis 2:7</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville interpreted this breath as symbolic of divine imagination. Just as God breathed life into man, we breathe life into our desires when we assume they are already fulfilled. Imagination becomes the vehicle by which Spirit moves, and <strong>wings</strong> are the tools that direct that movement.</p><hr><h2><strong>The Wind of Spirit: Invisible but Powerful</strong></h2><p>The Bible often uses <strong>wind</strong> as a symbol of Spirit—unseen, yet unmistakably powerful:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.”</em><br>
— <strong>John 3:8</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>To Neville, this wind is the <strong>breath of God</strong>, the creative force that moves through us. When we align our <strong>imagination and assumptions</strong> with it, we guide it toward the manifestation of our desires.</p><p>A beautiful example of this symbolic wind appears in Genesis:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And there came to them the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening wind…”</em><br>
— <strong>Genesis 3:8 (BBE)</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>In Neville’s view, this <em>“evening wind”</em> represents the subtle movement of the divine presence through consciousness. It reminds us that the Spirit of God walks with us—inwardly—through the changing winds of thought and feeling. <strong>Wings</strong> are the faculties that let us <strong>catch</strong> and <strong>direct</strong> this wind into form.</p><hr><h2><strong>Rising Above Limitation: The Eagle’s Wings</strong></h2><p>Manifestation is not just about changing conditions—it’s about <strong>elevating consciousness</strong>. The prophet Isaiah speaks powerfully to this:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.”</em><br>
— <strong>Isaiah 40:31</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Wings here represent the ability to <strong>rise above limitation</strong>. In Neville’s terms, when you assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you lift your mind into a higher state where the desire already exists. <strong>Imagination becomes the wing</strong>, lifting you out of present conditions into the state of fulfillment.</p><hr><h2><strong>Cherubim and the Guardians of Divine Power</strong></h2><p>In the book of Ezekiel, we are given an image of <strong>winged beings</strong>—cherubim—who dwell near the presence of God:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around… and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne.”</em><br>
— <strong>Ezekiel 1:6, 26</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville saw these wings as representations of the <strong>higher faculties of the mind</strong>, particularly the <strong>imaginative faculty</strong> that channels divine energy. Just as the cherubim guide and guard divine presence, our imagination governs how the breath of God is expressed through us.</p><p>We see this theme again in the Psalms:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“He rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.”</em><br>
— <strong>Psalm 18:10</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the wings and the wind unite—an image of Spirit in motion, guided by divine intention. In the same way, our own wings—our thoughts, assumptions, and imagination—carry the wind of God toward our chosen destiny.</p><hr><h2><strong>Imagination as the Wings of Creation</strong></h2><p>According to Neville, <strong>manifestation</strong> is not a matter of effort, but of <strong>assumption</strong>. The moment you inwardly feel that your desire is already real, you impress it upon the subconscious mind, which then brings it into external form.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”</em><br>
— <strong>Mark 11:24</strong></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Belief</strong> is the wind. <strong>Imagination</strong> is the wing. Together, they lift your consciousness into the fulfilled state—where manifestation becomes inevitable.</p><hr><h2><strong>Conclusion: Soaring on the Breath of God</strong></h2><p>In Neville Goddard’s symbolic system, <strong>wings</strong> are not merely poetic flourishes—they are the essential mental faculties through which we <strong>direct the breath of God</strong> into tangible reality.</p><p>Just as a bird uses its wings to ride the wind, <strong>you use your imagination</strong> to ride the Spirit. When you assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you align with divine power, and your desires are carried into expression.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will be safe: his truth is your breastplate and your tower of strength.”</em><br>
— <strong>Psalm 91:4 (BBE)</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>So trust your wings. Let the breath of God move through you. <strong>Assume boldly</strong>, and rise into the life you were always meant to live.</p><p><br></p><div class="share-dropdown">
