<main class="content">
<p></p><blockquote><p>The earth is the LORD&rsquo;s, and everything in it. The world and all its people belong to him.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>
For by him it was based on the seas, and made strong on the deep rivers.<br/>
Who may go up into the hill of the Lord? and who may come into his holy place?</p><p>
He who has clean hands and a true heart; who has not given his soul to what is false, and has not taken an oath for a bad purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>He will have blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.</p><p>
This is the generation of those who are looking for him, who are searching for your face, even Jacob.</p><p>
Let your heads be lifted up, O doors; be lifted up, O you eternal doors: that the King of glory may come in.</p><p>
Who is the King of glory? The Lord of strength and power, the Lord strong in war.</p><p>
Let your heads be lifted up, O doors; let them be lifted up, O you eternal doors: that the King of glory may come in.</p><p>
Who is the King of glory? The Lord of armies, he is the King of glory.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<h2><strong>A Neville Goddard Interpretation: The Inner Gate of Glory</strong></h2>
<p>Psalm 24 isn&rsquo;t a poetic description of an external God&mdash;it is <strong>a map of inner ascent</strong>, a symbolic journey into higher states of consciousness. Through the teachings of Neville Goddard, this psalm unfolds as a pattern of manifestation, self-purification, and spiritual dominion.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Earth is the Lord's</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The earth is the Lord&rsquo;s, with all its wealth..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of creation&mdash;everything in form&mdash;is <strong>the outpicturing of consciousness</strong>. The &ldquo;earth&rdquo; is your world, and it belongs to the I AM. The moment you identify with the Lord within&mdash;your imagination&mdash;you begin to see that nothing is truly external. <strong>The whole world is shaped by the inner assumption</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Hill of the Lord</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Who may go up into the hill of the Lord?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;hill&rdquo; symbolises <strong>elevated awareness</strong>&mdash;the mount of vision, the state where truth becomes realised. It&rsquo;s not a question of morality, but of <strong>inner integrity</strong>. The clean hands and pure heart are symbols of <strong>alignment between thought, feeling, and belief</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Clean Hands and a True Heart</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"He who has clean hands and a true heart..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To ascend, you must leave behind contradiction. Clean hands mean <strong>you no longer act from fear or manipulation</strong>. A pure heart is one that <strong>does not split its attention between faith and doubt</strong>. You are single-eyed, as Jesus said. You believe what you affirm.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>No False Oaths</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Who has not given his soul to what is false..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the challenge Neville constantly addressed: stop investing in the evidence of the senses. <strong>To give your soul to what is false is to accept limitations as final.</strong> The one who can enter the holy place is the one who <strong>persists in the unseen reality</strong>, the imagined truth.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Generation of Seekers</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"This is the generation of those who are looking for him..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To &ldquo;seek the face of God&rdquo; is to search for your true identity. The God you&rsquo;re seeking is not afar off&mdash;<strong>he is your own wonderful human imagination</strong>. You become the generation that manifests the promise when you realise this.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Eternal Doors</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Let your heads be lifted up, O doors..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The doors are <strong>the gates of perception</strong>, the subconscious thresholds that open to new states. To &ldquo;lift up your head&rdquo; is to <strong>rise in awareness</strong>, to lift your inner gaze from the valley to the mountaintop. When you do, the King of Glory enters&mdash;that is, <strong>the divine assumption takes dominion</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Who Is the King of Glory?</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The Lord strong in war..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not external warfare. It is the <strong>inner battle of belief</strong>. The King of Glory is the victorious state, the I AM that has overcome contradiction, doubt, and fear. The Lord of Hosts is the imagination in its commanding, faithful form&mdash;when it no longer wavers.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: Manifestation Through Ascent</strong></h2>
<p>Psalm 24 is not about entering a physical temple. It is about <strong>entering a state of divine embodiment</strong>. When you stop giving your soul to falseness, and instead align fully with your highest assumption, <strong>you lift the gate</strong>, and the new reality enters.</p>
<p>This is the power Neville Goddard spoke of: <em>&ldquo;Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, and persist in that assumption.&rdquo;</em> In doing so, <strong>you become the gate through which glory enters the world</strong>.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
