<p></p><div><img border="0" data-original-height="893" data-original-width="714" height="160" src="images/9241a9e1-f902-4945-820b-079b5f75fc31.png" width="120"/></div>The Bible opens with a garden and unfolds into a love song. If Genesis gives us Eden lost, then the <em>Song of Solomon</em> gives us Eden remembered — not in geography, but in consciousness. Both speak, in symbols, of the same divine romance: the union of man and God, desire and fulfilment, imagination and its object.<p></p>
<h3><strong>Eden: The State of Unbroken Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>In the book of Genesis, Eden is not a place — it is a state of consciousness. It is the condition of man before the fall into duality, judgement, and separation. In Eden, there is no knowledge of good and evil, only experience. This is the childlike awareness Neville Goddard often spoke of — an inner state where imagination flows freely, undisturbed by doubt or limitation.</p>
<p>To “fall” from Eden is to fall from the ease of creative imagining into the labour of reason and effort — to cease living by the law of assumption and begin living by appearances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Garden of Eden is not a piece of geography. It is a state of consciousness in which man lived before he ‘ate of the tree of knowledge.’” – <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>The Song of Solomon: Love as the Way Back</strong></h3>
<p>The <em>Song of Solomon</em> is often misread as erotic poetry. And while it is undeniably sensual, its true meaning lies deeper. It is the soul’s longing for reunion with its creative source — the divine romance between your outer man and your inner awareness.</p>
<p>The Shulamite cries out, “Draw me, and we will run after thee.” This is the deep magnetic pull of the imagination, calling the self home. She searches for her beloved in the streets, in the watchmen, in every outward form — only to discover he was always within.</p>
<p>This is Eden, rediscovered.</p>
<h3><strong>The Garden Within</strong></h3>
<p>At one point in the <em>Song of Solomon</em>, the beloved is called a “garden enclosed.” This echoes Eden, but with one distinction: this garden must now be consciously entered.</p>
<p>Where Eden in Genesis is lost through unconscious assumption (the acceptance of outer appearances as truth), the garden in <em>Song of Solomon</em> is regained through deliberate love and desire — the conscious alignment of oneself with their inner vision.</p>
<p>“Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.” – <em>Song of Solomon 4:16</em></p>
<p>This is the awakening of imagination — the breath of the Spirit stirring the senses into creation.</p>
<h3><strong>David: The Beloved of the Inner I AM</strong></h3>
<p>Here, the symbolism of <strong>David</strong> becomes essential. His name in Hebrew means <em>beloved</em> (דָּוִד). In Neville Goddard’s teachings, David is not just a king — he is the <strong>spiritual son</strong>, the <strong>manifested state</strong>, the thing longed for and finally realised.</p>
<p>David is the <em>evidence</em> that the inner man (the Father) has awakened to his true creative identity. He is the child born of inner union — the beloved of the I AM.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The day you truly awaken, David stands before you and calls you Father. Then you know you are God.” – <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the “beloved” sought in the <em>Song of Solomon</em> is not a person, but a <strong>state of being</strong> — a state whose fulfilment is David himself, the conscious and beloved manifestation of your assumption.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Garden is You — and the Beloved is Yours</strong></h3>
<p>Eden and the <em>Song of Solomon</em> both point inward. They are not stories of exile and yearning, but of return and remembrance. Eden is not gone — it is concealed within consciousness. And the beloved is not lost — he is <em>David</em>, your realised desire, born of your own inner union.</p>
<p>You are the garden.<br>
You are the seeker.<br>
And you are the beloved.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-eden-series.html" class="noTag">Eden Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-song-of-solomon-series.html" class="noTag">Song of Solomon Series</a></p>
