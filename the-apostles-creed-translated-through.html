    <h1>The Apostles' Creed Translated Psychologically</h1>
    The Apostles' Creed is a timeless affirmation of faith, and when understood through the lens of Neville Goddard’s teachings, it becomes a guide to transformation. <p><strong>I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>God</strong> = the creative power within us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Father</strong> = the source of imagination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Almighty</strong> = limitless potential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creator</strong> = the act of imagining both inner (heaven) and outer (earth) realities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, God represents the creative force within each of us. The Father is the imagination—the root of all creation. The Almighty reminds us that we possess limitless creative potential through our imagination, which shapes our internal and external worlds.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ</strong> = the embodied “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Only Son</strong> = the unique expression of our assumption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Our Lord</strong> = the sovereign guidance of imagination</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The “I AM” is the Christ within us, the full embodiment of our assumptions and inner creations. Jesus Christ, as our "Lord," means we acknowledge the power of imagination to direct and guide our experiences.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Holy Spirit</strong> = the spark of inspiration in imagination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conceived</strong> = the moment a new assumption is formed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virgin Mary</strong> = a pure, receptive mind free from old limitations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Holy Spirit is the inspiration that fills the mind, sparking new assumptions. Just as the Virgin Mary represents purity and receptivity, our minds must be open and free from past constraints to fully receive and conceive new possibilities.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Suffered</strong> = the clash with old beliefs and outer conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crucifixion</strong> = nailing the new assumption firmly in the mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Died &amp; buried</strong> = releasing the old self completely</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The process of transformation often involves the struggle to let go of outdated beliefs. The crucifixion symbolizes the act of locking in a new assumption in the mind, while death and burial signify the release of the old identity and limitations.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>He descended to the dead. On the third day, he rose again.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Descended</strong> = the low point of doubt or disconnection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Third day</strong> = the moment of rebirth when the assumption begins to manifest</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The descent represents moments of doubt or disconnect from the new assumption. However, on the “third day,” the assumption begins to manifest—rebirthing us into a new identity.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>He ascended into heaven, he is seated at the right hand of the Father.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ascended</strong> = elevation of consciousness into the new state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seated at the right hand</strong> = full alignment with the creative power</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ascension is the lifting of our consciousness into the new assumption. Seated at the right hand of the Father signifies our alignment with divine creation, resting in the authority of the imagination.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>From there, he will come to judge the living and the dead.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Judge</strong> = distinguishing between old and new states of being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Living</strong> = those in the vibrant assumption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dead</strong> = those still bound by outdated beliefs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The “judgment” occurs within us—distinguishing between our old, limiting beliefs and the new identity we’ve assumed. The “living” are those who live in the vibrant energy of their new assumption, while the “dead” remain stuck in old, outdated beliefs.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>I believe in the Holy Spirit.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Holy Spirit</strong> = the ever-flowing current of imagination that inspires new visions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Holy Spirit continues to inspire and guide us in our creative journeys, fueling new assumptions and visions.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The holy catholic Church, the communion of saints.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Church</strong> = the collective field of assumed realities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communion of saints</strong> = the shared energy of all who master assumption</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The "Church" represents the collective field of consciousness we all contribute to. The "communion of saints" symbolizes the energy shared between those who consciously master their assumptions and rise into their new states of being.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The forgiveness of sins.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Forgiveness</strong> = letting go of limiting beliefs and past mistakes, clearing the way for new assumptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Forgiveness in this context means releasing all doubts, negative beliefs, and past mistakes—clearing the path for our new self and creative assumptions.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The resurrection of the body.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Resurrection</strong> = the renewal of our physical reality in line with the imagination’s assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Resurrection is the manifestation of our new assumptions into physical form. What we imagine, we resurrect into our lives.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>And the life everlasting.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Everlasting life</strong> = the unending creative flow of imagination, continuously birthing new experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The life everlasting represents the continuous and infinite flow of imagination that we tap into to create new realities, constantly evolving and growing into higher states of being.</em></p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Through imagination, we are both the dreamer and the dream.”</em><br/>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>By reading the Apostles' Creed through Neville Goddard’s framework, we see it as a powerful guide to transformation. Each line represents the creative process we undergo—moving from the assumption in the mind to the manifestation of a new identity, always renewing and evolving through the power of imagination.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-devotional-series.html">Devotional Series</a> | <a href="label-elohim--god-series.html">Elohim: God Series</a></p>
