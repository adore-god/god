<h1>Absalom's Hair</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>When interpreted through Neville Goddard’s teachings, Absalom becomes more than a figure of rebellion. He represents a <strong>stubborn assumption</strong> — a <a href="genesis-126-man.html">self-image</a> that refuses to let go of the old identity that created it. This is the inner meaning of Genesis 2:24:</p>
<blockquote>“A man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife…” — Genesis 2:24</blockquote>
<p>These are not physical parents, but psychological ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Father</strong> — the current belief about who I am</li>
<li><strong>Mother</strong> — the emotional state that sustains that belief</li>
</ul>
<p>To assume a new identity — the “wife” — we must leave the old assumption entirely (<a class="noTag" href="genesis-224-love.html">Genesis 2:24</a>). But Absalom refuses to leave. He clings to the former mental state, demanding lordship over consciousness. That is why he rebels against David — <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David symbolises the <strong>new beloved assumption</strong></a>, the rightful king in the mind.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Hair as Thoughts — The Ego Accumulated</h2>
<p>The Bible emphasises Absalom’s hair — its beauty, its weight, its growth year after year. Symbolically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every hair is a thought</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>weight</strong> = attachment to appearance and validation</li>
<li>The <strong>growth</strong> = persistence of old self-concept</li>
</ul>
<p>These thoughts are formed from the world of appearances — the <strong><a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</a></strong>. They judge, compare, and divide. They create the ego, the false self (<a href="the-ego-and-true-i-am.html">the personal “me”</a>) that fights to stay alive.</p>
<p>So the very thing Absalom gloried in — his mental self-image — becomes the trap.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Suspended Between Heaven and Earth</h2>
<blockquote>“His head caught fast in the oak … he was left hanging between the heaven and the earth.” — 2 Samuel 18:9</blockquote>
<p>The oak represents the old mental system of judgement (<a href="genesis-111-seed.html">the seed growing according to its kind</a>). Absalom is lifted from the ground but never reaches heaven. He hangs between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heaven</strong> — the unseen reality of assumption</li>
<li><strong>Earth</strong> — the evidence of the senses</li>
</ul>
<p>When a long-held belief refuses to die — when the past still claims to rule — the result is this suspended state: unable to move forward, yet no longer grounded in truth.</p>
<p>Even the mule — the stubborn animal nature — runs on without him. The old ways cannot carry him any further.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Necessary Death of the Old Assumption</h2>
<blockquote>“Joab … thrust them through the heart of Absalom…” — 2 Samuel 18:14</blockquote>
<p>This is not vengeance, but symbolism. The old belief must be pierced so the new may reign. The <strong>former state of being must die</strong> so a new identity may take its place:</p>
<ul>
<li>David = Love assumed → <strong>the rightful king</strong></li>
<li>Absalom = Ego’s old claim → <strong>a throne that must fall</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Neville taught that transformation requires crucifixion of the old idea — the fixing of the new <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM”</a> in the mind. The death is not literal — it is psychological liberation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Inner Lesson</h2>
<p>Absalom reveals a law:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Any thought that refuses to leave its “father and mother” will eventually hang itself.</strong></blockquote>
<p>If we cling to assumptions <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">born of the senses forgetting his origin (sin)</a>, the weight of those thoughts grows heavy and immobilising. But when we set the new assumption over our inner kingdom, the ego must yield.</p>
<p>To unite with the <a href="https://god.thway.uk/genesis-224-love.html">“wife”</a> — the desired assumption — we must depart from the mental parents that birthed the former one. Pride dies. Duality dies. The stubborn beauty of the old belief is surrendered.</p>
<p><strong>Let Absalom go. Let David reign.</strong></p>
