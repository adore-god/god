<h1>The Marriage Supper of the Lamb: Entering Union Through Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p><em></em></p><blockquote><p><em>“Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.”</em></p><p>
— Revelation 19:9</p></blockquote><div><img alt="Bride Lamb Icon The Way" border="0" data-original-height="1151" data-original-width="1458" height="158" src="images/1748897268844.jpg" width="200"/></div><p>The Book of Revelation is often mistaken for a cryptic prophecy of end-times events. But as Neville Goddard taught, it is not about external history — it is about <em>inner transformation</em>. The <em>Marriage Supper of the Lamb</em> is one of the clearest symbolic illustrations of the Law of Assumption in all of Scripture.</p><p>It describes what happens when you no longer court your desire as something outside yourself — but instead <em>unite</em> with it, embody it, and live from it. You marry the state you seek. You become one with it. This is not a metaphor for romance — it is the mystical process of manifestation.</p><p>Let’s explore this sacred imagery through Neville’s teachings:</p><hr><h3><strong>Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.</strong></h3><p>— <em>Revelation 19:7</em></p><p>Neville often spoke of <em>preparing the state</em> — entering into the assumption with readiness, sincerity, and reverence. The <em>Lamb</em> represents the pure state — the ideal, the perfected image — and the <em>wife</em> is your consciousness, preparing to unite with that state through assumption.</p><p>To <em>make yourself ready</em> means to drop all doubt, double-mindedness, or feelings of separation from the desired state. It is to cleanse yourself of resistance and be “arrayed” in the identity of what you choose to become.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>marriage</em> is your mystical union with the state you desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>wife making herself ready</em> is your willingness to adopt the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Lamb</em> is the perfected version of you — the I AM expressed as your fulfilled state.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This aligns directly with <strong>Genesis 2:24</strong>, where it is written:<br>
<em>“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”</em><br>
— <em>Genesis 2:24</em></p><p>This ancient verse is not about literal matrimony — it symbolises <em>leaving the old state behind</em>, severing ties with what you once were (father and mother representing the past or origin of self-concept), and <em>cleaving</em> to a new assumption. When you fully commit to your chosen state, you and it become <em>one flesh</em> — indistinguishable, inseparable. This union is the essence of manifestation.</p><hr><h3><strong>And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.</strong></h3><p>— <em>Revelation 19:8</em></p><p>This verse reveals the <em>garment of consciousness</em>. Neville taught that you clothe yourself in states — just as you wear garments. The white linen symbolises purity of assumption: no contradiction, no hidden “but what if not?” thoughts.</p><p>To be clothed in <em>righteousness</em> is to be in right alignment with your chosen identity. Not through moral superiority, but through clarity and commitment to the inner act.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>White linen</em> = assumption without doubt or interference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Righteousness</em> = oneness with the state of the wish fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Granted</em> = this is grace, not effort — the moment you yield fully, you are “granted” the identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This also echoes Neville’s teaching that you do not have to force the world to conform — you simply <em>wear the state</em>, and the world reflects it.</p><hr><h3><strong>And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.</strong></h3><p>— <em>Revelation 19:9</em></p><p>This is the celebration — the moment of embodiment. The <em>supper</em> is symbolic of inner nourishment and fulfilment. It is not just the union of the state and the self, but the <em>feasting on its reality</em>. You don’t just marry the assumption — you <em>enjoy it</em>. You taste the experience inwardly before it ever appears outwardly.</p><p>To be <em>called</em> to this supper is to awaken to the Law of Assumption — to understand that you are the bride being invited to union with your desire.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>marriage supper</em> is the inward enjoyment of the assumed state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Blessed are they which are called</em> — those who awaken to imagination as God, and accept the invitation to live in the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Write</em> — the instruction to make this truth permanent and conscious.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr><h3><strong>The Song of Solomon: The Sensual Undercurrent of Assumption</strong></h3><p>While Revelation gives us the <em>form and triumph</em> of mystical union, <strong>The Song of Solomon</strong> reveals its <em>emotional and sensual undercurrent</em>. It is the secret life of the bride — her yearning, longing, and deep absorption in the beloved.</p><p>Crucially, the woman in <em>The Song of Solomon</em> is explicitly identified as the bride — the very consciousness preparing to be united with the Lamb. For example, in <em>Song of Solomon 4:8–9</em>, the bridegroom calls her:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: … Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The Hebrew term translated as <em>“spouse”</em> (<strong>kallah</strong>) means bride — the prepared woman who will enter union. This mirrors Revelation’s <em>“wife hath made herself ready”</em>, showing the same inner reality from a different angle.</p><p>The Shulamite’s passionate pursuit is not passive longing but the active, emotional embodiment Neville describes as essential to successful assumption:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go.”</em> — <em>Song of Solomon 3:4</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This reflects the inner act of assumption — finding the feeling and <em>holding</em> it despite outer circumstances.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine.”</em> — <em>Song of Solomon 6:3</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This declaration marks the moment of identification, the perfect union Neville taught: the consciousness no longer separate from the fulfilled state but one with it.</p><p>The Song thus reveals the emotional richness beneath the mystical marriage — the <em>spiritual romance</em> of the soul utterly captivated by its fulfilled vision. The bride’s longing and intimacy exemplify the <em>feeling</em> that must underlie the Law of Assumption.</p><hr><h3><strong>Neville’s Interpretation: Marriage as Mystical Union</strong></h3><p>Neville did not teach that this passage referred to a literal wedding in the sky. For him, <em>marriage</em> meant <em>identification</em>. When you assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you are no longer separate from your desire — you become it.</p><p>He often said, <em>“You are now married to that state. You take its name. You live in its house.”</em> This is the Law in action.</p><p>The “bride” (your consciousness) does not chase the Lamb (the ideal state). She prepares herself, clothes herself in assumption, and enters into union with it. That is manifestation. That is salvation. And that is what the whole Bible is about — moving from separation to unity, from hoping to <em>being</em>.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html" class="noTag">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-bride---bridegroom-series.html" class="noTag">Bride — Bridegroom Series</a> | <a href="label-marriage-series.html" class="noTag">Marriage Series</a> | <a href="label-revelation-series.html" class="noTag">Revelation Series</a> | <a href="label-song-of-solomon-series.html" class="noTag">Song of Solomon Series</a></p>
