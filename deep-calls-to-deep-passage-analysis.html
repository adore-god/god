    <h1>Deep Calls to Deep: Passage Analysis </h1>
    <p><strong>“Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls;</strong></p><p><strong>Al</strong><strong>l your waves and breakers have swept over me.</strong></p><p><strong>
By day the Lord directs his love,<br/>
at night his song is with me—a prayer to the God of my life.”</strong><br/>
<em>(Psalm 42:7-8)</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>This passage mirrors the inner workings of Neville Goddard’s teachings on imagination and manifestation. The “deep calling to deep” reflects the subconscious mind responding to the desires of the conscious mind. Our deepest desires, those thoughts and feelings that stir us at our core, are not merely wishes—they are signals sent to the subconscious to be accepted as truth, to become an inner reality. This is the essence of Neville’s concept of <em>assumption</em>. When we assume the feeling of our desire as fulfilled, we call forth the deep, the unseen, into physical manifestation.</p>
<p>The <strong>"waves and breakers" </strong>symbolise the ever-moving flow of thoughts that ripple through our consciousness. They represent the emotional intensity and resistance that often accompany the process of manifesting. These turbulent moments are not obstacles but the natural friction of the old self, the "old man," breaking apart as the new self is brought into being. Just as a wave crashes and recedes, our doubts and fears emerge to be dissolved, making way for the creative power of our imagination to take hold.</p>
<p>And just as the Psalmist writes, <strong>“By day the Lord directs his love,”</strong> Neville teaches that to <em>assume the wish fulfilled</em> is to walk in the consciousness of already having what we desire. By walking in the assumption that our desire is already realised, we align ourselves with the divine creative power. This is how, you, “the Lord directs his love".</p>
<p><strong>“At night, his song is with me”</strong> is a reminder of the importance of the subconscious, or the “night” within us. Neville often spoke of the power of the subconscious in shaping our outer world. It is in the quiet, in the stillness of the night, that we impress our desires upon the subconscious through feeling, imagination, and faith. The "song" is the inner dialogue, the affirmations, the praise, the mental imagery that continues to shape our reality even when we are not consciously aware of it.</p>
<p>When we manifest, we are harmonising with the divine order of imagination. The storms of life, the turbulence of our emotions, are not to be feared—they are part of the process of creation. The deeper we go, the more we call upon our imagination to shape and transform our experience. In this way, the "waves" are not setbacks, but the necessary passage through which we refine and assert the dominion of our imagination over our circumstances.</p><p>Neville Goddard teaches that the "God of my life" is not an external being but the creative power within—our imagination</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-psalms-series.html">Psalms Series</a></p>
