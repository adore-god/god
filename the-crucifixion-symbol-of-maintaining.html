<h1>The Crucifixion: A Symbol of Maintaining the Assumption Despite Opposition</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>When we view the Bible through Neville Goddard’s framework of the <em>Law of Assumption</em>, every event and character becomes a reflection of the mind’s power to shape reality through sustained belief and imagination. The crucifixion of Jesus, one of the most pivotal events in the Bible, represents the <strong>culmination of maintaining the assumption</strong> despite mounting opposition and external contradictions.</p><p>In Neville’s teachings, the <em>Law of Assumption</em> states that to manifest a desired reality, one must assume the state of already having that which they desire, regardless of the present circumstances. The external world, with all its trials, doubts, and challenges, serves merely as resistance that must be overcome. The crucifixion is the ultimate metaphor for this process: the persistence in assuming a state of divinity, despite all external evidence to the contrary.</p><h2><strong>Assumption Amidst Opposition: The Crown of Thorns and Mockery</strong></h2><p>Throughout his life, Jesus maintained the assumption that he was the Christ—the embodiment of divine purpose. Yet, as he approached the cross, external appearances seemed to shout the opposite. The mockery, the crown of thorns, the desertion by his followers, and the harsh judgment all stood in stark contrast to his assumed identity.</p><p>These elements of the crucifixion symbolize the <strong>external opposition</strong> that Neville frequently discusses in his teachings: the <strong>obstacles and doubts</strong> that arise when we maintain an assumption against all odds.</p><h2><strong>The Crown of Thorns: External Pressure and Limitation</strong></h2><p>The crown of thorns placed on Jesus' head by his tormentors is one of the most poignant symbols of opposition. Thorns, by their nature, are painful and uncomfortable, and the crown of thorns can be seen as a metaphor for the <strong>mental and emotional discomfort</strong> that accompanies holding an assumption when everything around you seems to contradict it.</p><p>In Neville’s framework, the crown of thorns symbolizes <strong>the mental pressures and limiting beliefs</strong> that seek to impose themselves on your state of assumption. It’s as if the mind is being pierced by doubts, fears, and the overwhelming evidence of the external world. The thorns are the constant reminders of everything you are trying to overcome: the doubts that say you’re not good enough, the societal norms that tell you it’s impossible, or the naysayers who mock your dream.</p><p>But the crown itself is a <strong>badge of honor</strong>. Just as Jesus wore it as a symbol of the external opposition he faced, so too must we <strong>wear our own thorns</strong>—acknowledging the resistance but <strong>refusing to let it change our assumption</strong>. The crown represents the external world’s attempts to impose its limitations, but it is only when we persist in the assumption despite these pressures that we can truly overcome them.</p><h2><strong>Mockery: The Outer World’s Resistance to Your Assumed Reality</strong></h2><p>Another powerful symbol of opposition during the crucifixion is the mockery Jesus endured. He was mocked by the soldiers, the crowd, and even the criminals crucified beside him. They ridiculed him for claiming to be the King of the Jews, questioning his power and authority. This mockery is a profound symbol of <strong>how the outer world often reacts when you begin to assume an identity or reality that contradicts the world’s current understanding of you</strong>.</p><p>In Neville’s teachings, the outer world is simply a reflection of your assumptions and beliefs. When you decide to assume a state that contradicts the external appearances—whether it’s success, love, or personal transformation—the world will often mock or dismiss this new state as unrealistic, impossible, or absurd. Just as the crowd mocked Jesus, people in our lives may ridicule us for our beliefs and assumptions that go against the current external reality.</p><p>But here’s the key: Neville teaches that <strong>this mockery is not a sign of failure</strong>, but rather a sign that you are on the verge of manifesting your desired reality. The world mocks because it does not yet understand the power of your assumption. The mockery is merely a <strong>resistance</strong> to the change you are about to create.</p><h2><strong>The Bliss of Assumption: The Inner Peace Amidst the External Struggle</strong></h2><p>While the crown of thorns and the mockery symbolize external resistance, Neville teaches that <strong>manifestation is blissful</strong>. The true nature of manifestation is not just about changing the external world but about experiencing <strong>inner fulfillment, joy, and peace</strong> as you hold the assumption that your desire is already realized.</p><p>In the face of external opposition, Jesus exemplified what it means to be at peace with the assumption. Despite the pain, mockery, and struggle, he maintained the assumption of his divine identity. Neville often stated that when you assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you align yourself with <strong>bliss</strong>—the sense of joy and satisfaction that comes with knowing that your desired outcome is already accomplished.</p><p>The bliss doesn’t come from the external reality changing first, but from the <strong>internal state</strong> of assuming the desired end. Jesus, in his crucifixion, is a representation of <strong>inner peace despite external turmoil</strong>. The crown of thorns, the mockery, and all external suffering didn’t disturb the inner peace that came from his unwavering assumption. In Neville’s terms, Jesus held the <strong>assumption of his divine state</strong> with joy and confidence, despite the outward signs of defeat.</p><p>This inner bliss—knowing and feeling that it is already done—is what transforms the external world. Jesus' ability to endure the crucifixion with peace, despite its external appearances, is a powerful metaphor for how we, too, can endure opposition with joy when we hold firm to our assumption of the desired state.</p><h2><strong>"It Is Finished"—The Culmination of Assumption</strong></h2><p>At the moment of his crucifixion, Jesus’ final words—<em>"It is finished"</em>—are profound when understood through Neville’s teachings. This declaration doesn’t signify defeat or resignation; rather, it symbolizes <strong>the completion of the assumption</strong>. Jesus, in this moment, affirms that his assumed identity, the Christ, has been fully realized. He has remained steadfast, and now the external world must yield to the internal assumption.</p><p>Neville teaches that when we persist in our assumption—despite the external contradictions and seeming obstacles—the assumption must <strong>eventually harden into fact</strong>. Jesus' death represents the moment when the assumption is held so firmly that it is “finished,” regardless of how it looks on the outside. The external reality must shift to align with the inner belief.</p><h2><strong>The Resurrection: The Manifestation of the Assumed State</strong></h2><p>Following the crucifixion comes the resurrection, which Neville would interpret as the manifestation of the assumed state. The resurrection is not just a supernatural event; it symbolizes the <strong>fulfillment of the assumption</strong>. The power of the assumption that Jesus was the Christ, even in the face of overwhelming opposition, leads to the manifestation of his divine identity.</p><p>This teaches us that when we persist in our assumptions, no matter how much the world pushes back, the end result will eventually materialize. Just as Jesus’ resurrection followed the crucifixion, our assumptions will bring about the manifestation of our desires, once we have fully embraced and persisted in them.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Power of Persistent Assumption and Inner Bliss</strong></h2><p>The crucifixion, when interpreted through Neville Goddard’s <em>Law of Assumption</em>, becomes a powerful lesson in the art of persistence and the bliss of manifestation. It shows that <strong>the key to manifestation is unwavering faith in the assumed state</strong>, regardless of the external circumstances. Jesus’ story, as the ultimate symbol of the Law of Assumption, teaches us that even when external appearances seem contrary to our assumptions, if we remain steadfast, our assumed reality must manifest.</p><p>By maintaining the assumption of our desired state, even in the face of opposition, we, too, can experience the bliss of fulfillment—an inner peace that arises from knowing that our desires are already accomplished. The Bible’s message is clear: <strong>persist, assume, and feel the bliss of your wish fulfilled</strong> as it brings your reality into alignment with your inner world.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
