<h1>Jachin and Boaz: The Two Pillars of Solomon's Temple</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Scripture, the two pillars, <strong>Jachin</strong> and <strong>Boaz</strong>, stood at the entrance of Solomon&rsquo;s Temple (1 Kings 7:21; 2 Chronicles 3:17). The Temple represents the <strong><a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">head as the house of consciousness</a></strong>, the inner mind where new states of being are assumed. More specifically, Solomon's Temple represents a <strong>temple of consciousness</strong> and a carefully and <a href="building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html">exaltedly constructed I AM</a>. The pillars show the essential supports for consciously establishing and maintaining an <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">inner assumption</a>.</p>
<h3>Jachin: Establish Your Assumption</h3>
<p><strong>Jachin</strong> means &ldquo;He will establish.&rdquo; This pillar represents the conscious act of <strong>firmly assuming a new state</strong>. It is the decision: <em>&ldquo;I AM that.&rdquo;</em> Jachin is the foundation of inner transformation. Without this conscious step, change cannot take place.</p>
<h3>Boaz: Fleetness to Maintain It</h3>
<p><strong>Boaz</strong> means &ldquo;fleetness.&rdquo; This pillar represents the <strong>speed and agility of the conscious mind</strong> in maintaining your assumption. It ensures that your inner declaration stays active and responsive, even when circumstances outside appear contrary.</p>
<h3>Masculine Pillars: Conscious Support</h3>
<p>In the Bible and Neville Goddard&rsquo;s symbolic language, <strong>male figures represent the conscious mind</strong>, the part of you that decides and directs. <strong>Female symbols</strong> represent the imagination, the receptive field where assumptions take shape and are brought into form.</p>
<p>Jachin and Boaz together show how the <strong>conscious mind and imagination work</strong> to create new realities. The conscious mind establishes the assumption (Jachin), and the fleetness of Boaz ensures it is maintained and brought into form.</p>
<h3>The Temple Porch: Threshold of Assumption</h3>
<p>The Temple porch, where these pillars stand, is the <strong>threshold between thought and active assumption</strong>. Walking between them represents moving from wishing or thinking into <strong>firm conscious assumption</strong>. Beyond the veil lies the receptive subconscious, ready to produce the reality of your inner declaration.</p>
<h3>Jesus Walks in Solomon&rsquo;s Porch</h3>
<p>John 10:23 says: <em>&ldquo;And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.&rdquo;</em> This illustrates the same principle. <a href="el/solomons-portico-place-of-wisdom.html">Walking between the pillars &mdash; Solomon's Portico &mdash;</a> symbolizes moving from conscious decision into alignment with inner fulfilment. A few verses later, <a class="noTag" href="i-and-father-are-one-interpreted.html">Jesus declares, <em>&ldquo;I and my Father are one&rdquo;</em> (John 10:30)</a>. This reflects the union of conscious assumption and its realisation in imagination.</p>
<h3>Faith and Strength Working Together</h3>
<p>As James 2:17 says: <em>&ldquo;Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by works, is dead.&rdquo;</em> In this framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jachin</strong> = conscious faith and establishment of the assumption.</li>
<li><strong>Boaz</strong> = the fleetness to maintain and support that assumption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are required to bring any inner state into realisation. Together, they form the doorway to conscious creation.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Passing Between the Pillars</h3>
<p>Jachin and Boaz remind us that <strong>all transformation starts in the conscious mind</strong>. One pillar establishes the new state, the other moves swiftly to sustains it. By standing between them in your awareness, you actively assume: <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">&ldquo;I AM that.&rdquo;</a></strong> You become the living Temple of your own conscious power.</p>
