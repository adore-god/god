<h1>Jachin and Boaz: The Two Pillars of Solomon's Temple </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In Scripture, the two mighty pillars named <strong>Jachin</strong> and <strong>Boaz</strong> stood at the entrance of Solomon’s Temple (1 Kings 7:21; 2 Chronicles 3:17). More upmarket than <a href="the-spiritual-significance-of-passover.html">doorposts</a>, these pillars are more than architectural ornaments — they symbolise the essential roles of the <strong>conscious mind’s support in spiritual creation</strong>, a concept beautifully brought to life through Neville Goddard’s teachings.</p><h3>Jachin: "He will establish"</h3><p>The pillar <strong>Jachin</strong> represents the act of establishing a firm assumption — the decisive moment when you claim, “I AM” that which you desire to be. It symbolises your <strong>conscious commitment</strong> to a new identity or state of being, the foundation upon which everything else rests.</p><h3>Boaz: "In him is strength"</h3><p><strong><a href="ruth-and-boaz.html">Boaz</a></strong> signifies the strength and steadfastness required to support and maintain this assumption. It embodies the <strong>conscious courage</strong> to persist in your chosen state regardless of outer appearances, showing the <strong>unwavering strength</strong> necessary to carry your inner declaration into full expression.</p><h3>Masculine Pillars: Conscious Supports</h3><p>Both Jachin and Boaz are masculine symbols. In biblical and Neville’s symbolic language, <strong>male figures always represent the conscious, directive aspect of mind</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>imagination</strong> is consistently symbolised by the woman — the bride, the womb, the earth, or deep <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">waters — as the <strong>receptive, fertile space</strong> where assumptions are impressed and brought to life</a>. The male impresses; the female receives and produces form.</p><p>Thus, <strong>Jachin and Boaz</strong> stand as conscious supports, <strong>inner establishment and strength</strong> — the unwavering pillars needed for true spiritual transformation.</p><h3>The Temple Porch: Threshold of Creation</h3><p>The porch of Solomon’s Temple serves as the <strong>symbolic threshold</strong> where conscious <a href="building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html">assumptions pass into the sacred inner sanctuary</a>. Walking between <strong>Jachin and Boaz</strong> represents moving beyond mere wishing into <strong>firm assumption</strong> — the living, confident declaration of <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM.”</a></p><p>Behind these pillars hung the veil, separating the <strong>Holy Place</strong> from the <strong>Holy of Holies</strong>. Beyond this veil — in the inner sanctuary — the <strong>union of assumption (conscious) and imagination (subconscious)</strong> takes place, bringing forth new realities.</p><h3>Jesus Walks in Solomon’s Porch: The Threshold of “I AM”</h3><p>In <strong>John 10:23</strong>, we read:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This detail is deeply symbolic. The <strong>porch of Solomon’s Temple</strong>, flanked by the pillars <strong>Jachin</strong> and <strong>Boaz</strong>, was the <strong>threshold</strong> between the outer court and the sacred inner spaces. To walk there is to stand <a href="building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html">between the known and the revealed — between assumption and fulfilment</a>.</p><p>A few verses later, <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> declares:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I and my Father are one.”</em> — <strong>John 10:30</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>This <a href="i-and-father-are-one-interpreted.html">statement of unity follows His walk through the symbolic threshold</a>. Here, <strong>Jesus embodies “The Way”</strong> — not merely a path to God, but the <strong>process of divine assumption</strong>. He is the conscious declaration ("I AM") made one with its fulfilment.</p><p>Just as <strong>Jachin</strong> represents the <strong>establishment</strong> of a new state and <strong>Boaz</strong> the <strong>strength</strong> to sustain it, <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus’ walk in Solomon’s porch symbolises the moment we move from believing to being </a>— from outer rituals to inner knowing.</p><p>When you walk spiritually between Jachin and Boaz, you enter this same space — the sacred interior of your being — and proclaim, <strong>“I AM that.”</strong> You do not look for salvation; you assume it. You are no longer at the gate — you are the temple itself.</p><h3>Faith and Strength Working Together</h3><p>As <strong>James 2:17</strong> declares, <em>“Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by works, is dead.”</em> In this spiritual framework:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jachin</strong> embodies <strong>faith</strong> — the establishment of your inner assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Boaz</strong> embodies <strong>strength</strong> — the persistence and support that uphold that faith.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Together, these two pillars <strong>frame the doorway to manifestation</strong>. Without the establishment of a new state (<strong>Jachin</strong>) and the strength to remain faithful to it (<strong>Boaz</strong>), no creative transformation can truly unfold.</p><h3>Conclusion: Passing Between the Pillars</h3><p>Jachin and Boaz remind us that <strong>transformation begins in the conscious mind</strong>. They stand as eternal witnesses to your inner declaration and your unwavering commitment to live from that new state.</p><p>Beyond them lies the veil — and beyond the veil, the receptive subconscious, ready to bring forth the fruit of your inner union.</p><p>When you pass between Jachin and Boaz in consciousness, you boldly proclaim, <strong>“I AM that.”</strong> You enter the <strong>living temple</strong> of your own creative power and step into the world as the fulfilled expression of your chosen state.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-architecture-series.html" class="noTag">Architecture Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-solomon-series.html" class="noTag">Solomon Series</a></p>
