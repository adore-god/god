<h1>Twelve Sons and Tribes: List of Attributes </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The twelve tribes of Israel are not just names in an ancient lineage — they are <a href="elohim-god.html">symbolic faculties of mind, the inner <em>Elohim</em> or "judges and powers" named God that shape your self-perception</a>. Each tribe, through its Hebrew meaning, represents a distinct mental or emotional quality contributing to the creative process within.</p><p>Later, these tribes find their echo in the twelve disciples of Jesus. This shift from tribes to disciples is not simply a historical or generational change — it is a psychological evolution: a movement from dispersed, unconscious potentials to consciously named and directed powers supporting the assumption. The <a href="lukes-genealogy-lineage-to-god.html">lineage of Christ shows the names of the psychological states passed through</a>.</p><p>This narrative traces the journey through the Law of Assumption, revealing how the inner Elohim — your many mental states — must be harmonised and consciously commanded to create your desired world. What you inwardly accept as true is precisely what your outer world reflects.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>The Births of Consciousness: From Promise to Dominion</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a></strong> cleaved to <em>faith</em>, and <strong>the promise</strong> was born.</p>
<p><strong>Isaac</strong> cleaved to <em>assurance</em>, and <strong>joy in the unseen</strong> was born.</p>
<p><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Jacob</a></strong> cleaved to <em>persistence</em>, and <strong>Israel — he who rules as God</strong> was born.</p>
<p>From Israel arise the <strong>children of development</strong> — each a state awakened within:</p>
<p><a href="reubens-mistake-why-your-subconscious.html"><strong>Reuben</strong></a> cleaved to <em>sight</em>, and <strong>awareness</strong> was born.</p>
<p><a href="he-who-has-ears-to-hear-hearing-as.html"><strong>Simeon</strong></a> cleaved to <em>hearing</em>, and <strong>understanding</strong> was born.</p>
<p><a href="levi-levites-aaron-and-jesus-symbolism.html"><strong>Levi</strong></a> cleaved to <em>alignment</em>, and <strong>union with the Holy</strong> was born.</p>
<p><a href="scrolls/label-judah-series.html"><strong>Judah</strong></a> cleaved to <em>praise</em>, and <strong>dominion</strong> was born.</p>
<p><a href="judgement-and-righteousness-neville.html"><strong>Dan</strong></a> cleaved to <em>judgement</em>, and <strong>discernment</strong> was born.</p>
<p><a href="naphtali-struggle-liberation-meaning-manifest.html"><strong>Naphtali</strong></a> cleaved to <em>release</em>, and <strong>good news</strong> was born.</p>
<p><strong>Gad</strong> cleaved to <em>victory</em>, and <strong>overcoming</strong> was born.</p>
<p><a href="asher-happy-blessed.html"><strong>Asher</strong></a> cleaved to <em>blessing</em>, and <strong>joy</strong> was born.</p>
<p><strong>Issachar</strong> cleaved to <em>devotion</em>, and <strong>reward</strong> was born.</p>
<p><a href="zebulunthe-sea-honour-and-dwelling.html"><strong>Zebulun</strong></a> cleaved to <em>dwelling</em>, and <strong>harbour</strong> was born.</p>
<p><a href="scrolls/label-joseph-series.html"><strong>Joseph</strong></a> cleaved to <em>imagination</em>, and <strong>fruitfulness</strong> was born.</p>
<p><a href="scrolls/label-benjamin-series.html"><strong>Benjamin</strong></a> cleaved to <em>union</em>, and <strong>the beloved son</strong> was born.</p>
<p>Each name carries its Hebrew meaning — a faculty of mind or a state of consciousness brought to life through the Law of Assumption. The journey flows from the faith of Abraham to the beloved son Benjamin, a complete evolution of inner faculties, culminating in the conscious embodiment - <a href="elohim-god.html">Elohim</a> — of all creative judgement, rulership and potential.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: A Symbolic Evolution</strong></h2>
<p>The twelve tribes symbolise <strong>faculties</strong>. The disciples embody <strong>functions</strong>. One prepares, the other performs. This is the journey from scattered identity to spiritual embodiment—a twelvefold path that begins in the subconscious and ends in full creative authority.</p>
<p><strong>Twelve tribes. Twelve disciples. One transformed mind.</strong></p>
