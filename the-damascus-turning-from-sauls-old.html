<h1>Saul to Paul <br> The Road to Damascus and the Scales</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<img alt="Saul Damascus Icon The Way" src="images/wp/paul-damascus.webp" width="167">


<p>The account of <a href="samuel-david-and-saul.html">Saul</a> on the road to Damascus is one of the clearest examples of how the Bible speaks in psychological, not historical, language. When read symbolically, the story is not describing a supernatural punishment followed by a miraculous healing, but a profound inner reversal of perception.</p>

<p><strong>The “scales falling from Saul’s eyes” represent the collapse of self-judgement based on appearances.</strong></p>

<p>Before this moment, <a href="samuel-david-and-saul.html">Saul</a> is utterly convinced that he sees correctly — morally, spiritually, intellectually. Yet the text insists that he is blind. This contradiction is deliberate. Symbolically, Saul’s vision is dominated by judgement: right and wrong, worthy and unworthy, success and failure, saint and sinner. He measures both himself and others by external conditions and visible outcomes.</p>

<p><a href="elohim-god.html">This is significant because the Bible names God in Genesis as <strong>Elohim</strong> — a plural term meaning <em>judges</em> or <em>rulers</em></a>. <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">Creation itself begins through judgement</a>, not condemnation, but through the power of definition: “let there be.” Judgement, in Scripture, is not punishment — it is the act of assigning meaning.</p>

<p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, Saul is operating from a state of consciousness that believes judgement comes <em>from the world</em>. Experience appears to deliver verdicts, and circumstances seem to rule his sense of self. But the Bible exposes this as inversion: it is Saul himself who is judging and ruling his experience through assumption.</p>

<h3>The light on the road to Damascus</h3>

<p>The light that stops Saul is not new information or instruction. It is <strong>revelation</strong>. It exposes the inner contradiction of his state. The very thing he believes he is defending — God, righteousness, truth — is what he is persecuting by judging.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Why persecutest thou <em>me</em>?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question strikes at the heart of Exodus 3:14 — <strong>“I AM THAT I AM.”</strong> To judge the self through appearances is to persecute the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM”</a>. It is to treat awareness as something ruled by outcomes, rather than recognising it as the ruling principle itself.</p>

<p>In other words, Saul is attempting to act as a servant of God while unknowingly <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">judging and ruling</a> against God — because God, in Scripture, is the <em>I AM</em>.</p>

<h3>The meaning of the scales</h3>

<p>When the scales fall from Saul’s eyes, something specific is removed. Scales are <em>filters</em>. They symbolise interpretive overlays — the habits of seeing oneself through consequence, history, morality, reaction, and comparison.</p>

<p>With the removal of these filters, Saul no longer reads experience as a verdict on his worth. The world ceases to function as a courtroom. Self-accusation, previously reinforced by conditions, loses its authority.</p>

<p>In simple terms, Saul stops judging himself by what he sees — and therefore stops misusing the creative power of judgement that Genesis assigns to Elohim.</p>

<p>This is the same inner movement Neville describes when a person stops asking, <em>“Is this working?”</em> and instead rests in assumption. Vision returns not because circumstances change, but because the ruling interpretation changes.</p>

<h3>Why Saul becomes Paul</h3>

<p>The <a href="explaining-names-changes-in-bible.html">name change</a> marks the completion of this reversal. Saul, whose name carries the sense of demanding or asking, becomes Paul — meaning small or humbled. This is not humiliation, but <strong>humility of vision</strong>.</p>

<p>Paul no longer stands over life as judge. He stands within it as awareness.</p>

<p>From this point onward, the meaning of Jesus becomes clear. Jesus means <em>Salvation</em> — not rescue from the world, but rescue from misjudgement. <strong>I AM saves.</strong> Salvation is the release from condemning the self through appearances.</p>

<p>From this state, Paul’s teaching necessarily shifts. Faith replaces works. Inner conviction replaces outer law. Grace replaces condemnation. These are not theological preferences; they are the natural expressions of a consciousness no longer ruling itself against itself.</p>

<p>As long as the scales remain, judgement is misdirected. Only when judgement collapses back into awareness does vision return.</p>

<p>To “see” in the biblical sense is not to predict outcomes or control appearances, but to recognise that awareness itself is the judge, the ruler, and the source from which all meaning flows.</p>
