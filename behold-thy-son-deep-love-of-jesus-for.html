<h1>Behold Thy Son: Mary Mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>At the cross, in one of the most intimate moments recorded in Scripture, Jesus declares:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Woman</a>, behold thy son!"</em> (John 19:26)</p>
</blockquote><p>Traditionally seen as a simple gesture of earthly care, this phrase holds a much deeper symbolic meaning when interpreted correctly as the law of Assumption. It reveals the transformation of states, the movement from old attachments to a fully embraced new identity, and the true nature of spiritual resurrection.</p><h2>The Mother and the Pattern of Old Attachments</h2><p>In this moment, Jesus’s mother represents the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">familiar pattern of "mother and father"</a> mentioned in Genesis 2:24:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Spiritually, "father and mother" symbolise our old states, old habits, and inherited emotional patterns — all the ideas and attachments we previously identified with. They form the background conditioning that keeps us tied to past identities.</p><h2>Mary Magdalene: The Evolved State of Feeling</h2><p>Mary Magdalene, standing faithfully at the cross, embodies the evolved emotional nature — the refined, conscious acceptance of a new state. She represents the aspect of us willing to leave behind the old framework ("father and mother") and fully unite with the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">new chosen state ("wife"),</a> becoming one with it in feeling.</p><p>Unlike the old emotional patterns, she stands unwavering, holding to the vision of the new life even as the old identity (Jesus as old state) dies. Her devotion symbolises our capacity to faithfully embody a new assumption, without reverting to former states.</p><h2>"Behold Thy Son": A Call to Accept the New State</h2><p>When Jesus says, <em>"Behold thy son,"</em> it is far more than assigning care. It is a profound spiritual command:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>To turn away from the old states (the "mother and father" patterns of Genesis 2:24).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To embrace and claim the new state ("son") as the only reality.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the moment where the old self (tied to past patterns) is left behind, and the new self is fully adopted and nurtured into expression. In symbolic terms, Mary Magdalene accepts the "son" — the new identity — as already real, thus allowing its resurrection into the world.</p><h2>The Parallel Movement: To the Father and To the New State</h2><p>At the same time, Jesus says he goes to the Father — symbolising a return to pure <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">"I AM" awareness</a>, the source from which all states arise.</p><p>Mary Magdalene, however, is directed toward the "son," representing the new state or manifestation that must now be lived and embodied.</p><p>This mirrors Genesis 2:24: one leaves the old (father and mother) to <a href="genesis-224-love.html">unite with a new identity (wife) and become one flesh</a>. Mary Magdalene, therefore, does not regress to old subconscious attachments; rather, she cleaves fully to the new state and embodies it with unwavering devotion.</p><h2>Reuben: "Behold, a Son!"</h2><p>The phrase <em>"Behold thy son"</em> also echoes <a href="twelve-tribes-summary-law-of-assumption.html">Reuben’s name</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"Because the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me. And she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me."</em> (Genesis 29:32)</p>
</blockquote><p>Reuben means <em>"Behold, a son!"</em> — the first expression of a new identity. In this scene at the cross, we witness the perfected echo of that idea: not a first, tentative attempt, but a conscious, fully embraced new state of being.</p><h2>Conclusion: The Inner Resurrection</h2><p>"Behold thy son" is not simply a farewell. It is an instruction to fully release the old framework of self (the "father and mother") and accept the new state as living reality.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Jesus returns to the Father (the "I AM"): pure awareness beyond all states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mary Magdalene, as the devoted feeling nature, accepts and embodies the new son: the new assumed identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In doing so, the soul leaves behind its old attachments and is reborn in union with its chosen state — just as Genesis 2:24 commands.</p><p>This is the hidden mystery of resurrection: the transition from the habitual self to the consciously chosen, fully accepted new identity — brought to life by unwavering love and devotion.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-bible-verse-analysis.html" class="noTag">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-23-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 2:23 Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-24-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 2:24 Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-jesus-christ--salvation.html" class="noTag">Jesus Christ: SALVATION</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-women-in-the-bible-series.html" class="noTag">Women in the Bible Series</a></p>
