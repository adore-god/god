<h1>How Christianity Has Killed God</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<blockquote>“God is spirit: and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth.” — John 4:24</blockquote><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Reflection on the Loss of the Living Presence</h3><p>Not through malice—but through misunderstanding.</p><p>Much of mainstream Christianity has unintentionally turned the living presence of God into a remote figure—someone seated far off in the heavens, detached from the daily experience of man. By placing God <em>outside</em> of the individual, it has made Him unreachable, unknowable, and conditional.</p><p>In doing so, it has killed the <strong>immediate God</strong>—the God who, as Neville Goddard and the mystics understood, lives <em>within</em>.</p><hr/><h2>The Real Culprit? A Literal Reading of Scripture</h2><p>This is not simply a critique of tradition, but a call to reawaken the meaning behind it.<br/>
The true weapon in this unintentional crucifixion of God is a <strong>literal interpretation</strong> of the Bible.</p><p>By reading Scripture as external history instead of psychological symbolism, the church has transformed the Bible into a book about <em>other people</em>—long ago and far away. It no longer serves as the living, breathing autobiography of the soul’s awakening.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Symbol becomes superstition.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metaphor becomes mythology.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revelation becomes routine.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><hr/><h2>The Kingdom Is Within You</h2><blockquote>“The kingdom of God is within you.” —Luke 17:21
</blockquote><p>This is not poetic language. It is a bold spiritual fact.</p><p>Your own <strong>imagination is God</strong>, and your <strong>awareness of being</strong> is the divine name: <em>I AM</em>.</p><p>And yet Christianity often teaches people to worship a distant deity—leading them to pray outwardly, plead for intervention, and wait for miracles, rather than to <strong>awaken</strong> and realise their identity with the divine.</p><hr/><h2>Worship Without Awakening</h2><p>This externalised view creates:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Dependency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guilt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A subtle spiritual <em>powerlessness</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>You wait for signs. You wait for salvation. You wait for God.</p><p>All the while, the power to transform your life sits <strong>quietly within</strong>, waiting for your recognition.</p><hr/><h2>In Killing the Indwelling God…</h2><p>...Christianity has unknowingly buried the very <strong>Christ</strong> it claims to follow.</p><p>But resurrection is not only possible—it is promised.</p><blockquote>“Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.” — Ephesians 5:14
</blockquote><hr/><h2>The Real Gospel: A Call to Awaken</h2><p>The true gospel is not about bowing before an external judge.</p><p>It is an invitation:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>To awaken as the Son of God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To become the Son of Man who hears from <em>within</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To declare in truth: <strong>“I and my Father are one.”</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is not blasphemy.</p><p>It is the <strong>deepest reverence</strong>: to honour God not by shrinking before Him, but by <em>realising</em> Him—as your very own consciousness.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
