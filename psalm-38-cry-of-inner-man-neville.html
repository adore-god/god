<h1>Psalm 38 – The Cry of the Inner Man: A Neville Goddard Interpretation</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p><em></em></p><blockquote><p><em>“O Lord, do not be angry with me in your wrath, or send your wrath on me in the heat of your passion.”</em></p><blockquote><p>
— <strong>Psalm 38:1, BBE</strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psalm 38 is often read as a psalm of sorrow and affliction. But through the lens of Neville Goddard’s teachings, we uncover something deeper: the <strong>inner man</strong> crying out after realising he has imagined contrary to the truth of being. This is not about divine punishment, but about <strong>spiritual alignment</strong>, the experience of being out of tune with our true identity—<strong>I AM</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Invisible Law at Work</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For your arrows have gone deep into me, and your hand is pressing hard on me.”</em><br>
— Psalm 38:2, BBE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Neville’s framework, the “arrows” and “hand” represent the <strong>automatic and impersonal law</strong> of imagination. It's the attempt to hit the mark but failing. What we dwell upon internally will reflect externally. The psalmist is not being punished, but experiencing the <strong>inevitable harvest</strong> of his own mental activity.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Sin as 'Missing the Mark'</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“My flesh is wasted because of your wrath; and there is no peace in my bones because of my sin.”</em><br>
— Psalm 38:3, BBE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Neville, sin simply means to miss the mark and self-wound —to <strong>imagine unlovely things</strong> or persist in fearful, limiting inner conversations. The body and world around us are the mirrors of our inner state, and when we live in contradiction to our ideal, suffering follows.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Overwhelming Flood of Miscreation</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For my crimes have gone over my head; like a great weight they are more than my strength.”</em><br>
— Psalm 38:4, BBE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse captures the moment when the <strong>illusion of separation</strong> becomes unbearable. The inner man, trapped in a self-created state, begins to realise he cannot escape until he changes from within.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>A Mourning Soul</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I am troubled, I am made low, I go weeping all the day.”</em><br>
— Psalm 38:6, BBE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mourning reflects the state of one who <strong>believes the outer world to be causative</strong>. The soul suffers when it forgets that imagination is the source and attempts to fix things externally. Neville would say this is the cry of the <strong>“old man”</strong>, caught in the illusion of material cause and effect.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Desire: The First Light of Redemption</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Lord, all my desire is before you; my sorrow is not kept secret from you.”</em><br>
— Psalm 38:9, BBE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Desire, in Neville’s teaching, is a <strong>divine gift</strong>—the movement of God within man. Even in despair, the soul calls out not to an external being, but to <strong>its own deeper self</strong>, acknowledging that what is longed for exists within.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Turning Point: Hope and Faith</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For my hope is in you, O Lord: you will give an answer, O Lord, my God.”</em><br>
— Psalm 38:15, BBE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the beginning of faith—the assumption of a new state. The psalmist starts to <strong>shift identity</strong>, recognising that salvation is not granted from outside, but from <strong>a change in consciousness</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Repentance as Realignment</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I will make clear my wrongdoing, I will be sad because of my sin.”</em><br>
— Psalm 38:18, BBE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville often said that true repentance is a <strong>radical change of attitude</strong>, not a performance of guilt. The psalmist here becomes aware that his suffering came from living in the wrong state—and now chooses to <strong>move inwardly</strong> toward the ideal.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>A Cry from the Inner Saviour</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Come quickly to give me help, O Lord, my salvation.”</em><br>
— Psalm 38:22, BBE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This final plea is not from someone begging a distant God, but from the <strong>awakening self</strong>, remembering its own creative power. “Lord, my salvation” becomes a declaration: <strong>“I AM salvation.”</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Drama of Awakening</strong></h3>
<p>Psalm 38 can be seen as the inner journey from <strong>misalignment to remembrance</strong>, from imagining in fear to returning to the truth of being. Through Neville Goddard’s perspective, we read this not as religious lament, but as the <strong>psychological pattern of transformation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, the realisation of suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the recognition of self-inflicted wounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the return to the truth: <strong>I and my Father are one.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The psalmist is not a sinner to be punished, but a dreamer <strong>awakening to his creative power</strong>.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-bible-verse-analysis.html" class="noTag">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-psalms-series.html" class="noTag">Psalms Series</a></p>
