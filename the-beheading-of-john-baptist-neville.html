<h1>The Beheading of John the Baptist: A Neville Goddard Interpretation of Inner Transformation</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The beheading of <strong>John the Baptist</strong> (Matthew 14:1–12; Mark 6:14–29) is often read as a moment of political cruelty or personal vengeance. But from the mystical lens of <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, it becomes something far deeper: a profound parable of the <strong>death of the old self</strong>, the <strong>severing of external reasoning</strong>, and the <strong>awakening of divine imagination</strong>.</p><hr><h2><strong>John the Baptist: The Outer Man Who Must Decrease</strong></h2><p>In Neville’s teachings, <strong>John the Baptist</strong> represents the <strong>external self</strong>, the forerunner of truth. He symbolises the <strong>preparatory mind</strong>, the voice crying out for repentance—which Neville interprets as a <strong>radical change in consciousness</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“He must increase, but I must decrease.”</em> — <em>John 3:30</em></p>
</blockquote><p>John's role is essential, but temporary. His very name, <strong>Yochanan (Hebrew: יוֹחָנָן)</strong>, means <em>“God is gracious.”</em> Grace prepares the way—but it must <strong>give way</strong> to something higher: the realisation of the <strong>I Am</strong>, the divine imagination embodied in the figure of Jesus.</p><hr><h2><strong>Herod: The Fragmented Mind Torn Between Worlds</strong></h2><p><strong>Herod Antipas</strong>, who ordered the beheading, is a conflicted figure. His name derives from Greek roots that may be interpreted as <em>“hero’s song”</em> or <em>“son of a hero,”</em> suggesting a persona concerned with <strong>external image, ego, and power</strong>.</p><p>He represents the <strong>part of consciousness that recognises spiritual truth but is enslaved by worldly attachments</strong>—unable to fully let go of the old paradigm. He admired John, yet feared the political consequences of protecting him.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake... he commanded it to be given her.”</em> — <em>Matthew 14:9</em></p>
</blockquote><hr><h2><strong>Herodias: The Ego’s Grudge Against Truth</strong></h2><p><strong>Herodias</strong>, Herod’s unlawful wife, orchestrates John's death. Her name may stem from <strong>“heroic” or “daughter of a hero”</strong>, echoing Herod’s name. She symbolises the <strong>egoic self</strong>, attached to outer reputation and hostile to inner truth.</p><p>In Neville’s symbolism, she is the <strong>inner resistance</strong>—that aspect of us which clings to appearances and is threatened by the radical message of inner transformation.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not.”</em> — <em>Mark 6:19</em></p>
</blockquote><hr><h2><strong>Salome: Desire Without Awareness</strong></h2><p>Though not named in the Gospels, historical sources refer to Herodias' daughter as <strong>Salome</strong>. The name possibly derives from <strong>Shalom (שָׁלוֹם)</strong>—<em>“peace.”</em> Ironically, she becomes an instrument of <strong>inner conflict</strong>.</p><p>Salome represents <strong>desire that lacks spiritual direction</strong>. She dances—evoking the <strong>movement of attention</strong> Neville often describes—and becomes the vehicle by which <strong>impulse, when manipulated by ego (Herodias), destroys the preparatory truth (John).</strong></p><hr><h2><strong>The Beheading: Cutting Off the Outer Man</strong></h2><p>The beheading of John is not just a literal execution—it is the <strong>symbolic removal of the old mental framework</strong>. In Neville’s terms, it is the death of the <strong>outer man</strong>, the part of us that relies on logic, ritual, and moral striving, so that the <strong>inner divine imagination</strong> may arise.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.”</em> — <em>John 12:24</em></p>
<p><em>“The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.”</em> — <em>1 Corinthians 3:19</em></p>
</blockquote><hr><h2><strong>Spiritual Meaning: The Shift From Reason to Revelation</strong></h2><p>The death of John prepares the way for the full manifestation of Christ—the <strong>awakening of the imagination</strong>, where man realises his identity as God.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The kingdom of God is within you.”</em> — <em>Luke 17:21</em></p>
<p><em>“Let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”</em> — <em>James 1:7–8</em></p>
</blockquote><p>John’s end is <strong>not a tragedy</strong>, but an <strong>initiation</strong>—the irreversible shift from <strong>preparation to possession</strong>, from <strong>seeking to knowing</strong>.</p><hr><h2><strong>Conclusion: Sever the Head, Awaken the Heart</strong></h2><p>In your own journey, <strong>John dies</strong> each time you silence doubt, abandon the senses, and trust the <strong>inner reality</strong>. <strong>Herod</strong> is overcome when you stop fearing the crowd. <strong>Herodias</strong> loses power when you let go of ego. And <strong>Salome’s dance</strong> becomes a movement of divine desire rather than manipulation.</p><p>The moment you <strong>cut off the reasoning head</strong>, you allow divine imagination—Jesus within—to take full expression.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“He must increase, but I must decrease.”</em> — <em>John 3:30</em></p>
</blockquote><p>That is the mystical beheading: the moment the <strong>outer dies</strong>, and the <strong>divine self awakens</strong>.</p><p><br></p><div class="share-dropdown">
