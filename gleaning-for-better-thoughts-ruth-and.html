    <h1>Gleaning for Better Thoughts: Ruth and the Emotional Guidance System</h1>
    <p>Abraham Hicks teaches that alignment isn’t found through sudden leaps into joy, but by gently <em>reaching for the next better-feeling thought</em>. This approach—steady, receptive, and humble—finds a powerful symbolic mirror in the biblical story of Ruth, who gleaned in the fields of Boaz.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>The Wisdom of Gleaning</h3>
<p></p><blockquote>"Glimmers” — Modern speak for those little sparks of insight, hope, or subtle signs of positive change.</blockquote><p></p><p>Gleaning is the quiet act of gathering what remains—of choosing what is useful and nourishing from what others might overlook. Ruth doesn’t force abundance or demand a harvest. She simply shows up and collects what she can, a handful at a time.</p>
<p>This reflects Abraham Hicks’ “emotional guidance scale.” We are not asked to jump from despair to joy, but to shift gradually. Just as Ruth collects leftover grain, we gather thoughts that feel a little better than the last.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You never get it done and you can’t get it wrong.”</em> — Abraham Hicks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no spiritual deadline. Like Ruth, we move forward by receiving what’s available, not by demanding what isn’t.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>A Moment of Realisation</h3>
<p>Many people approach spiritual growth with urgency—thinking they must instantly replace sadness or worry with joy. But that pressure often creates resistance.</p>
<p>Picture someone, weighed down with emotion, pausing to reach for a gentler thought: <em>“Maybe I don’t have to fix everything today.”</em> That one shift is like a single grain gathered in Ruth’s field—seemingly small, yet quietly transformative. From there, another thought becomes reachable, and then another.</p>
<p>Over time, this soft rhythm of selection becomes a kind of inner harvesting. It’s not loud or immediate, but it is lasting.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Boaz and the Symbol of Alignment</h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s symbolic understanding of scripture, every biblical character represents a state of consciousness. Boaz—the field owner and “kinsman-redeemer”—can be seen as <strong>divine alignment</strong> or <strong>inner provision</strong>. He notices Ruth not because she strives, but because she abides. She remains faithful to the process.</p>
<p>When we continue to show up with patience—gathering better thoughts rather than demanding breakthroughs—we, too, become visible to our own inner Boaz. Provision begins to appear. Ruth is told that “handfuls on purpose” will be left for her.</p>
<p>This is the fruit of faithful thought. Not striving, but trusting. Not leaping, but gleaning.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>The Field Is Already Yours</h3>
<p>You don’t need to own the field to gather what nourishes. You only need to be willing to show up with awareness and care. The better-feeling thought is already there, like grain left intentionally for those who trust the process.</p>
<p>Ruth’s journey is a beautiful reminder: when you shift your attention gently, consistently, and faithfully, you align yourself with unseen provision. What begins as gleaning ends in belonging.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-ruth-series.html">Ruth Series</a></p>
