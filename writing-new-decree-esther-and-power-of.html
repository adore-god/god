<h1>Writing the New Decree: Esther and the Power of Subconscious Command</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The Book of Esther is often celebrated for its dramatic rescue of a people in peril—but beneath the historical narrative lies a symbolic instruction for spiritual transformation. Interpreted through the teachings of Neville Goddard, the moment when Esther and Mordecai write to the Jews in the king’s name becomes a profound image of how inner authority rewrites our reality.</p>
<h3><strong>The Cast of Inner Characters</strong></h3>
<p>As Neville taught, the Bible is not secular history but a psychological drama unfolding within the individual. The figures in Esther’s story are not distant personalities but symbols of our inner landscape:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Esther</strong> – The hidden self, the subconscious mind, cloaked in silence yet crowned with the capacity to shape destiny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mordecai</strong> – The voice of intuitive wisdom, representing inner guidance aligned with the truth of being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The King</strong> – The I AM, the divine power of awareness from which all decrees and manifestations proceed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Haman</strong> – The critical voice, the self-destructive thought or belief that seeks to annihilate the truth of who you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Jews</strong> – The scattered inner states and subconscious impressions—those parts of you awaiting a new instruction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Power of the Written Word</strong></h3>
<p>After Haman’s downfall, Mordecai is clothed in royal garments and given authority. The king tells Esther and Mordecai to write “as it pleases you, in the king’s name,” and seal it with the king’s ring. Although the earlier decree of destruction cannot be revoked, a <strong>new decree can be issued</strong>—one that empowers the Jews to stand, defend, and prevail.</p>
<p>This moment is a perfect mirror of <strong>Neville’s teaching on revision and assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>We cannot erase the past directly, just as Esther cannot erase the previous letter. But we <strong>can override it</strong> by issuing a new belief, a new mental decree, impressed upon the subconscious with the authority of the I AM. This is how transformation happens—not by resisting what has been, but by commanding what <em>is to be</em>.</p>
<h4><strong>Esther 8:8 – The Power to Decree</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“So now give orders in writing about the Jews, as seems good to you, in the king's name, and put the king's stamp on it: for a letter in the king's name, stamped with the king's stamp, may not be changed.”</strong><br>
<em>(Esther 8:8, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Writing to the Inner Provinces</strong></h3>
<p>The Jews dwell across “127 provinces,” each one representing a fragment of consciousness within the self. When Esther and Mordecai write to every province, they are <strong>sending a new vibration to every layer of the subconscious</strong>. This is not a surface affirmation—it is a saturation of the inner world with a new decree.</p>
<p>When you assume a new state—whether of abundance, healing, love, or peace—you are, in effect, writing to all your inner provinces. You are saying: “Let this be the truth now. Let every part of me obey.”</p>
<h4><strong>Esther 8:10 – Sending the New Word</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“He had the letters sent by men on horseback, who were mounted on horses from the king's stable, offspring of his best horses.”</strong><br>
<em>(Esther 8:10, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>The King's Ring: Sealing the Assumption</strong></h3>
<p>Neville often spoke of the importance of feeling—the “sealing” of the assumption. The king’s ring is the subconscious's deep acceptance of the idea. To write in the king’s name and seal it is to move beyond mere thought into <em>felt reality</em>. It is to embody the statement “I AM,” followed by the new truth you accept as real.</p>
<p>This is not mere writing. It is <strong>creative decree</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Application: How to Write Your Own Decree</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify the Old Decree</strong><br>
What inner message has ruled you? “I never succeed.” “I’m always anxious.” “I don’t belong.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hear Mordecai’s Voice</strong><br>
Within you is a higher awareness—one that knows who you truly are. Let it rise and speak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assume the New Decree</strong><br>
Write it, speak it, imagine it. “I AM fulfilled.” “I AM chosen.” “I AM safe.” This is your Esther moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seal It with Feeling</strong><br>
Feel its reality. Let it touch your emotions. Let the subconscious accept it as already so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Send It to the Provinces</strong><br>
Repeat, live from it, dream through it. Let every part of your being receive the new message.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Esther 9:1 – The Fulfilment of the New Assumption</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month... when the king’s order and his law were about to be put into effect, the Jews’ haters were hoping to overcome them; but their hopes were turned to nothing, and the Jews overcame their haters.”</strong><br>
<em>(Esther 9:1, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Esther as the Gatekeeper of Subconscious Reception</strong></h3>
<p>It’s significant that Esther, the symbol of the subconscious, does not act rashly. She waits, fasts, and approaches the king with precision. This reminds us that the subconscious does not accept any random idea—it is impressed only through focused attention, emotional intensity, and reverence. Her story shows us how to bring our assumptions into union with the I AM. Esther waits for the right moment to speak and touches the sceptre—that is, she aligns feeling with assumption. The sceptre extended represents the granting of permission for a new decree to enter.</p>
<h3><strong>The Scribe and the Rider: Thought and Feeling</strong></h3>
<p>When the decree is written, it’s dictated to scribes and delivered by riders. The scribes represent focused thought—the clarity of the assumption. The riders, mounted on swift horses from the royal stables, represent the emotional force or feeling that carries the decree into manifestation. These are not ordinary messengers—they are royal and fast, meaning that the deeper the emotional impact, the more swiftly the subconscious responds.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Courage to Command</strong></h3>
<p>Esther’s story is not just one of bravery—it is one of authorship. It shows us that we are not bound by the letters written in fear or condemnation. The I AM within us gives us permission to write again, to speak a higher word, and to watch the entire world respond.</p>
<p>In Neville’s words:<br>
<em>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, and live and act upon this conviction.”</em></p>
<p>You are Esther. You are Mordecai. You are the king.<br>
And your word—when written in truth—<em>never returns void</em>.</p>
