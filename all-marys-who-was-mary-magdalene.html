<h1>Mary Magdalene: Tower and Fortress </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In the teachings of <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, the Bible is not a literal history but a <strong>symbolic map</strong> of the human mind and its spiritual journey. The characters within the Bible represent various <strong>states of consciousness</strong>, and by understanding them metaphorically, we gain insight into our own spiritual evolution. When examining <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong>, we can view her not merely as a historical figure, but as a <strong>symbol of the subconscious mind</strong> undergoing purification and transformation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Meaning of "Magdalene"</strong></h2>
<p>The name <strong>Magdalene</strong> is derived from the town of <strong>Magdala</strong>, which is thought to come from the Hebrew word <strong>"migdal"</strong> (מִגְדָּל), meaning <strong>"tower"</strong> or <strong>"fortress"</strong>. In this context, <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> can be interpreted as <strong>"of the tower"</strong>, symbolising <strong>strength</strong>, <strong>protection</strong>, and the <strong>elevation</strong> of the mind.</p>
<p>Through Neville Goddard’s metaphysical lens, <strong>the tower</strong> can symbolise the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, a powerful and <strong>receptive</strong> force capable of manifesting desires once it is cleansed and aligned with the desires of the <strong>conscious mind</strong> (represented by <strong>Jesus</strong>). The tower metaphor implies that the subconscious, when purified, becomes a <strong>fortress of creative power</strong>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Mary Magdalene as the Subconscious Mind</strong></h2>
<p>Neville often explained that the Bible’s characters represent psychological states, and in this case, <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>. She is the <strong>feminine principle</strong>—the <strong>receptive</strong> aspect of consciousness that <strong>nurtures</strong> and <strong>brings forth</strong> the desires planted by the conscious mind (represented by <strong>Jesus</strong>). In the Gospels, <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> is described as having been <strong>healed of seven demons</strong> by Jesus (Luke 8:2; Mark 16:9), a metaphor for the cleansing of the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> from <strong>negative thoughts</strong>, <strong>fears</strong>, and <strong>limiting beliefs</strong> that prevent the manifestation of our desires.</p>
<p>The act of <strong>casting out demons</strong> is a powerful metaphor in Neville’s teachings for the process of <strong>mental purification</strong>. Just as Mary Magdalene was cleansed of her demons, we must cleanse our subconscious mind of <strong>negative thought patterns</strong> and <strong>blockages</strong> to align it with the creative power of the conscious mind. Only when the subconscious is <strong>freed from these limitations</strong> can it fully manifest the desires planted by the conscious mind.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Feminine Principle: The Subconscious Mind as the Tower</strong></h2>
<p>In Neville’s work, the subconscious mind is often seen as the <strong>feminine principle</strong>, the <strong>receptive</strong> force that <strong>nurtures</strong> and <strong>brings forth</strong> what the conscious mind desires. The symbolism of the <strong>tower</strong> aligns with this concept perfectly, representing a <strong>fortified</strong>, <strong>protected</strong>, and <strong>elevated</strong> state. When <strong>purified</strong>, the subconscious mind becomes a <strong>powerful vessel</strong> for manifestation.</p>
<p>This is not just about cleansing the mind but also about <strong>elevating</strong> it to a higher state of consciousness. The <strong>tower</strong> suggests a mind that is <strong>strong</strong>, <strong>protected</strong>, and <strong>capable</strong> of bringing forth the creative desires of the conscious mind. It’s a symbol of a <strong>subconscious mind</strong> that has been <strong>purified</strong>, <strong>elevated</strong>, and is now <strong>aligned</strong> with the creative power of the imagination.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Different Marys: Shifts in Consciousness</strong></h2>
<p>Within Neville Goddard's framework, it's also helpful to consider the other <strong>Marys</strong> in the New Testament as representations of different stages in the <strong>evolution of consciousness</strong>. All the Marys—<strong>Mary, the mother of Jesus</strong>, <strong>Mary of Bethany</strong>, <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong>, and others—symbolise <strong>aspects of the subconscious mind</strong> undergoing significant <strong>shifts in awareness</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary, Mother of Jesus</strong>: Symbolises the <strong>conscious mind</strong>, the <strong>imagination</strong> that conceives new creations and ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary Magdalene</strong>: Represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, particularly the process of <strong>cleansing</strong> and <strong>elevation</strong>, where the subconscious is purified to align with the desires of the conscious mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary of Bethany</strong>: Can symbolise a <strong>more receptive</strong>, <strong>contemplative</strong> state of mind, a readiness to receive divine ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary, the Sister of Lazarus</strong>: Reflects the <strong>resurrection</strong> or <strong>awakening</strong> of the subconscious, symbolising spiritual <strong>rebirth</strong> and the <strong>revelation</strong> of latent creative power.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In Neville’s view, these different Marys represent <strong>various phases</strong> of the subconscious mind's <strong>development</strong>, moving through stages of <strong>cleansing</strong>, <strong>elevation</strong>, and <strong>receptivity</strong>. The transformation of the subconscious mind is <strong>symbolic</strong> of the <strong>spiritual awakening</strong> process, where one moves from a state of <strong>unconsciousness</strong> to one of <strong>creative power</strong>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jesus and Mary Magdalene: The Union of Conscious and Subconscious</strong></h2>
<p>Neville Goddard often emphasised that the Bible’s stories are about the <strong>union of the conscious mind</strong> (Jesus) with the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> (Mary Magdalene). <strong>Jesus' love for Mary Magdalene</strong> is not about romantic affection but about the <strong>alignment of the conscious and subconscious</strong>. For manifestation to occur, the <strong>conscious mind</strong> (Jesus) must plant desires in the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> (Mary Magdalene), which, in turn, nurtures and brings them to life.</p>
<p>This <strong>union</strong> is essential for creation. In Neville’s teachings, the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> is the fertile ground where the <strong>seeds of creation</strong> are planted. Without a <strong>pure, elevated subconscious</strong>, our desires cannot manifest.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion: The Spiritual Journey of Mary Magdalene</strong></h2>
<p>Through Neville Goddard's interpretation, <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> can be seen as a symbol of the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> undergoing a spiritual journey of <strong>purification</strong> and <strong>elevation</strong>. Her <strong>casting out of seven demons</strong> is a metaphor for <strong>cleansing</strong> the subconscious of negative thoughts and limiting beliefs. The <strong>tower</strong> symbolism, connected to her name, suggests a <strong>fortified, elevated mind</strong>, capable of manifesting the creative desires of the conscious mind.</p>
<p>Moreover, the different <strong>Marys</strong> in the New Testament represent various stages of <strong>consciousness</strong>. Each Mary reflects a different aspect of the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>—from its <strong>creation</strong> and <strong>elevation</strong> to its <strong>receptivity</strong> and <strong>resurrection</strong>. Together, they symbolise the <strong>shift in consciousness</strong> required for spiritual awakening and the manifestation of desires.</p>
<p>By aligning the <strong>conscious and subconscious</strong> (as exemplified by the union of Jesus and Mary Magdalene), we unlock the <strong>creative power</strong> within, transforming our <strong>reality</strong>. In this way, the story of Mary Magdalene and the other Marys serves as a <strong>map for spiritual growth</strong>, showing us how to <strong>purify</strong>, <strong>elevate</strong>, and <strong>align</strong> our subconscious mind with the desires of the conscious mind to bring about our desired outcomes.</p>
