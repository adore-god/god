<h1>It’s Not About Men: The Bible Beyond Gender</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>A theory on social media suggests that the Bible’s portrayal of God as <a href="genesis-126-man.html">male</a> stems from ancient male envy of women’s power to give birth. While this idea raises valid questions about gender in religious texts, it misses the deeper symbolic meaning. The Bible is not a document of male dominance—it is a psychological drama, it goes beyond physical being. Tradition treats the Bible as literal history, and this has created the misunderstanding. The bible's consistent use of male characters and pronouns reflects not gender roles, but simply to narrate the <a href="elohim-god.html">movement of consciousness</a> using universal, imaginative and generative symbols .</p><p>According to Neville Goddard, the Bible speaks in the language of symbol and metaphor. The male figure throughout Scripture represents the awakened <em><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></em>—the harnessed power of imagination. This is not about physical masculinity, but about that part of you which assumes, selects, and fixes attention. It is through this inner movement that creation happens—not just once, but always.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Creation Is Within</strong></h3><p>In Genesis, <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> creates <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">by <em>speaking</em>—by imagining</a>. This is not literal speech, but the inner movement of assumption. God imagines the world into being. Neville taught that we do the same: our world reflects our inner conversations, our feelings made flesh.</p><p>The <a href="genesis-126-man.html">“He” pronouns and characters in the Bible </a>aren't there to exclude women—it represents the quality within all of us that imagines and believes something into existence. It symbolises the conscious use of imagination—the moment we choose a state and dwell in it, knowing it to be true.</p><hr/><h3><strong>The Feminine as the Deep</strong></h3><p>If the male characters symbolise the conscious selection of states, the <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">feminine throughout the Bible</a> represents the receptive, fertile deep of the subconscious. <a href="rebekahs-beauty-at-well-flow-of-living.html">Rebekah</a>, <a href="the-seven-devils-cast-out-of-mary.html">Mary</a>, <a href="sarahs-laughter-humour-of-manifestation.html">Sarah</a>—these are not passive women, but images of the creative depths that respond to the seed of assumption.</p><p>And so, every woman holds both powers: the deep receptive womb of the subconscious, and the active voice of God declaring “Let there be.” You are not excluded from creation—you <em>are</em> creation. You bring forth not only life, but worlds, outcomes, transformations.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Giving Birth Without Labour</strong></h3><p>Physical birth is a wonder—but Neville shows us that everyone is constantly giving birth. When you dare to feel yourself <em>already</em> the woman you desire to be—loved, successful, joyful—that inner assumption is your conception. As you persist in that state, life shapes itself around it. This is spiritual pregnancy. This is divine motherhood.</p><p>To imagine boldly, to remain faithful to your assumption even when the facts deny it, is to carry that state to term. Whether woman or man, creation flows from your inner alignment.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Not Patriarchy—Symbolism</strong></h3><p>To say that the Bible is simply men writing a male God out of jealousy is to miss the beauty of the symbols. The Bible doesn’t pit male against female—it weaves them together as aspects of the soul,<a href="genesis-224-love.html"> in the best love story you will ever read</a>. It invites you to read inwardly, to recognise that “He” means the choosing self, the <em>I AM</em>, while “<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">She</a>” represents the deep that receives and brings forth.</p><p>You don’t have to choose between being honoured as a woman and embracing these symbols. You are the whole story. The initiator and the receiver. The Word and the womb.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Neville’s Message for Women</strong></h3><p>Neville Goddard taught that imagination creates reality. He did not place this power in the hands of men alone. He spoke to anyone ready to awaken. The Bible, read symbolically, offers you not a role to play but a power to realise.</p><p>You are not excluded. You are not a side note. You are the field and the seed, the prayer and the fulfilment. You are the one who dares to assume—and so, you are the creator.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Final Thought</strong></h3><p>The Bible’s male imagery is not a denial of feminine power—it is a symbolic portrayal of how the imagination moves. When you understand the symbols, you see that the story is yours. You are not reading a book about men—you are reading a guide to manifestation, hidden in ancient poetry.</p><p>Creation is not gendered. It is spiritual. And it is yours.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
