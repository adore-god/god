<h1>Evolution of Self-Perception </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Genesis 1:26 declares, </p><p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion…”</em> </blockquote><p></p><p>This passage points to every person's creative power — the ability to shape <a href="genesis-126-man.html">reality through imagination and </a>inner states. In Neville Goddard’s teachings, this means each person is a <a href="elohim-god.html">creator, expressing aspects of God through their own consciousness</a>. The biblical characters below symbolise different states we move through in the process of manifestation, reflecting this divine image and dominion.</p><hr/><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abraham: The State of Faith and Surrender</strong></h2><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a> symbolises faith — believing in the unseen. This is the first step in manifestation: trusting that what you desire is already yours, even if you can’t see it yet. Faith in Neville’s teachings is the foundation of all creation.<br>
Additionally, Abraham’s test of sacrificing Isaac (Genesis 22) represents the state of surrender — fully trusting in the divine plan, even when it seems contradictory. In Neville’s framework, this is the point where you let go of attachment to the "how" or the form of manifestation, knowing that what’s meant for you will unfold in its perfect time.<p></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Isaac: The State of Receptivity</strong></h2>
Isaac represents the state of receptivity — being open to receive the desires of the heart. While Abraham took the first step, Isaac is the embodiment of the state where we accept the promise and allow it to manifest, trusting that all is unfolding in divine timing.<p></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jacob: The State of Persistence</strong></h2><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Jacob</a> represents persistence. His struggle with Laban (established limiting beliefs) and the angel shows the need to keep pushing forward despite doubts and obstacles. To manifest, we must stay determined and continue our mental and spiritual work, never giving up on our desires.<p></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Joseph: The State of Imagination</strong></h2><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph</a> embodies imagination — holding onto a vision of success no matter what. Neville teaches that imagination is the creative power of God, and Joseph’s ability to visualise his dreams led to their eventual manifestation, despite external challenges.<p></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Judah</a>: The State of Praise</strong></h2>
Judah represents praise, which is acknowledging that your desire has already been fulfilled. Praise aligns your consciousness with the reality you want to create, speeding up the manifestation process.<p></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Moses: The State of Liberation</strong></h2>
Moses represents liberation — breaking free from limiting beliefs. He leads the Israelites out of Egypt, symbolising how we must free ourselves from mental constraints to manifest our desires, and how the inner journey of liberation is essential to unlocking creation.<p></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>David: The State of Confidence and Action</strong></h2>
David is the embodiment of the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">new self-perception</a>, formed in the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">principal of ask believe and receive</a>. By acting as if the desired result is already achieved, we can overcome any obstacles. Confidence in your imagination allows you to manifest with boldness, just like David’s victory over Goliath.<p></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jesus: The State of Realised Imagination</strong></h2><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> represents the realisation of imagination — fully embodying the power of imagination to manifest. His death and resurrection illustrate how the transformation of consciousness brings the fulfilment of desires. We must let go of the old self and realise the power of our creative imagination.<p></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Paul: The State of Mental Renewal</strong></h2>
Paul symbolises mental renewal — constantly shifting our thoughts to align with the desired outcome. Neville teaches that to manifest, we must renew our mind by focusing only on the desired result and letting go of limiting beliefs.<p></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion: Manifestation through States of Awareness</strong></h2>
These biblical figures show us how to move through different states of awareness to manifest our desires. By embodying faith, receptivity, persistence, imagination, praise, liberation, confidence, realised imagination, and mental renewal, we align with divine power and create our reality.<p></p><div class="share-dropdown">
