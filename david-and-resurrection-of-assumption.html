<h1>"The Lord Said to My Lord": Acts 2:25–36</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In Acts 2, Peter stands before the crowd at Pentecost and declares that Jesus has risen. But his proof comes not through argument, but through Scripture — specifically, the words of David. This is no coincidence.</p><p>According to Neville Goddard, the Bible is not a record of external history, but a psychological drama playing out in the soul of every individual. The characters — David, Jesus, and others — are not people but states of consciousness within you. Acts 2:25–36 is a powerful map of spiritual movement: from belief, to assumption, to resurrection.</p><hr/><h2>David Sees the I AM Always Before Him</h2><p></p><blockquote>“I saw the Lord always before me… my heart was glad… my flesh also shall dwell in hope… you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption.”<br/>
— Acts 2:25–28 (Psalm 16:8–11)</blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
David represents a spiritual attitude — the state of faithful confidence in the unseen. He speaks of the Lord always before him — not someone external, but the inner awareness of “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>.” He is not afraid. He feels joy. His flesh rests in hope. He knows that his assumption will not be lost in the grave of doubt. It will rise.</p><p>In Neville’s words: “Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, and persist in that assumption.”</p><hr/><h2>David Foresaw the Resurrection</h2><p></p><blockquote>“David… both died and was buried… he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades…”<br/>
— Acts 2:29–31</blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
The Psalm David wrote was not about himself but about the Christ — the state of fully realised being. David knew that once an idea is assumed — truly felt and believed — it cannot remain buried. It must rise into experience.</p><p>Christ is not a man. Christ is your awakened imagination, the anointed state of consciousness.</p><p>“The stone you reject,” Neville would say, “is your own wonderful human imagination.”</p><hr/><h2>This Jesus Has Been Raised</h2><p></p><blockquote>“This Jesus God raised up… exalted at the right hand of God… he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.”<br/>
— Acts 2:32–33</blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
The assumed state — Jesus — has been raised. To be seated at the right hand means it has become the dominant power within. Now that the assumption has taken hold, it pours out into visible expression. What was once only felt inwardly is now seen and heard in the world.</p><p>This is the Law of Assumption in action: what you accept as true of yourself becomes external fact.</p><hr/><h2>Sit at My Right Hand</h2><p></p><blockquote>“David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.’”<br/>
— Acts 2:34–35 (Psalm 110:1)</blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
David remains a preparatory state, but he makes way for the higher. The phrase “Sit at my right hand” is not about geography — it is a command to let the assumed identity take its place of power. Rest in the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Stay there — and every condition that once resisted it will be brought into harmony.</p><p>Neville taught: “Dwell in the end, and you will see the bridge of incidents unfold to make it so.”</p><hr/><h2>Made Both Lord and Christ</h2><p></p><blockquote>“Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”<br/>
— Acts 2:36</blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
To be <a href="label-crucifixion-series.html">crucified means to be fixed</a> — to hold firm to your assumption. That which was once nailed in imagination is now risen as Lord (power) and Christ (the anointed identity). It is your own <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> lifted up, ruling your world.</p><p>“The moment you dare to assume it, it is yours. Crucifixion is the fixation of belief. Resurrection is the fulfilment of it.”</p><hr/><h2>Final Summary: States, Not Stories</h2><table>

</table><hr/><h2>Closing Thought</h2><p>Acts 2 is not theology. It’s instruction. You begin like David — in hope, in praise, in assurance. You rise like Jesus — in bold assumption, in fulfilment, in power. The promise is this: what you accept in imagination, you will express in form.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-david-series.html">David Series</a></p>
