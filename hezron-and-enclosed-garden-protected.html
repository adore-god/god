<h1>Hezron and the Shut Up Garden</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p></p><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.”— Song of Solomon 4:12</strong></blockquote><p></p><p></p><div><img alt="Eden Wall Icon The Way" border="0" data-original-height="1403" data-original-width="1903" height="148" src="images/1748442040064.jpg" width="200"/></div>Throughout Scripture, many names appear that, while minor in the overall narrative, symbolise crucial states of consciousness in the process of manifestation. One such name is Hezron. His name and place in the genealogy quietly reveal the necessity of guarding the imagination until it is ready to be expressed and take form.<p></p><h2>Who Is Hezron?</h2><p>Hezron is a <a href="genesis-126-man.html">psychological state</a> that (Hebrew: חֶצְרוֹן, ḥeṣrôn) appears in key genealogies:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Genesis 46:12 – grandson of Judah, son of Perez</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruth 4:18 – part of the lineage to David</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matthew 1:3 – in the genealogy of Jesus</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The root of Hezron’s name (חָצֵר, ḥāṣēr) means “to enclose” or “surround with a wall.” Strong’s Concordance defines it as “enclosed; surrounded by a wall.” Between Judah (praise) and David (the awakened kingly consciousness), Hezron marks the inner condition of enclosure — the imagination protected and held secure.</p><h2>Hezron as the Enclosure of Imagination</h2><p>The Song of Solomon calls the beloved:</p><blockquote>
<p>“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This enclosed garden represents the imagination in its protected state — not exposed to outer contradiction or doubt but held safely within. It mirrors the Garden of Eden, which was guarded after the fall by cherubim with flaming swords, symbolising the protection of the creative power from premature exposure or interference.</p><p>In Neville’s teaching, imagination is the creative power of God. The idea, the desire, must be “enclosed,” guarded by faith — much like the cherubim guard the garden — until it is fully formed in consciousness and ready to manifest. This is the Hezron state: a state of secure inner consciousness where the desire is held faithfully without being forced or tested.</p><h2>The Genealogy of Consciousness</h2><p>Consider the progression:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Judah</strong> — praise, turning consciousness toward the ideal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Perez</strong> — breakthrough, the rupture that allows the new state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hezron</strong> — enclosure, the inner guarded place of imagination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ram</strong> — exalted, rising into higher awareness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Amminadab</strong> — readiness of the inner people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nahshon</strong> — inspired action, divining the way forward</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Salmon</strong> — clothing the inner man, preparing for manifestation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Boaz</strong> — swiftness in securing the thought</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Obed</strong> — serving awareness, obedience to inner vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesse</strong> — gift of abundance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong> — the conscious manifestation, beloved in awareness</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Hezron sits quietly between breakthrough and elevation, the inner sanctuary where imagination is sealed off from outer noise, guarded like the garden by cherubim with swords — the symbol of protecting the sacred creative faculty.</p><h2>The Discipline of Holding Imagination</h2><p>To “enclose” is to guard, not to imprison. The cherubim with flaming swords at Eden’s gate remind us that the imagination, once awakened, must be protected from outer contradiction and doubt until it ripens into manifestation.</p><p>Practically:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Do not verbalise the desire prematurely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not test the seed with doubt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not expose the inner vision to outer facts before its time</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Hezron is the mental state that honours the power of imagination by enclosing and protecting it until it is ready.</p><h2>The Enclosed Garden: Present Delight in Imagination</h2><p>The enclosed garden of the soul is alive and vibrant, but held securely in faith and present consciousness. The “spring shut up, fountain sealed” expresses a present, living delight within imagination — fully alive, but not yet externalised.</p><p>Hezron is this readiness, the quiet yes held within imagination, protected by the cherubim of faith, waiting until the seed is fully formed and ready to appear.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
