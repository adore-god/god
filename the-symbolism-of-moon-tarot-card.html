<h1>The Symbolism of The Moon Tarot Card According to the Law of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The Moon tarot card is a fascinating image that can reveal powerful insights when viewed through the lens of the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>. This law, central to Neville Goddard’s teachings, tells us that whatever we assume to be true, whether consciously or unconsciously, is reflected in our external reality. While the creator of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck may have had different interpretations of the symbolism, we will explore the card’s imagery through Neville Goddard’s framework of manifestation and imagination, purely for interest and insight.</p><h3><strong>The Moon: The Power of Assumption</strong></h3><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, the <strong>Moon</strong> represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, the place where our assumptions are stored. The Moon doesn’t create or make decisions; instead, it reflects the <strong>assumptions</strong> we’ve accepted as true. According to the Law of Assumption, the subconscious mind works to bring into physical reality whatever assumptions we hold to be true.</p><p>Just as the Moon reflects the light of the sun, our assumptions — whether we are aware of them or not — are reflected in our reality. If we assume that we are successful, loved, or worthy, the subconscious will work to manifest those assumptions. But if we carry assumptions of doubt, fear, or limitation, those too will be reflected in our experience.</p><h3><strong>The Dog and the Wolf: Conscious Assumptions and Subconscious Beliefs</strong></h3><p>In the Moon card, the <strong>dog</strong> and the <strong>wolf</strong> stand as symbols of the <strong>conscious mind</strong> (dog) and the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> (wolf). The Law of Assumption teaches us that for manifestation to occur, both these parts of the mind need to align.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>dog</strong> represents the <strong>conscious mind</strong> — the thoughts and assumptions we intentionally focus on. It’s like the part of us that decides what we want, the goals and desires we are aware of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>wolf</strong> represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> — the deeper, habitual beliefs and assumptions that we may not always be aware of, but which strongly influence our reality.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To manifest our desires using the Law of Assumption, we must <strong>align our conscious assumptions</strong> with the subconscious beliefs. If there is a conflict between them — for example, if we consciously want something but subconsciously doubt our worth or ability to receive it — the subconscious mind will ultimately win. Neville emphasised the importance of <strong>assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong> in both conscious and subconscious levels to manifest our desires effectively.</p><h3><strong>The Path: The Journey of Assumption and Manifestation</strong></h3><p>The winding path in the Moon card represents the <strong>journey of assuming</strong> our desires are already fulfilled.</p><p></p><blockquote>“Always <i><b>walk</b></i> in the assumption of the wish fulfilled.” - Neville Goddard </blockquote><p></p><p> Manifestation isn’t an instant process — it’s a journey that begins when we choose to assume the end result, even if everything around us still suggests otherwise. The <strong>fog</strong> that clouds the path represents the <strong>doubts, fears, and assumptions of lack</strong> that can arise during the manifestation process.</p><p>Neville taught that <strong>doubt and fear</strong> are natural parts of the journey, but they should not deter us. The more we persist in our assumption, the clearer the path becomes. Just as fog lifts to reveal the way ahead, our assumptions, once firmly held, will <strong>clear the way</strong> for our desires to materialise.</p><h3><strong>The Crayfish: The First Assumption of Desire</strong></h3><p>At the start of the path, the <strong>crayfish</strong> (or lobster) represents the <strong>first assumption</strong> — the initial spark of an idea or desire that we begin to assume is already true. According to the Law of Assumption, everything begins with a <strong>mental assumption</strong>. When we first assume something, it might feel unfamiliar or even impossible, but by <strong>persistently assuming</strong> that it’s true, we make it real.</p><p>The crayfish shows us that <strong>every manifestation starts with an assumption</strong> — no matter how small it seems. Our reality begins to shift when we start to assume, <strong>“This is already mine,”</strong> rather than waiting for external evidence to prove it to us.</p><h3><strong>The Two Towers as Doorposts: The Gateway Between Assumption and Manifestation</strong></h3><p>The <strong>two towers</strong> in the Moon card represent the <strong>doorposts</strong> between the inner world of imagination and the external world of reality. According to Neville, these towers symbolise the <strong>gateway</strong> between the <strong>assumed state</strong> in our imagination and its physical manifestation.</p><p>The <strong>doorposts</strong> stand as a reminder that in order to manifest anything, we must <strong>pass through the assumption</strong> of it. The more we assume something to be true in our imagination, the more we open the door to it becoming real in the external world. This is a crucial step in the Law of Assumption: we must assume the reality we desire with unwavering belief before it can appear in our world.</p><h3><strong>The Towers in the Mountainscape: Elevating Our Consciousness to Match Our Assumptions</strong></h3><p>The towers stand in a <strong>mountainscape</strong>, which represents <strong>elevated consciousness</strong> or the <strong>higher state of awareness</strong> necessary for manifestation. In the Law of Assumption, we learn that in order to manifest our desires, we must <strong>elevate our consciousness</strong> and accept our assumption as true, regardless of current circumstances.</p><p>The <strong>mountain</strong> symbolizes <strong>spiritual elevation</strong> — the shift in our thinking that occurs when we begin to truly assume that our desires are already fulfilled. The higher the mountain, the greater the <strong>consciousness</strong> we need to match our assumptions with the reality we want to create. Neville taught that <strong>manifestation is a matter of consciousness</strong>: once we assume we are the person we want to be, the world must reflect that assumption.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Power of Assumption in Manifestation</strong></h3><p>In Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption, the <strong>Moon tarot card</strong> offers a rich visual of how our assumptions shape our reality. The two towers represent the <strong>gateway</strong> between our inner assumptions and external manifestation, while the mountainscape calls us to <strong>elevate our consciousness</strong> to match the assumptions we hold. The dog and wolf remind us that both our conscious thoughts and subconscious beliefs must be aligned for manifestation to happen.</p><p>The <strong>winding path</strong> represents the process of assuming our desires are already true, even in the face of uncertainty. The <strong>fog</strong> is the doubt we encounter along the way, but with persistence, the path becomes clear. The <strong>crayfish</strong> is the first spark of desire, showing us that everything starts with an assumption.</p><p>By living in the assumption that our desires are already true — feeling it, believing it, and living it — we <strong>open the door</strong> to the physical manifestation of those desires. The Law of Assumption teaches that we are the creators of our reality, and the Moon card illustrates how we can use the power of assumption to bring our desires into the world.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
