<h2>In This Psychological Framework</h2>
<p>In this psychological framework, a tax collector represents a state of consciousness defined by internal lack and the pursuit of external validation. Instead of operating as a unified "Shepherd" who knows their inherent value, the tax collector is a fragmented identity that believes it must "extract" worth, security, or identity from the world around it—a <a href="https://god.thway.uk/genesis-47-sin.html">"jurisdictional error" where the individual identifies as a debtor to their circumstances</a>. However, when the governing I AM (the <a href="https://god.thway.uk/jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a> archetype) sits and eats with these tax collectors, it signifies the  improved identity entering into those fragmented, anxious parts of the mind to bring them into alignment. Rather than judging the state of "not enough" as permanent, this higher identity "consumes" the old belief in debt, revising the filing in the internal courtroom. By sitting at this table, the "Shepherd" gathers the wandering voices of insufficiency and transforms the seeker of external gain into a "Disciple"—a disciplined, singular focus on the reality of being already whole.</p>
<p>This dynamic closely mirrors the story of <a href="https://god.thway.uk/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph</a> and his brothers. Joseph represents provision already prepared, yet his brothers initially refuse to accept what is freely given because their perception is shaped by guilt, fear, and a fragmented sense of identity. In the same way, the tax collector state cannot recognise abundance because it is still operating from internal deficit. When higher awareness “sits at the table,” it is akin to Joseph revealing himself—provision was never absent; it was resisted by the old narrative. The reconciliation is not external supply appearing, but internal resistance dissolving.</p>

<h2>The Internal Courtroom: The Tax Collector’s Audit</h2>
<p>Ever feel like you’re constantly "checking the books" of your life and finding a deficit? In the Linguistic Engine of consciousness, the Tax Collector isn't a person—it's a state of mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> It is the "False Filing" of the soul. When you identify as someone who needs to collect (love, money, or status) from the outside, you are telling your internal Judges (Elohim) that you are currently bankrupt.</li>
<li><strong>The Jurisdiction:</strong> Because you’ve assumed the identity of "The Taker," the laws of your reality must enforce a life of constant extraction and hidden debt. You are stuck in the "Pit," trying to tax a world that can never fill an internal void.</li>
<li><strong>The Solution:</strong> Notice who "sits at the table" with the tax collector. It is the unified I AM. This represents your highest awareness entering your lowest thoughts of lack.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Reversal: You don't get rid of the tax collector; you transform the "name" (the nature) of that state. You stop "taxing" your environment for validation and start "gathering" your fragmented thoughts into the One Fold of a complete identity.</p>
<p>Stop filing for bankruptcy in the courtroom of your mind. Sit at the table with your higher self and realise the "debt" was always an illusion of the old identity.</p>
