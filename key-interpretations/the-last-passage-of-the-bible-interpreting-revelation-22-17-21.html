        <h2>The Invitation to Union (Cleaving)</h2>
        <p>Revelation 22:17 — "And the Spirit and the bride say, 'Come!' And let him who hears say, 'Come!' And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Spirit and the Bride:</strong> This represents the Shepherd / Unified Identity (Thread 4). The "Spirit" is the active YHVH/LORD (Present Consciousness) and the <a href="../genesis-224-love.html">"Bride" is the Ehyeh/I AM (Assumed Identity)</a>. They are no longer separate; they are calling for total Union (Thread 3).</li>
            <li><strong>The Invitation:</strong> "Come" is the mechanical call for the fragmented "sheep" (scattered thoughts/voices) to enter the One Fold.</li>
            <li><strong>The Water of Life:</strong> This is the <a href="../genesis-111-seed.html">Seed/Wine (Thread 1)</a>. To "take freely" means there is no "Jurisdictional Error" (Sin) required for entry. You simply assume the identity (I AM) and the life-force flows because Elohim enforces the nature of the state you occupy.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Statutes of the Court (Plurality &amp; Sin)</h2>
        <p>Revelation 22:18–19 — "For I testify to everyone who hears... If anyone adds to these things... if anyone takes away from the words of the book..."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adding/Taking Away:</strong> In this engine, this is the definition of <a href="../genesis-47-sin.html">Sin (Thread 7: The Jurisdictional Error)</a>.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Adding:</strong> Trying to bring "Old Father’s House" (limiting beliefs) into the new I AM.</li>
                    <li><strong>Taking Away:</strong> Denying the power of the Ehyeh/I AM while claiming the name of YHVH/LORD.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Penalty:</strong> If the "filing" is corrupted by adding or subtracting, Elohim (The Judges &amp; Rulers) must legally enforce a corrupted reality. The "plagues" are simply the mechanical feedback of a False Filing—if you assume a fragmented identity, you experience a fragmented life.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Final Verdict (Surely)</h2>
        <p>Revelation 22:20 — "He who testifies to these things says, 'Surely I am coming quickly.' Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!"</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Surely:</strong> This is not a hope, but a Judicial Decree. It is the sound of the gavel.</li>
            <li><strong>Quickly:</strong> The removal of the "Goats" (rebellious fragments) means there is no resistance in consciousness. Manifestation is instantaneous.</li>
            <li><strong>Lord Jesus:</strong> YHVH/LORD (The Petitioner) fully merging with <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">the nature of Salvation/Deliverance (The Name)</a>. The "Marriage" is complete.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Final State (The Kingdom)</h2>
        <p>Revelation 22:21 — "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grace:</strong> This is the operational state where Elohim is no longer seen as a "stern judge" but as the perfect Enclosure (The Fold).</li>
            <li><strong>With You All:</strong> The "Twelve Disciples" (the plurality of your internal voices) are now in total alignment under the one Ehyeh/I AM.</li>
            <li><strong>Amen:</strong> The Linguistic Engine has finished its cycle. The identity has moved from the Seed (Genesis) to the City/Kingdom (Revelation). The case is closed.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Summary of the End</h2>
        <p>The end of Revelation is the Mechanical Shutdown of the Old Self. It describes a consciousness that has successfully "Left" the familiar states of lack and "Cleaved" to a unified identity of "Life." Because the Courtroom (Elohim) finds no contradiction in your "I AM," it grants the "Water of Life" without delay. It is the transition from Petitioner to Ruler.</p>
