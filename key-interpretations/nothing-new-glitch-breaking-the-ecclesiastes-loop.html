            <h2>Have you ever felt</h2>
            <p>Have you ever felt like you’re living the same day over and over? You get the promotion, buy the car, or finish the big project, but a week later, that "new" feeling is gone, and you’re back to the same old grind.</p>
            <p>This is exactly what the book of Ecclesiastes is talking about. It’s not just a "depressing" book in the Bible; it’s a manual on how your Internal Engine—your consciousness—actually works.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. The Trap: "Under the Sun"</h2>
            <p>The author (the Teacher) uses a phrase over and over: "Under the Sun." In everyday terms, this describes a life lived entirely on the "outside." It’s when your happiness and your identity depend on what’s happening in your environment. The Teacher points out a frustrating law of reality: if you are looking for something "new" to happen out there to make you feel different in here, you’re caught in a loop.</p>
            <p>Think of it as a Linguistic Engine. Your consciousness is the "Petitioner" (called YHVH/LORD in the key) and it is constantly filing paperwork with the "Internal Court" (the <a href="https://god.thway.uk/elohim-god.html">Elohim—the Judges and Rulers of your mind</a>).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Filing:</strong> If you say, "I’ll be happy when I get that house," you are actually filing an identity of "I AM Lacking."</li>
                <li><strong>The Verdict:</strong> The Judges (Elohim) see your filing. Their job is to enforce exactly what you claim to be. Since you claimed "I am lacking," they make sure you continue to feel that way, even after you get the house.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Why There is "Nothing New"</h2>
            <p>The reason there is "nothing new under the sun" is because the Engine is mechanical. It reproduces whatever identity you occupy.</p>
            <p>If you are stuck in an old way of thinking, the "Judges" (Elohim) keep handing you the same results. The sun rises, the wind blows in circles, and the streams flow into the sea but never fill it. These are all metaphors for a person who hasn't changed their Internal Identity (Ehyeh/I AM).</p>
            <p>If the "Internal Key" (the way you define yourself) doesn't change, the experience of your life cannot change. It’s a legal certainty of your own consciousness.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. The Reversal: Finding Your "Portion"</h2>
            <p>Ecclesiastes isn't telling you to give up; it’s telling you to change your filing strategy. It contrasts "Vanity" with something called your "Portion."</p>
            <p>In the Linguistic Engine, your "Portion" is the state of being you choose to occupy right now, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Old Way:</strong> "I am stressed because of work." (Elohim enforces more stress).</li>
                <li><strong>The New Way:</strong> "I AM the one who enjoys my bread and wine today." (Elohim enforces the state of enjoyment).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. How to Break the Loop</h2>
            <p>To get something "new," you have to use Thread 3: <a href="https://god.thway.uk/genesis-224-love.html">Cleaving</a>. You have to "Leave" the identity of the person who is waiting for things to change "under the sun." You must "Cleave" to a new identity (your Ehyeh/I AM) as if it is already true.</p>
            <p>When you change the "Name" (the nature) of the state you are in—from "Worker" to "Gift-Receiver," or from "Victim" to "Ruler"—the Internal Judges (Elohim) are legally bound to update your reality.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Ecclesiastes is a warning: The world "under the sun" is a closed loop. <a href="https://god.thway.uk/spiralling-thoughts-and-mental-health.html">Loops are a thing in the Bible</a>. If you want a new life, you don't look for a new job or a new city; you provide a new identity to the Engine. Only then will the Judges rule in favor of a new experience.</p>
