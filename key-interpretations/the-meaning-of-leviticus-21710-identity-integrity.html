<h2>This passage is not about external clergy, ritual purity, or ancient law.</h2>
<p>This passage is not about external clergy, ritual purity, or ancient law.</p>
<p>It is a description of what happens inside your own mind when you <a href="../genesis-126-man.html">assume an identity</a>.</p>
<p>Every character in the text represents a function of consciousness:</p>
<ul>
<li>YHVH/LORD = your present awareness.</li>
<li>Ehyeh / I AM = the identity you are choosing to occupy.</li>
<li><a href="../elohim-god.html">Elohim</a> = your internal governing structure — the mental laws, stabilising forces, and automatic enforcement system that outpictures whatever identity you sustain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing here is external.</p>
<p>This is a psychological instruction manual.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Priest = Your Governing Awareness</h2>
<p>The “priest” represents the part of you that consciously chooses an identity.</p>
<p>When you say internally, “I am this,” that is priestly function.</p>
<p>Leviticus 21:7–10 is explaining what must happen inside your own mind if that identity is to stabilise and manifest.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Do Not Take a Harlot — Do Not Cleave to Fragmented States</h2>
<p>A <a href="../genesis-224-love.html">wife symbolises the state you cleave to</a> — the identity you sustain.</p>
<p>A harlot represents fragmentation — entertaining multiple identities at once.</p>
<p>Inside your mind, this looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I AM secure” … but also rehearsing insecurity.</li>
<li>“I AM chosen” … but internally expecting rejection.</li>
<li>“I AM abundant” … but emotionally cleaving to lack.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is double-filing in the courtroom of consciousness.</p>
<p>Elohim — your internal enforcement system — cannot stabilise contradiction. It must enforce whatever state is dominantly sustained.</p>
<p>This instruction is about mental exclusivity.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>He Is Holy — Set Apart in the Mind</h2>
<p>Holy means <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">set apart</a>.</p>
<p>Inside the reader, this means:</p>
<p>Once you assume an identity, you stop treating it as temporary, experimental, or optional.</p>
<p>You do not casually step in and out of it.</p>
<p>You do not rehearse the opposite.</p>
<p>You leave the old state and cleave to the new one.</p>
<p>This is sustained identity — not emotional fluctuation.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>If the Daughter Profanes Herself — Your Results Reveal Your Filing</h2>
<p>The daughter represents what is produced from your assumed identity — your reactions, patterns, and eventually circumstances.</p>
<p>If you claim an identity internally but your reactions contradict it, the fruit exposes the inconsistency.</p>
<p>Your internal government (Elohim) enforces coherence.</p>
<p>If your dominant inner state is fear, it will enforce fear.</p>
<p>If it is authority, it will enforce authority.</p>
<p>If it is contradiction, it will enforce instability.</p>
<p>The system is mechanical, not moral.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The High Priest — Your Dominant I AM</h2>
<p>The high priest represents your highest governing assumption — the identity that rules over all other internal voices.</p>
<p>He is “anointed” — consciously chosen and stabilised.</p>
<p>He must not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncover his head (lose governing thought)</li>
<li>Rend his garments (tear the visible form of identity)</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside your mind this means:</p>
<p>Once you assume an identity, you do not emotionally collapse when circumstances test it.</p>
<p>If you tear the identity internally, Elohim must enforce the tear.</p>
<p>If you remain internally coherent, Elohim enforces coherence.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What This Ultimately Means</h2>
<p>Leviticus 21:7–10 is describing identity integrity inside the reader.</p>
<p>It is teaching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not assume an identity and then mentally contradict it.</li>
<li>Do not cleave to multiple self-definitions.</li>
<li>Do not destabilise your ruling I AM when challenged.</li>
<li>Do not expect enforcement of an identity you are not internally faithful to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything happens within the structure of your own consciousness.</p>
<p>YHVH/LORD = your present awareness.</p>
<p>Ehyeh / I AM = the identity you are assuming.</p>
<p>Elohim = the automatic enforcement system of your mind.</p>
<p>There is no external priesthood here.</p>
<p>You are the priest.</p>
<p>You are the one who assumes.</p>
<p>You are the one whose internal government enforces what you sustain.</p>
<p>Leviticus is describing the mechanics of psychological coherence — and the consequences of fragmentation — inside the reader’s own mind.</p>
