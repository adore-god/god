<section>
  <h2>Author Background</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>HNNH</strong> is a researcher and writer focused on the 
    <strong>psychological and analytical study</strong> of Scripture. 
    Drawing from the interpretive framework uncovered by Neville Goddard, HNNH explores biblical 
    narratives not as historical events, but as a <strong>symbolic and psychological map</strong> 
    of human consciousness and the creative function of imagination embedded within the text itself.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A Rational Approach (Non-Traditional)</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike <strong>traditional theology</strong> or religious dogma, HNNH’s work 
    approaches the Bible from a <strong>rational, psychological standpoint</strong>. 
    The focus is on the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>—the principle that the 
    "God" of Scripture personifies the governing imagination and its regulatory role in shaping experience. 
    This is an analytical study of inner mental processes in the context of fulfilment, 
    not a religious or denominational interpretation.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Reading the Bible Inwardly</h2>
<p> 
HNNH observes that many read the Bible as literal history or theology, which often fragments the mind and obscures its original design. Read inwardly, however, through assumed identity (I AM) and internal governance (Elohim), the text reveals a cohesive narrative that teaches to look beyond appearances and cultivate inner awareness.
</p> 
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Commitment to Clarity</h2>
  <p>
    HNNH is dedicated to presenting Neville Goddard’s insights with precision and intellectual care, 
    emphasising that his work sought to uncover the Bible’s internal psychological narrative rather than establish new theology. 
    By focusing on <strong>inner mechanics</strong> rather than outward ritual, this research 
    provides a grounded and coherent resource for those exploring the relationship between thought, identity, and fulfilment.
