<section>
  <h2>Author Background</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>HNNH</strong> is a researcher and writer focused on the 
    <strong>psychological and analytical study</strong> of Scripture. 
    Drawing deeply from the teachings of Neville Goddard, HNNH explores biblical 
    narratives not as historical events, but as a <strong>mental roadmap</strong> 
    of human consciousness and the creative power of imagination.
  </p>

  <h2>A Rational Approach (Non-Traditional)</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike <strong>traditional theology</strong> or religious dogma, HNNH’s work 
    approaches the Bible from a <strong>rational, psychological stance</strong>. 
    The focus is on the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>—the understanding that 
    the "God" of scripture is a personification of the human imagination as the Judges and Rulers of Self. 
    This is an analytical study of mind-mechanics, not a religious or 
    denominational interpretation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Commitment to Clarity</h2>
  <p>
    HNNH is dedicated to preserving the integrity of Neville’s insights while 
    maintaining a high standard of interpretive care. By focusing on 
    <strong>inner mechanics</strong> rather than outward ritual, this work 
    provides a grounded, trustworthy resource for those exploring the 
    intersection of thought and manifestation.
