<h1>Luke 5:21–39 — The Healing Law of Assumption in Action</h1>
<p>The fifth chapter of Luke is rich with meaning when read psychologically, as Neville Goddard encouraged. It isn’t a series of historical miracles or religious doctrines; it’s a coded revelation of how consciousness moves, how identity shifts, and how assumption governs manifestation.</p>
<p>Each section unfolds a deeper principle of how transformation happens—not in the outer world first, but in the inner landscape of belief and awareness. Let’s explore Luke 5:21–39 through the Law of Assumption, seeing each movement as an interior event.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Verses 21–26: Healing the Paralysed Man</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Assumption Overrides Limitation</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</em><br/>
<em>“Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paralysed man represents a state of consciousness stuck in immobility—unable to move forward because the self-concept has crystallised into helplessness. The religious scribes respond in outrage because Jesus (symbol of the awakened imagination) dares to <em>forgive sins</em>—in other words, <strong>to overwrite the past assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>To forgive is to let go of an old state. The words “Get up and walk” symbolise the act of assuming a new condition and allowing the body or life to conform.</p>
<p>Neville taught that sin means “to miss the mark.” And missing the mark is nothing more than <strong>persisting in the wrong assumption</strong>. This moment in scripture reveals that changing the inner man—through assumption—is the true healing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Imagination does not fix; it replaces. It forgives by abandoning the old identity and stepping fully into the new.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Verses 27–32: The Calling of Levi</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Assumption Transcends Identity</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Follow me,” Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Levi, the tax collector, is not merely a man in a booth. He is a mental structure: an individual locked into a socially accepted, limiting role. The moment Jesus calls him, Levi <em>leaves everything</em>. This is not a moral act of discipleship, but a <strong>psychological event</strong>—a radical abandonment of the former self.</p>
<p>In the Law of Assumption, this represents the moment you drop every mental tether to who you’ve been, and you begin to walk in a new state. Levi does not reform his role; he walks away from it altogether. That is the power of assumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The self you assume is not a better version of who you were—it is a different state entirely.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Verses 33–35: Question About Fasting</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Assumption Requires Joy, Not Denial</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crowd asks why Jesus’ disciples do not fast. Fasting here symbolises self-denial, the belief that spiritual power must be earned through suffering, withdrawal, or ascetic effort.</p>
<p>But Jesus offers a subtle rebuke: <strong>why mourn when the </strong><a href="label-bride---bridegroom-series.html">bridegroom</a><strong> is present?</strong> The bridegroom is the union of imagination (the I AM) with the desire fulfilled. In that union, there is no absence—only presence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>True assumption is not striving; it is celebration.</strong><br/>
When you truly feel that what you desire is already yours, there is no place for mourning. Fasting becomes obsolete because there is nothing lacking.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Verses 36–39: New Garments and New Wine</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Assumption Demands Total Renewal</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“No one tears a piece from a new garment to patch an old one.”</em><br/>
<em>“No one pours new wine into old wineskins.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These parables speak directly to the heart of Neville’s teachings. The <strong>new garment</strong> is your new concept of self. The <strong>new wine</strong> is the emotional conviction of being something different. The <strong>old skins</strong> and <strong>old fabric</strong> are your prior assumptions, beliefs, and identity.</p>
<p>Trying to mix the two—trying to hold onto remnants of your old identity while assuming a new one—causes rupture. You cannot patch the new onto the old. You must <strong>become entirely new</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Assumption is not about affirming over doubt—it is the quiet death of the former self.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus is warning here, as Neville often did, that you cannot step into a new state while secretly hoping to preserve pieces of the old. The Law demands total psychological fidelity.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: A Living Blueprint for Transformation</strong></h2>
<p>This passage from Luke is not a cluster of disconnected stories. It is an unfolding sequence, showing how consciousness shifts through assumption:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The paralysed man</strong> shows the release of limitation through a new belief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Levi’s calling</strong> shows the courage to leave an old identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The question about fasting</strong> reveals that fulfilment comes not from deprivation, but presence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The parables of wine and garments</strong> make it clear: transformation is total. There is no halfway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that “consciousness is the only reality.” Luke 5:21–39 is a living example of that truth in motion. When you assume a new state, the world rearranges itself to reflect it—not because it must be convinced, but because <strong>it is your own reflection.</strong></p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-healing-series.html">Healing Series</a> | <a href="label-luke-series.html">Luke Series</a></p>
