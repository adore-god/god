<h1>The Myrtle Flower: Neville Goddard Style</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In the Bible, Esther is known for her courage and faith in saving the Jewish people. But there's more to her story when we consider her original name, <strong>Hadassah</strong>, which means <strong>myrtle</strong> in Hebrew. The <strong>myrtle flower</strong> carries deep symbolism that ties into Neville Goddard’s teachings on manifestation, imagination, spiritual renewal, and the power of the subconscious mind.</p>
<h3>The Myrtle: A Symbol of Renewal and Beauty</h3>
<p>The <strong>myrtle tree</strong> is evergreen, symbolizing <strong>spiritual renewal</strong>, <strong>beauty</strong>, and <strong>immortality</strong>. Its fragrant blossoms represent <strong>inner strength</strong> that can flourish even in difficult conditions. Just like the myrtle, Esther’s inner beauty and strength led to her transformation, showing us how we can manifest our desires when we align with our true selves.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard often spoke about the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> as the <strong>womb</strong>—the place where our desires are conceived and nurtured before being birthed into our reality. Just as a seed planted in the womb of the earth grows and eventually emerges into a physical form, our desires, when planted in the subconscious mind, begin to grow and manifest in our lives. The <strong>myrtle</strong> symbolizes this process of renewal and growth, much like the transformation that Esther undergoes in her story.</p>
<h3>Esther and the Myrtle: Manifesting Change</h3>
<p>Esther’s rise to queen symbolizes the <strong>creative imagination</strong> we all possess. Neville Goddard teaches that our <strong>imagination</strong> shapes our reality. Esther’s courage and faith mirror the <strong>power of imagination</strong>—when we trust in our inner power, we can manifest the life we desire, just as Esther used her position to influence the king.</p>
<p>In line with Neville's philosophy, the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> is where Esther’s courage and confidence were cultivated, much like the myrtle seed growing in the earth before it bursts into life. Esther’s actions reflect the power of <strong>belief</strong> and <strong>imagination</strong> to create reality, as she steps into her own power to make the impossible possible.</p>
<p>Esther 4:14 captures the call to action that mirrors our own potential for change:<br/>
<em>"For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place; but you and your father’s house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"</em><br/>
This verse reflects the <strong>timing</strong> and <strong>purpose</strong> that can lead to transformation—much like how we can choose to act on our desires and manifest the changes we seek by nourishing them in our subconscious mind.</p>
<h3>Esther's Inner Power and Faith</h3>
<p>In Esther 5:1-2, we see Esther stepping into her power with confidence:<br/>
<em>"Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, across from the king's house, while the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, facing the entrance of the house. So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, that she found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter."</em><br/>
This moment symbolizes Esther's courage to step into her <strong>royal identity</strong>—her creative power. Just as Neville teaches us to <strong>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>, Esther's bold actions reflect this principle. She imagined herself already favored and acted as though her desire had already been realized, and in doing so, she was granted the favor she envisioned.</p>
<h3>Myrtle’s Fragrance: The Power of Faith and Imagination</h3>
<p>The <strong>fragrance of the myrtle</strong> represents the <strong>vibrational energy</strong> we emit when we imagine our desires with belief and feeling. Like the sweet fragrance that spreads, our <strong>positive thoughts and faith</strong> influence our reality, creating the circumstances we envision. This ties into Neville's teaching that what we <strong>believe</strong> and <strong>imagine</strong> with feeling is what we bring into existence. The <strong>subconscious</strong> absorbs these beliefs, and just as the fragrance of the myrtle spreads, our energy influences our external world.</p>
<p>In Esther 7:3, we see her again aligning with her inner power and trusting the manifestation process:<br/>
<em>"Then Queen Esther answered and said, 'If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.'"</em><br/>
Esther confidently <strong>imagines her request granted</strong>, knowing that the king will listen. This mirrors Neville’s teaching about having faith in the unseen, that when we <strong>believe in our desires</strong> with feeling, we align with the flow of our reality.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Embracing the Myrtle Within</h3>
<p>The <strong>myrtle flower</strong> is a reminder that, like Esther, we have the <strong>power to manifest and transform</strong>. By nurturing our desires in the <strong>womb of the subconscious mind</strong> and aligning our thoughts with faith, we can <strong>renew</strong> our lives, just as the myrtle tree remains evergreen. Esther’s story, rooted in the power of the <strong>myrtle</strong>, teaches us that we too can step into our creative power, cultivate our inner beliefs, and manifest the life we desire by planting the seeds in the fertile ground of the subconscious.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
