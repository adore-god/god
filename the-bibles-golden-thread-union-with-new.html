<h1>The Bible’s Golden Thread: Union with the New Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>If the Bible teaches anything repeatedly, it is this: <strong>you must join yourself—<a href="genesis-224-love.html">cleave</a>—and '<a href="the-nails-and-name-crucifixion-yhvh-and.html">fixate</a>' to the new state of being</strong>. Over and over, through symbols, poetry, law, and ritual, the message is clear: your transformation begins when you <strong>commit in love to your chosen assumption</strong>, allowing no separation between it and yourself.</p><p>This is the entire <a href="genesis-224-love.html">spiritual structure hidden in Genesis 2:24</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”<br>
—Genesis 2:24</p>
</blockquote><p>This is not about two people—it is about <strong>you</strong>. The “<a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>” is the <a href="elohim-god.html">conscious awareness</a>. The “wife” and <a href="the-bride-and-bridegroom-sacred-union.html">bride</a> is the state desired. <strong>To cleave is to cling with full attachment, to refuse to be divided from the new identity.</strong> Marriage in Scripture is always symbolic: it represents the joining of your awareness <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">(I AM)</a> with your assumption, through fidelity, love, and inward commitment. It is not passive acceptance—it is conscious union.</p><p>The entire tribe of <em><a href="levi-levites-aaron-and-jesus-symbolism.html">Levi</a></em>, whose name means “joined,” was set apart for sacred service. They represent the aspect of you that commits. Joining is not mechanical—it is priestly. It is the mind preparing itself to enter the holy place of assumption with reverence and focus. <strong>You become what you join to</strong>, and your inner Levite must lead this act of sacred union.</p><p>This is what the rituals of <a href="scrolls/label-priesthood-series.html" class="noTag">Moses and Aaron</a> symbolised. The washing, the anointing, the garments, the blood—<strong>all represent purification of the old identity</strong> and readiness for marriage to the new. These rites were never about God needing offerings. They symbolise the mental and emotional cleansing required to move from the outer world to the inner altar—<strong>where you cleave to the new state in quiet conviction</strong>.</p><p>And the final image is the cross.</p><p><strong>Jesus is crucified at Golgotha—the place of the skull—because this union happens in the mind.</strong> He is the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> joined to the assumption of resurrection, nailed in place no matter what the world says. The mockers, the thorns, the piercing—they are all psychological symbols of what happens when you dare to remain faithful to the unseen. But the crucifixion is not tragedy—it is triumph: <strong>the assumption held firm until it becomes flesh</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Be still and know that <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> God.”<br>
—Psalm 46:10</p>
</blockquote><p>Every story in the Bible is the movement of your own mind. Every character is a symbolic function of consciousness attempting union with the truth of being. The aim is not moral performance or historical remembrance—it is the marriage of awareness and assumption. <strong>It is the union of God and man within you.</strong></p><p>So the process repeats again and again:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Leave the old identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleave to the new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Join yourself to it in love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare your inner altar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nail the assumption in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rise as the fulfilment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the law beneath all the symbols.<br>
<strong>Join yourself to what you seek. Let it be your only beloved.</strong></p><p>That is the cleaving.<br>
That is the covenant.<br>
That is the resurrection.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-24-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 2:24 Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-introductory-series.html" class="noTag">Introductory Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-priesthood-series.html" class="noTag">Priesthood Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-yhvh-series.html" class="noTag">YHVH Series</a></p>
