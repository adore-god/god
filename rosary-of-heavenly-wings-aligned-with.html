<h1>Rosary of Heavenly Wings: Aligned with the Power of Desire and Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>C<em>urated to embody softness, receptivity, and the quiet confidence of assumption.</em></p><p>
<strong>Theme: Wings and Angels – Feminine, Desire-Based, BBE Version</strong></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Opening (Introductory Invocation)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>At the Cross: Identity</strong><br/>
<em>“I made you and gave you strength, and I will be your helper.” — Isaiah 41:10</em></p>
<p>I am held aloft in the embrace of the Invisible. My name is whispered on wings unseen. I am what I am—resting in the assurance that I do not carry myself. I am carried.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>First Bead: Receiving</strong></h3>
<p><em>“Are they not all spirits who take news, sent out to be servants to those whose heritage will be salvation?” — Hebrews 1:14</em></p>
<p>I receive what is mine by divine message and ministering grace. All that is mine comes to me with wings. The messengers are already dispatched.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Next Three Beads (Prepare the Soil)</strong></h3>
<p><em>“He will give you the wings of a dove covered with silver, its feathers shining with gold.” — Psalm 68:13</em><br/>
<em>“You have been kept safe under the wings of the Most High.” — Psalm 91:4</em><br/>
<em>“Let the word of Christ be in you in all wisdom.” — Colossians 3:16</em></p>
<p>I am a garden enclosed, kissed by winged revelation. I prepare the soil of my heart with softness, stillness, and song.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Before First Decade (Set the Mood)</strong></h3>
<p><em>“He will give his angels orders about you, to keep you in all your ways.” — Psalm 91:11</em></p>
<p>The air around me is thick with wings. I walk in the softness of divine supervision. My ways are not watched—they are witnessed. I am held and seen.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Five Decades: The Soft Power of Desire</strong></h2>
<p>Each decade includes a central verse (<em>Desire Declaration</em>) and ten affirming verses (<em>Petals</em>), drawing out the feminine themes of receptivity, faith, incubation, and fulfilment.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Decade 1: I Am Carried on Wings</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Desire Declaration:</strong><br/>
<em>“You have seen what I did... how I took you on eagle’s wings and took you to myself.” — Exodus 19:4</em></p>
<p><strong>Petal (Repeat 10 times):</strong><br/>
<em>“He will keep you from falling, and will lift you up with joy.” — Jude 1:24</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Decade 2: I Am the Message Fulfilled</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Desire Declaration:</strong><br/>
<em>“The word which goes out of my mouth will not come back to me without effect.” — Isaiah 55:11</em></p>
<p><strong>Petal (Repeat 10 times):</strong><br/>
<em>“Blessed is the woman who believed what the Lord said to her would be done.” — Luke 1:45</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Decade 3: I Am Under the Shadow of Wings</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Desire Declaration:</strong><br/>
<em>“Let me be safe under the shade of your wings.” — Psalm 17:8</em></p>
<p><strong>Petal (Repeat 10 times):</strong><br/>
<em>“The Lord will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will be safe.” — Psalm 91:4</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Decade 4: I Am the Open Heaven</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Desire Declaration:</strong><br/>
<em>“I saw heaven opening, and a ladder reaching to the earth, with angels going up and down on it.” — Genesis 28:12</em></p>
<p><strong>Petal (Repeat 10 times):</strong><br/>
<em>“The angels of God are always before the face of the Father.” — Matthew 18:10</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Decade 5: I Am Lifted and Sent</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Desire Declaration:</strong><br/>
<em>“Then the spirit took me up, and I heard the sound of great wings.” — Ezekiel 3:12</em></p>
<p><strong>Petal (Repeat 10 times):</strong><br/>
<em>“Go in peace; the desire of your heart is granted to you.” — 1 Samuel 1:17</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Closing Benediction: The Quiet Flowering of the Wish</strong></h3>
<p><em>“He will give his angels orders to take care of you.” — Luke 4:10</em><br/>
<em>“Let my prayer come before you like sweet perfume, and the lifting up of my hands like the evening offering.” — Psalm 141:2</em><br/>
<em>“He has put a new song in my mouth.” — Psalm 40:3</em></p>
<p>My prayer does not rise—<em>it is already risen</em>. I do not wait to be lifted—I am the lifting. Desire has wings, and I rest beneath them.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
