<h1>Donald Trump: The Beast</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Neville Goddard’s interpretation, the Bible serves as a symbolic map of consciousness, unveiling the inner workings of the human mind through the stories of its characters. When we apply this lens to <a href="genesis-126-man.html">Donald Trump’s</a> presidency, we can observe how his actions and rhetoric closely mirror figures from the Bible—particularly <strong>Cain</strong>, <strong>King Saul</strong>, and even the <strong>Beast</strong>. Each of these biblical figures represents different states of mind and levels of consciousness, offering a fascinating perspective on Trump’s leadership. His presidency, characterised by defiance, ego-driven actions, and frequent chaos, provides a striking parallel to the struggles of these figures within the broader context of the Bible.</p>
<h2><strong>Cain: The Outer Man and the Struggle with the Inner Will</strong></h2>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, <strong>Cain</strong> symbolises the <strong>outer man</strong>—the part of us <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">driven by surface-level desires, ego, and external validation</a>. Cain’s story represents the inner conflict between the deeper, imaginative forces (represented by Abel) and the outward-driven forces of the ego. His jealousy, frustration, and <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">ultimate violence</a> stem from his inability to align with his inner creative potential, leading to destructive consequences.</p>
<p>Trump’s behaviour often mirrored this Cain-like ego struggle. His leadership seemed rooted in a need to prove himself externally, whether through personal success or political dominance. Much like Cain’s sacrifice being rejected, Trump’s repeated efforts to assert control seemed misaligned with the deeper, more harmonious flow of truth. His presidency was marked by an almost compulsive need to dominate, which often led to alienation, as Cain’s actions did. The outcome of Cain’s story—being cast into a state of wandering—could also symbolise the isolation that frequently accompanied Trump’s time in office, as his decisions seemed more reactive than driven by an internally unified vision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Cain’s story is a mirror of the outer man’s struggle for control, a constant yearning to master the external world while neglecting the deeper, creative power within.”</strong> – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>King Saul: The Mad King and the Desire for Control</strong></h2>
<p>Moving to <strong>King Saul</strong>, Neville Goddard sees him as symbolic of the <strong>ego</strong>, particularly in its disconnected state from deeper spiritual truth. Saul's reign starts with promise but is ultimately marked by instability, paranoia, and a desperate need to hold on to power. His downfall is rooted in his rejection of inner guidance, which creates internal conflict and erratic behaviour.</p>
<p>Trump’s presidency bore striking similarities to Saul’s. Both figures sought to maintain power at any cost, even when doing so undermined their own stability. Saul, as Neville portrays him, represents an ego that becomes consumed by its own self-importance and desire to control. This mirrors Trump’s approach—his actions were often driven by a sense of entitlement and a hunger for external validation. His clashes with those around him, much like Saul’s rejection of David, were a reflection of this tension between self-interest and a lack of alignment with a higher, more cohesive vision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Saul is the archetype of the ego unbound, seeking control while becoming increasingly unhinged due to its disconnection from divine guidance. The result is chaos.”</strong> – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>The Beast: The Ego Unleashed</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, we arrive at <strong>The Beast</strong>, a figure from the Book of Revelation symbolising the lowest, most chaotic aspects of human nature. The Beast represents the unrestrained, ego-driven consciousness that operates out of fear, manipulation, and primal instincts. In Neville’s framework, the Beast embodies the forces that are disconnected from higher, creative faculties, leading to divisiveness and conflict.</p>
<p>Trump’s presidency, with its frequent chaos and divisive rhetoric, can be interpreted as a manifestation of the Beast archetype. His political style often focused on stoking fear and rallying support through appeals to primal emotions and instincts—much like the Beast exploits fear to control and divide. The Beast’s power is built on chaos and division, and Trump’s leadership often reflected this approach, creating an environment of polarisation and heightened anxiety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The Beast thrives on division, fear, and primal instincts—forces that were undeniably present in Trump’s rhetoric and actions during his time in office.”</strong> – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: The Struggle and Transformation of Consciousness</strong></h2>
<p>According to Neville Goddard, the Bible isn’t merely a historical account but a symbolic journey of inner transformation. Figures like Cain, Saul, and the Beast represent states of consciousness that we all experience: the struggle between the ego and deeper spiritual alignment. In this framework, Donald Trump’s presidency can be seen as embodying these forces—the <strong>outer man</strong> (Cain), the <strong>mad king</strong> (Saul), and the <strong>chaotic Beast</strong> (the ego unrestrained).</p><div class="share-dropdown">
