<h1>Abraham and Sarah: Sister Spouse Courtship</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In the Bible, Abraham twice refers to Sarah as his <strong>sister</strong> rather than his <strong>wife</strong> or <i>spouse</i> (Genesis 12:10-13, Genesis 20:2-3). This is more than a literal event—it symbolises the evolving relationship between <strong>consciousness</strong> (Abraham) and <strong>imagination </strong>(Sarah), a central theme in Neville Goddard’s teachings.</p><hr><h3>The Biblical Dialogue: “She is My Sister”</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.”</em><br>
— Genesis 12:13 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote><p>Abraham’s claim reveals an <strong>inner hesitation</strong>: he recognises Sarah presence but has not yet fully committed to the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">intimate creative union symbolised by marriage</a>. This reflects how the conscious mind can sometimes hold back from fully embracing the imaginative mind’s power.</p><hr><h3>Sarah’s Barrenness: The Unused Imagination </h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Sarai was barren; she had no child.”</em><br>
— Genesis 11:30 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote><p>Sarah’s barrenness reflects a subconscious mind still inactive or unproductive—waiting for the conscious mind’s full belief and imaginative acceptance to bring forth creation.</p><hr><h3>The Sister-Spouse Dynamic in Song of Solomon</h3><p>The emotional tension and transformation from <strong>“sister”</strong> to <strong>“wife”</strong> is poetically captured in the <em>Song of Solomon</em>, where the beloved is both <strong>sister</strong> and <strong>bride</strong>, symbolising the journey from recognition to union.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride; you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes...”</em><br>
— Song of Solomon 4:9 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the beloved is simultaneously sister and bride—familiar yet destined for full, intimate union. This duality reflects the conscious mind’s initial perception of the subconscious as close but not fully united.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I would lead you and bring you to the house of my mother — she who has taught me...”</em><br>
— Song of Solomon 8:2 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote><p>This reference to the mother’s house symbolises the old beliefs and states of consciousness (the “mother-father” structure) that Abraham still clings to, just like the inner man Ruben clings to his birthright and lineage instead of fully “leaving” to cleave to his wife.</p><hr><h3>The Psychological Meaning: Partial Recognition vs Full Creative Partnership</h3><p></p><blockquote>For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh. - Genesis 2:24</blockquote><p></p><p>Calling Sarah “sister” indicates the conscious mind’s partial recognition of the imaginative mind. It’s a close, familial relationship, but not yet the foundational<a href="genesis-224-love.html"> <strong>creative marriage first spoken in Genesis</strong> </a>where conscious desire is fully impressed upon the subconscious to manifest reality.</p><p>Abraham’s hesitation mirrors how the mind often clings to old frameworks (the “mother-father” consciousness) instead of fully leaving behind limiting beliefs to embrace the subconscious as the fertile ground of creation.</p><hr><h3>The Fulfilment: Isaac’s Birth as Manifestation of Union</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“The Lord was gracious to Sarah... Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age...”</em><br>
— Genesis 21:1-2 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote><p>Isaac’s birth symbolises the <strong>fruitful union</strong> of consciousness and subconsciousness—the moment desires conceived in imagination take physical form, revealing the power of full creative partnership.</p><hr><h3>Summary of Neville Goddard’s Insight</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sarah as “sister”</strong>: subconscious mind recognised but not fully embraced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Barrenness</strong>: subconscious inactive before belief and imagination awaken it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abraham’s hesitation</strong>: conscious mind clinging to old beliefs and fears, paralleling Ruben’s attachment to lineage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Song of Solomon’s sister-bride</strong>: poetic portrayal of the psychological progression from partial recognition to full union</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaac’s birth</strong>: manifestation that follows the conscious mind’s full surrender and union with the subconscious</p>
</li>
</ul><hr><p>This narrative teaches that true creative power lies in the <strong>full union of consciousness and subconsciousness</strong>. The claim of Sarah being Abraham’s sister reveals the intermediate stage—recognition without full surrender—while the Song of Solomon’s imagery inspires the journey toward joyful, creative unity.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-abraham-series.html" class="noTag">Abraham Series</a> | <a href="label-bride---bridegroom-series.html" class="noTag">Bride — Bridegroom Series</a> | <a href="label-genesis-2-24-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 2:24 Series</a></p>
