<h1>God - The Wind and the Window Symbolism </h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<blockquote>"Then the LORD answered Job out of the <i><b>whirlwind</b></i>." — Job 38:1
<br><br>
"And there came to them the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening <b><i>wind</i></b>." — Genesis 3:8</blockquote>
<p>In the Bible, <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> is often symbolised by wind or breath: an invisible, powerful force that moves and transforms. Neville Goddard teaches that these symbols describe inner processes of <strong>consciousness</strong> and the power of <strong>assumption</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Head as the House</h2>
<p>In the <a href="the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew alphabet, the letter <strong>He (ה)</strong> is associated with a <strong>window</strong></a>. Symbolically, this ties directly to the <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">head as a house — the seat of consciousness</a>. Just as a house contains many rooms, the head contains all your thoughts, feelings, and self-concepts. The window of this house represents <strong>imagination</strong>, the opening through which God’s creative Spirit can flow.</p>
<h2>Wind as God’s Creative Movement</h2>
<p>The <strong>wind</strong> in Scripture represents God’s Spirit moving through consciousness. Wind is invisible but powerful; it cannot be contained, yet it is felt everywhere it moves. Similarly, the movement of God’s (<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM that I AM </a>) Spirit is experienced through the force of assumption — the act of living in the feeling of a wish fulfilled. When your imagination is focused and engaged, the wind of God flows through your consciousness and shapes your reality.</p>
<h2>Biblical Examples of Wind and Spirit</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>John 3:8</strong> – “The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</li>
<li><strong>Genesis 1:2</strong> – “The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” The word “Spirit” is often translated as wind or breath.</li>
<li><strong>Ezekiel 37:9-10</strong> – “Prophesy unto the wind… breathe upon these slain, that they may live.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Connecting the Window and Wind in Neville’s Teachings</h2>
<p>Your <strong>imagination</strong> is the <strong>window</strong> in your head through which the <strong>wind</strong> of God moves. This process can be understood in three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Imagination as the Window</strong>
<p>The window is the point where your conscious mind opens to the unseen spiritual realm. By imagining a desire fulfilled, you open this window and allow the creative force to enter.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Wind as Creative Power</strong>
<p>The wind represents God’s Spirit and the movement of assumption. It is the active, invisible force that works through your imagination. When you live in the feeling of your fulfilled desire, the wind flows through the window and shapes your inner reality.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>The Flow of Creation</strong>
<p>The window and wind together show the process of manifestation: your head (house) holds your consciousness, your imagination (window) focuses the creative energy, and the wind (Spirit) moves that energy into tangible form. Without the window, the wind cannot enter; without the wind, the window has no effect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Assumption and the Power of Consciousness</h2>
<p>Assumption is the conscious act of imagining a state as real. Through the lens of Neville’s teachings, every assumption made in the mind flows like wind through the window of consciousness, shaping experience and directing reality. The Hebrew letter <strong>He</strong> reminds us that the opening to divine movement is already within us — our imagination is the window through which God acts.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">head is the <strong>house</strong> of consciousness</a>. The <strong>window</strong> is imagination, the point of access to God - I AM that I AM. The <strong>wind</strong> is Spirit, the invisible movement that brings your <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assumptions</a> into form. By focusing on your imagination and living in the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you open the window and allow the wind of God to flow through you. In this way, you participate consciously in creation. Neville would say: <strong>“Imagination is the only redemptive power in the universe.”</strong></p>
<p>By understanding the connection between the house, the window, and the wind — head, imagination, and Spirit — we see that God’s creative movement is not distant, but flows naturally through the conscious use of imagination.</p>
