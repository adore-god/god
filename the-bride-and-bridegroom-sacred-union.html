    <h1>The Bride and the Bridegroom:  Psychological Marriage</h1>
    <blockquote><p><strong>“But in the middle of the night there is a cry, The husband comes! Go out to him.”</strong><br/>
— <em>Matthew 25:6</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="genesis-224-love.html">bride and bridegroom</a> story in Scripture points to a deeper truth: the inner <a href="genesis-224-love.html">marriage</a> of your awareness (the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">bridegroom</a>) and your imagination or desire (the bride). Neville Goddard teaches that this wedding is not outside you, nor a future hope—it is a spiritual union happening now whenever you <strong>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>, birthing a new state of being.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Genesis 2:24 — The Pattern</h2>
<p><a href="genesis-224-love.html">Marriage symbolism</a> starts with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh.”</strong><br/>
— <em>Genesis 2:24</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>man</strong> is <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">Assumption</a></strong>—choosing a new identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>father and mother</strong> are past conditioning, inherited beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html"><strong>wife</strong> is the <strong>new state</strong></a>—the imagined desire felt as real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“One flesh” is the union of assumption and feeling; the act of manifestation, and it's hardening into fact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>Old Testament Foundations: Soul as the Bride</h2>
<p>In Hebrew Scriptures, <a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel</a> is often portrayed as God’s bride. Symbolically, <strong>Israel is not a nation</strong> but <strong>the current collection of dominant thoughts</strong> within—those led by your <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> awareness. Initially gathered thoughts were simply 'people'.</p>
<p>Verses like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name.”</strong> — <em>Isaiah 54:5</em><br/>
<strong>“Turn, O backsliding children... for I am married unto you.”</strong> — <em>Jeremiah 3:14</em><br/>
<strong>“And I will betroth you unto me for ever... in lovingkindness and in mercies.”</strong> — <em>Hosea 2:19</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These passages show that the soul (imagination) is eternally united with the I AM. When Israel “fears God,” it means the current thought structure is shaken by new realisation. Eventually, a new inner order—<a href="elohim-god.html">Elohim</a>, the judges and rulers—takes place from this union.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>New Testament Fulfilment</h2>
<p>In John:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“He that has the bride is the bridegroom.”</strong> — <em>John 3:29</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">imagination itself is the bridegroom</a> coming to the soul. The intellect (John) prepares the way, but only imagination (Christ) gives birth to a new inner state.</p>
<p><strong>You are the bride of your own fulfilled desire; Christ is your power to give life to it.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<h2>Ten Virgins: Readiness of the Soul</h2>
<p>The parable of the ten virgins offers a clear metaphor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>lamps</strong> are imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>oil</strong> is persistent feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>cry</strong>, “The husband comes! Go out to him,” warns that readiness matters now. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Be like the wise virgins: keep your lamp lit. Maintain the state inside until the door opens.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Ephesians 5: The Mystery of the Inner Marriage</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">Husbands</a>, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the <a href="elohim-god.html">church</a>... This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.”</strong> — <em>Ephesians 5:25 &amp; 32, BBE</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage unveils the wedding: <strong>Christ</strong> is imagination, <strong>the <a href="elohim-god.html">church</a></strong> is the state you assume. When they unite in love and faith, a spiritual birth happens. A new inner ruling power—<strong>Elohim</strong>—convenes. That is the <strong>marriage of the soul</strong>: old chaos aligned into divine authority.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Revelation: The Marriage Supper and New Jerusalem</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Let us rejoice... for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.”</strong> — <em>Revelation 19:7, BBE</em><br/>
<strong>“I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down... prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.”</strong> — <em>Revelation 21:2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These images speak of consciousness fully prepared, the imagined state now descending into form. When your inner bride is ready, she becomes reality. Sheep shepherd and <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">lamb</a> symbolism are first defined in the story of Cain and Abel. The <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Lamb</a> is a symbol of a brand new and pure assumption being offered to the imagination.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Conclusion: The Wedding Is Always Now</h2>
<p>Every time you assume your wish fulfilled, you meet your bridegroom. The marriage is inward. The union births a new identity and power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Assume it. Live it. That is the wedding.”</em> — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is no distant ritual—it is the living moment of transformation.*</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bride---bridegroom-series.html">Bride — Bridegroom Series</a> | <a href="label-genesis-2-24-series.html">Genesis 2:24 Series</a> | <a href="label-marriage-series.html">Marriage Series</a> | <a href="label-song-of-solomon-series.html">Song of Solomon Series</a></p>
