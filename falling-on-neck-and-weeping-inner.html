<h1>“Falling on the Neck and Weeping” — Inner Reconciliation in the Bible</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p></p><p>In the Bible, moments where men fall on each other’s necks and <strong>kiss</strong> are deeply emotional—and through Neville Goddard’s teaching, they reveal something even more profound: these moments symbolise the <strong>reconciliation or revelation of inner assumptions merging with outer reality</strong>.</p><p>Imagination is not just a mental exercise but the <strong>creative power</strong> that shapes the external world. The emotional intensity of these encounters highlights the point where your <strong>inner assumption becomes physical manifestation</strong>—when what you’ve imagined becomes real.</p><hr/><h2>Key Examples Reinterpreted through Neville’s Framework:</h2><h3>Esau and Jacob — Reconciliation of the Old and New Self</h3><p><em>“Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.”</em><br/>
(Genesis 33:4, BBE)</p><p>Esau represents the outward man, the natural self, while Jacob is the inner man, the imaginer who has wrestled with God (his own consciousness) and prevailed. Their embrace and kiss mark the merging of the old and new states of consciousness—the external reality (Esau) meeting the assumed ideal (Jacob). The <strong>weeping</strong> that follows is the emotional overflow when an assumption is fulfilled, the moment when <strong>inner imagination and outer reality finally converge</strong>.</p><hr/><h3>Joseph and Benjamin — Reunion of Affection and Imagination</h3><p><em>“He fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept... Moreover, he kissed all his brethren.”</em><br/>
(Genesis 45:14–15, BBE)</p><p>Joseph, the exalted imaginer, reconnects with Benjamin, the pure expression of unwavering affection for his ideal. Their embrace and kisses show the union of <strong>affection and imagination</strong>—the emotional recognition that inner truth (Joseph) and deep sincere feeling (Benjamin) are now aligned. The <strong>weeping</strong> is the overflow of joy when an assumption manifests in reality.</p><hr/><h3>Joseph and Jacob (Israel) — Fulfilment of the Long-Held Assumption</h3><p><em>“And Joseph... fell on [Jacob’s] neck, and wept on his neck a good while.”</em><br/>
(Genesis 46:29, BBE)</p><p>Jacob had assumed for years that Joseph was dead. His weeping and embrace symbolise the climactic moment when a long-held assumption manifests. Joseph, the fulfilment of Jacob’s earlier dream, appears in flesh. This moment is the merging of imagination and reality, the fulfilment of belief made manifest.</p><hr/><h3>David and Jonathan — Love’s Loyalty to the Emerging Manifestation</h3><p><em>“They kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.”</em><br/>
(1 Samuel 20:41, BBE)</p><p>Jonathan represents love and loyalty to the higher self, while David symbolises the emergent manifestation. Their kiss and weeping mark the moment when the ideal (Jonathan) and the manifested state (David) merge, symbolising inner alignment. The <strong>weeping</strong> shows emotional release as the assumption begins to be realised externally.</p><hr/><h3>Judas and Jesus — The Kiss of Recognition and Revelation</h3><p><em>“Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.”</em><br/>
(Matthew 26:48–49, BBE)</p><p><em>“And Judas, which betrayed him, took a band of men, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, and came thither with lanterns and weapons. Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?”</em><br/>
(Luke 22:47–48, BBE)</p><p>Kissing in the Bible often signals <strong>recognition, reunion, or revelation</strong>. Judas’ kiss was an act of <strong>acknowledging Jesus as the Righteous One—the realised I AM</strong>, similar to how Jacob and Esau’s kiss symbolised reconciliation of estranged parts of self.</p><p>Unlike kisses of reunion marked by love and acceptance, Judas’ kiss serves as a <strong>revelation or identification</strong>, exposing Jesus to the external authorities. It symbolises the moment when the <strong>inner truth (the assumed ideal)</strong> is fully recognised but then handed over to outer reality for judgment.</p><p>From Neville Goddard’s perspective, Judas represents the part of consciousness that <strong>recognises the truth of the assumed fulfilled state (Jesus as I AM), yet does not fully embody or persist in it</strong>. The kiss is the act of seeing and acknowledging the ideal, but the subsequent handing over reflects the choice to surrender to external conditions rather than fully assume the new state.</p><p>Thus, Judas’ kiss is not merely betrayal; it is a <strong>complex moment of inner recognition, revelation, and the testing of faith in the assumption</strong>—a pivotal point where the imagined ideal is both revealed and challenged in the outer world.</p><hr/><h2>Weeping: The Watering of the Assumption</h2><p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, <strong>weeping</strong> is not just sorrow but a powerful symbol of <strong>emotional investment in the assumption</strong>. Just as mist watered the earth in creation (Genesis 2:6), weeping waters the imagination—emotionally nourishing the assumption until it manifests.</p><p>When biblical figures fall upon each other’s necks and weep, it symbolises the emotional energy that fertilises and brings the imagined state to life.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion: Merging Inner and Outer Reality</h2><p>The acts of <strong>kissing and weeping</strong> in these biblical stories are powerful symbols of the moment when <strong>inner imagination and outer reality merge</strong>. Through Neville’s law of Assumption, these moments show that the assumed state has been deeply felt and emotionally invested in, compelling external reality to align with internal vision.</p><hr/><p><strong>"There is no power outside your own consciousness... Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled."</strong><br/>
