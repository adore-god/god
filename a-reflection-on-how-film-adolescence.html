<h1>Netflix Drama — Adolescence: What We Accept in Imagination Becomes Our World</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Netflix’s <em>Adolescence</em> tells the chilling story of Jamie, a boy drawn into a world of violent online content. By the time he fatally stabs a classmate, it’s clear the act didn’t arise spontaneously—it was <b><a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagined</a></b>, rehearsed, and <a href="genesis-223-woman.html"><b>absorbed</b></a> long before it occurred. The series doesn’t simply portray a crime; it reveals the slow <a href="genesis-111-seed.html"><b>conditioning of a mind</b></a> left unguarded.</p>
<p>This is where the symbolic reading of the Bible, as pointed out by Neville Goddard, offers sobering clarity.</p>
<p>Neville showed that the Bible is not a record of historical events, but a psychological drama. Its stories symbolise inner processes, and its teachings reveal imagination as the creative power of <b><a href="elohim-god.html">God</a></b>. When the Bible speaks of creation, it speaks of thought becoming form, of <a href="genesis-126-man.html"><b>inner images</b></a> clothed in flesh.</p>
<p>The statement <em>"man moves in a world that is nothing more or less than his imagination pushed out"</em> summarises this, not as Neville’s invention, but as his discovery within Scripture. What we <b><a href="genesis-111-seed.html">dwell on inwardly shapes what we meet outwardly</a></b>. The law is silent, constant, and impartial.</p>
<p>In <em>Adolescence</em>, Jamie doesn’t consciously choose destruction. He simply absorbs what is offered—violent ideologies, despairing narratives, images charged with fear and rejection. These impressions settle into his subconscious, and from there, unfold.</p>
<p>The Bible, read symbolically, describes the subconscious as the womb of creation. It receives ideas without judgement and brings them to fruition. This isn’t a moral framework—it’s a spiritual mechanism. Whatever enters the inner chamber will find its way to the surface.</p>
<p>Both <em>Adolescence</em> and Scripture issue the same warning: guard your inner world. Every image we accept plants a seed. If we don’t choose our imaginal diet, the world will choose it for us—and rarely with kindness.</p>
<p>The Bible gives us tools for inner direction—revision, prayer, visualisation, and the practice of calling <em>“things which be not as though they were.”</em> These are not whimsical rituals but disciplines of conscious imagining. They allow us to author our experience instead of being written by the world around us.</p>
<p>Jamie’s tragedy is one of unconscious creation. His imagination was trained before he ever knew it was his to guide. <em>Adolescence</em> doesn’t just tell a story—it cautions us to take responsibility for the unseen realm within.</p>
<p>The world hurls images at us every day. But only what we accept—only what we <em>believe</em>—takes root.</p>
<p>Choose carefully.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
