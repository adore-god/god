<h1>Put On the New Self: Colossians 3:1-17</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p><em>A Neville Goddard Interpretation of Colossians 3:1–17</em></p>
<p>Paul’s message in Colossians 3 is not moralistic advice—it is mystical instruction for consciously assuming a new identity. Neville Goddard would read this chapter as a psychological roadmap for leaving behind the old man—the self ruled by appearances—and stepping into the new self, the man who knows imagination creates reality.</p>
<h3>Verses 1–2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Above” refers not to a physical sky or distant paradise, but to a higher state of consciousness. Heaven is the realm of imagination. It is where all things are conceived before they appear. “Being raised with Christ” means awakening to the truth that your <strong>own imagination is Christ</strong>, and to live in that elevated state by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<p>To “set your mind on things above” is to occupy the state of your desire already being fulfilled. Don’t react to appearances (“things on earth”), but assume the inner reality. If you imagine and persist in that assumption, the outer world must conform.</p>
<h3>Verse 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This death is symbolic. You die to the old self—the limited identity that believed in facts over faith. Your new life is “hidden”—that is, your imagined assumption is not yet visible. But it is sure, because it exists in imagination, the only true creative power.</p>
<h3>Verse 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When your assumption becomes visible—when your inner claim expresses itself outwardly—that is Christ appearing in glory. You are revealed in glory when what you imagined becomes fact. That is the Law of Assumption: <strong>what you accept as true of yourself will outpicture in your world</strong>.</p>
<h3>Verses 5–9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Put to death therefore what is earthly in you… anger, wrath, malice, slander…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These “earthly” behaviours are not sins in a religious sense; they are reactions of the old man—the self who believes in separation, fear, and struggle. To put them to death is to no longer give life to them through belief. They cannot live without your assumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lie is when you say “I am not” or “I cannot” while claiming to believe in imagination. To deny your power is the only real blasphemy. The Law of Assumption teaches that what you consent to as true, you make true. The old self consented to limitation. The new self consents to freedom.</p>
<h3>Verses 10–11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“…and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “image of the creator” is the imaginative act. You are renewed not by effort, but by assuming a new identity in consciousness. You imagine yourself into being. The new self knows: <strong>I AM is God</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Here there is no Greek and Jew… but Christ is all, and in all.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a statement of consciousness. There are no divisions in imagination. Your awareness is universal. Everyone is Christ dreaming they are this or that, until they wake up to their power.</p>
<h3>Verses 12–14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Put on then… compassion, kindness, humility…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To “put on” is to assume the state. As Neville taught, you do not attract what you want—you attract what you are conscious of being. Assume you are loving, assume you are whole. These are not actions, but states. Love is the highest assumption, because it harmonises all others. It binds the new self together in perfect unity.</p>
<h3>Verse 15</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peace comes when you stop striving and start assuming. The moment you fully accept the feeling of the wish fulfilled, inner peace settles. That is the “peace of Christ”—the inner stillness that knows it is done.</p>
<h3>Verse 16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “word” is imagination. Let it dwell in you richly—imagine boldly, lavishly. Let your assumptions fill your mind and body until you feel them real. Speak to yourself in psalms, hymns, and songs—that is, feed yourself only uplifting inner conversations.</p>
<h3>Verse 17</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To do all “in his name” means to act from the identity of “I AM.” Jesus means “I AM is salvation.” You affirm your true self with every assumption. Speak and move from the knowing that imagination creates reality—and it shall be done unto you.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-bible-verse-analysis.html" class="noTag">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-paul-s-letters--colossians.html" class="noTag">Paul's Letters: Colossians</a></p>
