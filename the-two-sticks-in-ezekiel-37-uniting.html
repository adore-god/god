<h1>The Two Sticks in Ezekiel 37: Uniting Praise and Imagination for Manifestation</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Ezekiel 37 presents a vision of restoration through the symbol of two sticks joined into one. Neville Goddard’s teachings reveal this as an inner process where divided states of consciousness unite through imagination and praise. The two sticks represent <strong>Judah</strong>, symbolising <strong>praise</strong> as the sovereign adoration expressed in the Song of Solomon, and <strong>Joseph</strong>, symbolising <strong>imagination</strong> through his biblical story of dreams and manifestation.</p><p>When praise and imagination are joined, they create a creative force that brings forth fulfilment and unity. This article breaks down Ezekiel 37 with the Bible passages and a focused interpretation on praise (Judah) and imagination (Joseph).</p><hr/><p><strong>The Two Sticks Represent Judah (praise) and Joseph (imagination)</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passage (Ezekiel 37:15-16, BBE):</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>“The word of the Lord came to me, saying,<br/>
‘Take one stick, and write on it, For Judah and the sons of Israel who are with him; then take another stick and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for the sons of Israel who are with him. And join the two sticks together, and they will be one in your hand.’”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
Here, the two sticks symbolise two essential faculties of conscious creation. <strong>Judah</strong> represents praise—the heart’s joyful, grateful response to the creative process, as beautifully expressed in the <strong>Song of Solomon</strong>. Praise is the sustaining force that nurtures faith and manifests desires.</p><p><strong>Joseph</strong> represents imagination—the creative faculty that shapes reality through vision and belief. Joseph’s story, marked by dreams, interpretation, and eventual manifestation of those dreams, exemplifies the power of imagination.</p><p>The command to join these two sticks into one is the inner act of uniting praise and imagination, the necessary union for manifestation to become reality.</p><hr/><p><strong>The Joining of Praise and Imagination</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passage (Ezekiel 37:17, BBE):</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>“When the sons of your people say to you, ‘Will you not tell us what you mean by this?’”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
Joining the sticks represents reconciling the heart’s praise with the mind’s imaginative vision. Neville Goddard emphasises that imagination alone is not enough—without the supporting energy of praise, the vision may remain unrealised.</p><p>Praise infuses imagination with life and certainty, allowing the assumed reality to take root in consciousness.</p><hr/><p><strong>The Meaning of the Joined Sticks</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passage (Ezekiel 37:18-19, BBE):</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>“Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel with him, and I will join it with the stick of Judah; and they will become one stick in my hand.’”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
This declaration reveals the creative act of consciously joining praise (Judah) and abundant imagination (Ephraim and Joseph) into one unified force. It is this unity that enables the manifestation of the desired state.</p><p>This process also introduces <strong>David</strong>, whose name means “beloved.” David symbolises the fulfilled desire—the outcome of this union between praise and imagination. He is the “king” or inner director who embodies the realised dream.</p><hr/><p><strong>The Reunited Kingdom Under David</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passage (Ezekiel 37:21-24, BBE):</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>“Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land. I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will be king over all of them. My servant David will be king over them; and they will all have one shepherd. They will follow my regulations and keep my laws, and will do them.’”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
The reunited kingdom symbolises the inner harmony achieved when praise and imagination are unified. Under one “king” — David, the beloved desire fulfilled — this unified consciousness brings forth a stable and abundant state of being.</p><p>This is the conscious state where divided beliefs and scattered energies are aligned and directed by the power of the fulfilled vision.</p><hr/><p><strong>The Everlasting Covenant of Peace</strong></p><p><strong>Bible passage (Ezekiel 37:26-28, BBE):</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>“I will make a peace agreement with them that will last for ever. I will give them a place and multiply them. I will put my holy place in the middle of them always. My tent will be with them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people. The nations will know that I, the Lord, make holy Israel, when my holy place is in the middle of them always.”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
The covenant of peace represents the permanence of the manifested reality born of the union of praise and imagination. This inner peace is the “sanctuary” where the creative power remains alive and active.</p><p>Praise keeps this sanctuary vibrant and sacred, ensuring the ongoing flow of abundance and fulfilment.</p><hr/><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The two sticks in Ezekiel 37 symbolise the union of <strong>praise (Judah)</strong> and <strong>imagination (Joseph)</strong> — the foundational powers that Neville Goddard teaches are essential for conscious creation. Through the joyful energy of praise and the visionary power of imagination, the believer unites divided states of consciousness into one. This union produces the “beloved” reality symbolised by David, the fulfilled desire reigning in a harmonious, abundant inner kingdom. This process culminates in an everlasting covenant of peace—an enduring, creative sanctuary within.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
