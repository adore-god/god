<h1>Ephesians 1: Before the Foundation of the World</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Paul&rsquo;s letter to the Ephesians opens with a vision of spiritual blessing, <a href="genesis-126-man.html">identity</a>, and inheritance &mdash; not in some far-off place, but in a realm he calls "heavenly places" (Eph. 1:3). For Neville Goddard, this <em>is</em> the realm of imagination &mdash; the interior world where assumption takes root and <a href="elohim-god.html">God&rsquo;s pattern unfolds</a>. Ephesians 1 is not a theology lesson; it's a map of the transformation that happens when the individual awakens to the truth of I AM.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Addressed to the Faithful in Christ Jesus</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus, by the purpose of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and to the true believers in Christ Jesus: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Ephesians 1:1&ndash;2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul begins by addressing those who are "<a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">faithful in Christ Jesus</a>" &mdash; not a just a title, but a state of being. To be "in <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a>" is to be consciously identified with the<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">&nbsp;<em>I AM</em></a>&nbsp;(God the Father) the divine creative centre within. This is not addressed to the religious, but to those awake to the pattern.</p>
<p>To be &ldquo;<a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">faithful in Christ Jesus</a>&rdquo; is to persist in the assumption that your desire is already fulfilled. This assumption, held faithfully, is the seed of every manifestation.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Every Spiritual Blessing in Heavenly Places</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has given us every blessing of the Spirit in the heavens in Christ.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Ephesians 1:3</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Heavenly places" is not some distant realm. For Neville, it&rsquo;s the inner world of imagination &mdash; the true creative power. Every blessing already exists <strong>within</strong> the consciousness of<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html"> I AM</a>&nbsp;(God the Father). <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a> is not a man outside you, but the patterned power that awakens within.</p>
<p>You are not trying to <em>earn</em> spiritual blessings. You are awakening to the fact that you were already blessed &mdash; in the inner world, the causal realm &mdash; and it is only your awareness of being that unveils them.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Chosen Before the Foundation of the World</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Even as he made selection of us in him from the first, before the making of the world, so that we might be holy and free from all evil before him in love: As we were marked out beforehand for the position of sons to himself, through Jesus Christ, in the good pleasure of his purpose, To the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely gave to us in the Loved One.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Ephesians 1:4&ndash;6</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a metaphysical statement. The choice happens <em>before</em> the physical world is even built &mdash; pointing to imagination as the true origin. To be &ldquo;chosen in him&rdquo; means to be identified with the one consciousness: I AM &mdash; the God and Father of your world. &ldquo;Holy and blameless&rdquo; is not about moral perfection but about wholeness &mdash; undivided attention, undivided identity.</p>
<p>Before any manifestation, the state must be assumed. Your desire exists before the world sees it &mdash; it&rsquo;s chosen <em>before the foundation</em> of your outer world. The phrase &ldquo;good <b>pleasure</b> of his purpose&rdquo; signals the inner act of imagining wisely and lovingly &mdash; the kind of <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">offering God accepts</a>, as shown in Genesis 4:4&ndash;7.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Redemption Through His Blood</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In whom we have salvation through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, through the wealth of his grace, Which he gave us in full measure in all wisdom and care; Having made clear to us the secret of his purpose, in agreement with the good pleasure which he had in himself, The ordering of the times when they are complete, to make all things new in Christ, the things in heaven and the things on the earth; in him, I say,&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Ephesians 1:7&ndash;10</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Blood&rdquo; symbolises life &mdash; consciousness itself. Redemption is not a transaction with an outer deity but the <strong>restoration</strong> of identity through the life of Christ awakened in you. Forgiveness here means release from the former state &mdash; letting go of old assumptions that &ldquo;missed the mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every time you return to the assumption of your wish fulfilled, you are &ldquo;forgiven&rdquo; &mdash; you are bought back, redeemed, through the life-blood of imagination. The phrase &ldquo;in agreement with the good <b>pleasure</b> which he had in himself,&rdquo; signals the inner act of imagining wisely and lovingly &mdash; the kind of offering God accepts, as shown in Genesis 4:4&ndash;7.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Inheritance in Christ</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In whom we have a heritage, marked out from the first in his purpose who does all things in agreement with the decisions of his will: So that his glory might have praise through us who first had hope in Christ:&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Ephesians 1:11&ndash;12</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inheritance is a key theme for Paul. And for Neville, inheritance is simply <strong>what you accept as true of yourself</strong>. The &ldquo;will&rdquo; of God is not fate, but consciousness directing itself. When you assume a state, you claim an inheritance &mdash; a reality that flows from the identity you occupy.</p>
<p>You become what you consent to be. The &ldquo;counsel of his will&rdquo; is the inner conversation and assumption that determines your experience.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Seal of the Holy Spirit</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In whom you, having given hearing to the true word, the good news of your salvation, in whom, having had faith, you were given the holy mark of the Spirit of hope, Which is the first-fruit of our heritage, till God gets back what is his, to the praise of his glory.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Ephesians 1:13&ndash;14</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; is to have the pattern impressed upon you &mdash; as wax receives a signet ring. The Holy Spirit is not a separate being; it is the animating force of imagination, pressing the assumption into the subconscious. It guarantees the outcome by establishing the state as already true.</p>
<p>Feeling is the secret. You are sealed when the feeling of the wish fulfilled becomes real &mdash; not outwardly, but inwardly.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>A Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For this reason I give praise, because I had news of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and of your love to all the saints, And I give praise without end for you, keeping you in mind in my prayers; That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; And that the eyes of your heart may be lighted up, so that you may see what is the hope of his purpose, what is the wealth of the glory of his heritage in the saints, And how unlimited is his power to us who have faith, as is seen in the working of the strength of his power,&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Ephesians 1:15&ndash;19</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Paul's prayer for illumination &mdash; and it perfectly aligns with Neville&rsquo;s invitation to awaken. &ldquo;The eyes of your heart&rdquo; refer to imagination &mdash; the inner eye. Revelation is personal: the realisation that Christ is in you, and that imagination is the operative force behind all reality.</p>
<p>Christ is not something to believe in, but something to awaken to. Revelation is the moment you see &mdash; not with the eyes of reason, but with the eyes of your heart.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Christ Raised and Enthroned</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;By which he made Christ come back from the dead, and gave him a place at his right hand in heaven, Far over all rule and authority and power and every name which is named, not only in the present order, but in that which is to come: And he has put all things under his feet, and has made him to be head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the full measure of him in whom all things are made complete.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Ephesians 1:20&ndash;23</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resurrection of Christ is not just historical &mdash; it is symbolic. Christ rises in you when your assumption becomes fixed. The &ldquo;right hand&rdquo; symbolises power &mdash; and to be seated there is to rest in assumption, to abide in the fulfilled state. The Church is not a building &mdash; it is the collective body of those who embody this pattern.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the pattern man. The story of his resurrection is your story &mdash; the moment you die to the old state and rise in the awareness of your new self.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: You Were Always the Temple</strong></h2>
<p>Ephesians 1 is not about religion. It is a mystical scroll declaring that your inner man &mdash; your I AM &mdash; is the image in which all things are formed. The blessings are already yours, the inheritance awaits your claim, and the pattern of Christ is the mystery of your own becoming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;God became man, that man may become God.&rdquo; &mdash; Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Ephesians 1 shows you exactly how.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
