<h1>Cain and Abel: Murder in Imagination </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The story of Cain and Abel can be seen as a symbol of what happens inside the mind before <a href="abraham-promise-and-covenant.html">the promise of a new reality is accepted</a>. <a href="genesis-126-man.html">Abel represents imagination</a>—the creative power inside us that, when assumed as real, brings new possibilities to life. Cain, on the other hand, represents the negative mind, full of doubt, fear, and resistance.</p>
<p>Before <a href="abraham-promise-and-covenant.html">the promise </a>was introduced and <a href="sarahs-laughter-humour-of-manifestation.html">Sarah initially laughed at it</a>, the mind struggled to believe that what it imagined could really come true. Instead of nurturing imagination, negativity would “kill” it. Cain killing Abel shows this <a href="cain-lamech-and-jesus-psychology-of.html">destructive cycle</a>: the imagination (Abel) is attacked by the doubting and fearful mind (Cain).</p>
<p>Without the promise—the firm belief that what you assume in your imagination will become real—imagination is fragile and vulnerable. The mind keeps “killing” its own creative power through disbelief and negativity. This is why so many people struggle to manifest their desires; their imagination is not yet protected by faith.</p>
<p>The promise is the turning point. It offers assurance that imagination is powerful and real. Once you accept the promise and assume your imagined desires as true, the cycle of negativity is broken, and creation can flow freely.</p>
<p>In this way, Cain and Abel are not just two brothers, but psychological allegory of the inner battle between doubt and faith, destruction and creation. The story reminds us that before we can bring our dreams to life, we must stop killing our own imagination with negativity and begin trusting the promise of what is possible.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
