<h1>The Twelve Tribes: Psychological Territories</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In the Book of Joshua, the land of Canaan is divided among the twelve tribes of Israel. On the surface, it appears to be a matter of boundaries and geography. But to the awakened soul—the one Neville Goddard taught to read Scripture as spiritual psychology—this moment marks a pivotal shift: the <strong>ordering of the inner man</strong>.</p>
<p>The “Promised Land” is consciousness - the <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-eden-series.html">metaphorical Garden of Eden</a>. And the division of that land symbolises <strong>assigning specific aspects of yourself to support <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">your chosen state of being</a></strong>.</p>
<p>When Joshua (the evolving “I AM”) divides the land, it is not bureaucracy—it is the <strong>spiritual discipline of assumption</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Each Tribe as a Faculty of the Mind</h2>
<p>Below is a symbolic interpretation of each tribe’s allotment—how Neville might see each one as representing a <strong>distinct inner function</strong>:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Judah – Praise (Southern Allotment)</strong></h3>
<p>Judah receives the first and largest portion. Symbolically, this faculty is <strong>praise</strong>—the vibration of thankfulness and assumption already fulfilled. Praise is foundational; it sustains every other inner state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. That is praise.” – <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>2. Ephraim – Spiritual Imagination (West-Central)</strong></h3>
<p>As a son of Joseph, Ephraim represents the <strong>visionary power of imagination</strong> that outpictures the unseen. This tribe’s strength is in <em>conceiving the end and living from it</em>.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Manasseh – Memory Redeemed (Split Territory North and East)</strong></h3>
<p>Also from Joseph, Manasseh is <strong>the faculty of memory</strong>, especially in its redeemed state—<em>forgetting what no longer serves, and remembering what to assume</em>. The two halves symbolise memory that spans past limitation and present potential.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Reuben – Emotional Strength (East of Jordan)</strong></h3>
<p>The firstborn, Reuben symbolises <strong>initial emotional vitality</strong>, often unstable when undirected. It is the beginning of strength, needing guidance by higher faculties.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Simeon – Hearing (South, within Judah)</strong></h3>
<p>Simeon means “heard,” and symbolises <strong>inner hearing</strong>—your ability to tune in to divine guidance, inner speech, and self-talk. It is placed <em>within Judah</em>, because inner hearing must be grounded in praise.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Levi – Devotion (No land, Cities throughout)</strong></h3>
<p>Levi, the priestly tribe, receives no land but scattered cities. It represents <strong>devotion, sanctity, and self-discipline</strong>—not owning anything, but <em>upholding everything</em>. It is the unifying vibration of the sacred within the whole self.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Dan – Judgement and Discernment (Far North)</strong></h3>
<p>Dan means “judge.” This tribe represents the <strong>faculty of discernment</strong>—what thoughts you allow, what assumptions you cast out. Located in the extremes, it keeps the borders of consciousness in check.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Naphtali – Spiritual Flexibility and Beauty (North)</strong></h3>
<p>Naphtali is associated with <em>freedom and poetic beauty</em>. This is the faculty of <strong>spiritual agility</strong>—the ability to delight in new assumptions and move gracefully between states without getting stuck.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Gad – Active Power and Expansion (East of Jordan)</strong></h3>
<p>Gad denotes <strong>movement, overcoming, and dominion</strong>. It is the will-to-act within consciousness, especially at the boundaries. It guards transition and supports expansion.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Asher – Blessedness and Affirmation (Northwest Coast)</strong></h3>
<p>Asher symbolises <strong>the feeling of being blessed and favoured</strong>. It governs affirmation, ease, and the soft receptivity that Neville often said was <em>essential for conception</em> of desire.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Issachar – Inner Knowing and Devotion to Labour (Central North)</strong></h3>
<p>Issachar is the faculty of <strong>deep intuition and spiritual endurance</strong>. It "bows its shoulder" to bear burdens, symbolising the quiet inner knowing that persists in faith even when no fruit is seen.</p>
<h3><strong>12. Zebulun – Merchant and Outreach (Northwest Coast)</strong></h3>
<p>Zebulun represents the faculty of <strong>expression and outward engagement</strong>—the part of you that <em>brings the internal world into contact with the external</em>. It is the marketplace of consciousness.</p>
<h3><strong>13. Benjamin – Alignment and Protection (Central, next to Judah)</strong></h3>
<p>Benjamin, the youngest, is the <strong>integrating presence</strong>—the still point of trust and spiritual alignment. It often symbolises the protected centre of consciousness, where the temple (Jerusalem) is later placed.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Possessing the Inheritance</h2>
<p>It is one thing to receive an allotment. It is another to <strong>possess it</strong>.</p>
<p>Many tribes failed to drive out former inhabitants. Likewise, you may <em>know</em> the truth but still live under the rule of old assumptions. The act of <em>dividing the self</em> is not merely symbolic—it is a <strong>call to inhabit each role fully</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You must live in the end. Dwell there. Make it natural.” – <em>Neville</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h2>The Inner Kingdom</h2>
<p>Joshua’s division of the land is a call to <strong>inner rulership</strong>. Each faculty of your consciousness must be trained, honoured, and directed. No tribe is meaningless. Every portion of your awareness has a divine function.</p>
<p>And when your self is rightly divided—when your faculties are disciplined and aligned—your world reflects it.</p>
<p>You are no longer wandering in a spiritual wilderness. You are home.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
