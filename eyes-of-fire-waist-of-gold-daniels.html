<h1>Daniel: Visions of a Man</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<blockquote><p><strong>"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion..."</strong><br/>
— Genesis 1:26</p>
</blockquote><p>This foundational verse declares that you are <a href="genesis-126-man.html">created in the image and likeness of God</a>, endowed with dominion — not simply over outer things, but over your inner states of consciousness.</p><p>For Neville Goddard, this dominion is the ability to assume a desired state and persist in it until it becomes fact. The tenth chapter of Daniel vividly illustrates this process. Daniel’s vision of the radiant man is not an external angel but the revelation of the true, fulfilled self — the man made in God’s image, fully embodying creative mastery.</p><hr/><h2>Mourning Before Transformation</h2><blockquote>
<p>"In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks..."<br/>
— Daniel 10:2</p>
</blockquote><p>Daniel’s “mourning” symbolises the inner discontent that precedes transformation. This is the tension felt when the old self no longer satisfies and the new state is calling to be born.</p><p>Neville saw this phase as the necessary disturbance that stirs you to move beyond current limitations and claim a higher self-concept.</p><hr/><h2>The Vision of the Fulfilled Self</h2><blockquote>
<p>"Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz..."<br/>
— Daniel 10:5</p>
</blockquote><p>The radiant man is not separate from Daniel — he is Daniel’s ideal self, fully assumed.</p><p>Linen represents purity, and gold symbolises incorruptibility and spiritual value. The girding at the loins, the generative centre, indicates that this new identity is consciously empowered and fully accepted as real.</p><hr/><h2>Eyes Like Lamps of Fire</h2><blockquote>
<p>"His body also was like beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire..."<br/>
— Daniel 10:6</p>
</blockquote><p>Eyes as lamps of fire signify unwavering inner focus. In Neville’s terms, the “single eye” is the eye that sees only the fulfilled end.</p><p>These fiery eyes demonstrate an unwavering gaze — an inner vision purified by the fire of conviction, seeing no opposition, no doubt, only the assumed truth.</p><hr/><h2>Others Cannot Perceive It</h2><blockquote>
<p>"The men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled..."<br/>
— Daniel 10:7</p>
</blockquote><p>The men who flee represent the old thought patterns and beliefs that cannot survive when a higher state is fully assumed.</p><p>As you become the new man, created in God’s image and likeness, your old support systems — the limiting ideas — fall away in fear and collapse.</p><hr/><h2>The Collapse of the Old Self</h2><blockquote>
<p>"Yet I heard the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice... I was in a deep sleep on my face..."<br/>
— Daniel 10:9</p>
</blockquote><p>Falling flat signifies the symbolic death of the old self. The “deep sleep” is the creative state where the new assumption is impressed upon the subconscious, echoing the creative sleep in Genesis when woman (a new expression) is drawn out of Adam.</p><hr/><h2>Delay Is Not Denial</h2><blockquote>
<p>"Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day... thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days..."<br/>
— Daniel 10:12–13</p>
</blockquote><p>From the first day Daniel assumed his new state, it was accepted — “thy words were heard.”</p><p>The “prince of Persia” symbolises subconscious resistance — old conditioning and habitual doubts. Neville taught that delays are not denials; they are simply signs to persist and hold the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p><hr/><h2>Strengthening Through Revisiting</h2><blockquote>
<p>"Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me..."<br/>
— Daniel 10:18</p>
</blockquote><p>Being “touched” again shows the importance of repeatedly revisiting the fulfilled state. Neville emphasised that feeling is the secret — to dwell in the new state until it becomes natural and embodied.</p><hr/><h2>Becoming the Image and Likeness</h2><p>Daniel’s radiant man is the living fulfilment of Genesis 1:26 — the true man, consciously assumed and realised.</p><p>He is not an angelic being to worship, but your own higher self — the “I AM” identity clothed in purity and power, standing in dominion over inner states.</p><p>Through mourning (discontent), vision (assumed end), collapse (death of the old self), persistence (overcoming resistance), and revisiting (strengthening), you move into your true likeness — the divine image fully expressed in the world.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion: The Creative Dominion</h2><p>Daniel 10 is not a story of heavenly messengers but a psychological pattern for transformation.</p><p>It is the journey from a limited self-image to the embodiment of the God's likeness — I AM — as declared in Genesis 1:26.</p><p>When you behold the glorious man — your fulfilled state — and persist in assuming it as real, you claim your creative dominion. This is how the Word becomes flesh, how the unseen becomes seen, and how you step into the full stature of your own divine being.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
