<h1>The Horror of Literalism and The Handmaid’s Tale</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Margaret Atwood’s <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> is a chilling exploration of what happens when scripture is read literally, wielded as a tool of control. In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women are reduced to roles derived from a selective, surface-level reading of the Bible—particularly the story of Rachel and her handmaid, Bilhah. This dystopian vision isn’t just imaginative horror; it reflects a deeper truth: literalism has long been used to justify the suppression of the feminine, robbing women of their symbolic and spiritual depth.</p>
<p>The biblical stories that Gilead uses are not inherently oppressive. It is the <strong>interpretation</strong> that matters. When taken literally, these stories seem to reinforce hierarchies and fixed roles. But Neville Goddard’s mystical approach offers a radical shift: he reads the Bible psychologically and symbolically, not historically. In doing so, he restores the <strong>power of the feminine</strong>—especially the symbolic function of the woman as the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, the womb of creation.</p>
<p>In Gilead, women are seen as vessels—but in the most reductive, physical sense. Neville, by contrast, sees the vessel as the inner creative faculty. The woman is not powerless—she is <strong>foundational</strong>. She is the <strong>receiver of seed (impression)</strong>, the <strong>nurturer of imagination</strong>, and the <strong>birther of new realities</strong>. This is not a call to submission, but to profound co-creation.</p>
<p>The handmaids in Atwood’s story are stripped of identity and forced into servitude. Yet Neville’s interpretation would say the true handmaid is not a person at all—it is the <strong>yielded subconscious</strong>, aligned with a divine assumption and bringing forth the manifestation of that inner belief. In this light, the phrase “Behold the handmaid of the Lord” (Luke 1:38) becomes a powerful declaration of imaginative faith, not a resignation to external authority.</p>
<p>Literalism imprisons. Symbolism liberates.</p>
<p>Neville’s vision gives the feminine back her voice—not as a reaction to patriarchy, but as a revelation of her eternal function. When the Bible is read psychologically, the so-called ‘problematic’ passages become <strong>deeply empowering</strong>. The barren womb becomes a metaphor for untapped potential. The handmaid becomes the space where God’s word takes root.</p>
<p>By reinterpreting Scripture, we move beyond dystopia and back into <strong>divine authorship</strong>—where every woman, and every man, is both the sower and the soil.</p>
<p><strong>The feminine is not passive. She is potent.</strong></p>
<p>Neville invites us to stop reading the Bible as history and start reading it as <strong>our own internal map</strong>. In this way, <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> becomes more than a warning—it becomes an invitation. An invitation to reclaim our imagination, to honour the feminine within, and to free Scripture from the chains of literalism.</p>
<p>And in doing so, we discover that the most powerful handmaid is the one who <strong>dares to imagine</strong>.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
