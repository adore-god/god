<h1>Ezekiel 16:1&ndash;15 &mdash; The Forgotten Bride of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p></p><p><em>A verse-by-verse symbolic interpretation through Neville Goddard&rsquo;s teachings</em></p><hr/>In Ezekiel 16, we find a deeply symbolic parable of spiritual origin, elevation, and eventual deviation. Through the teachings of Neville Goddard&mdash;particularly the Law of Assumption, which declares that "consciousness is the only reality"&mdash;this passage unfolds as a story of how the soul awakens through imaginative faith, clothes itself in assumption, and then tragically forgets its source.<br/><hr/><h3>Why <em>The Forgotten Bride of Assumption</em>?</h3><p>In Neville Goddard&rsquo;s teachings, the soul is symbolised as a bride&mdash;wedded to the creative power of imagination. When this inner self awakens, adorns itself with assumed truth, and rises in beauty and dominion, it lives as the beloved of the I AM. But when the soul forgets her source&mdash;trusting in appearances and seeking validation from the external world&mdash;she becomes, symbolically, the &ldquo;forgotten bride.&rdquo; Ezekiel 16 reveals this tragic yet instructive arc: a story of assumption remembered, fulfilled, and then abandoned.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 1</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,"</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:1, NKJV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
The "word of the Lord" symbolises the voice of inner awareness. A new instruction is coming from the creative core of imagination&mdash;the only source of true transformation.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 2</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:2, NKJV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
"Jerusalem" represents the inner state of being that has wandered into false identity. The imagination is calling the soul to remember the assumptions it has accepted that distort its true nature.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 3</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem: &lsquo;Your birth and your nativity are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:3, NKJV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
Your origin, as consciousness, has been conditioned by the outer world (Canaan = materialism). You were born into assumptions not of your choosing&mdash;passed on by a world unaware of imagination&rsquo;s power.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 4</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;On the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean. You were not rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:4, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
You remained emotionally and spiritually tethered to your past assumptions. No inner purification took place; you lived reactively, not imaginatively.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 5</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:5, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
You were discarded by the world&rsquo;s standards&mdash;unseen, unloved, unknown. But to the Law of Assumption, this is the fertile field from which a new self can emerge.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 6</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, &lsquo;Live!&rsquo; I said to you, &lsquo;Live!&rsquo;&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:6, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
Even in your lowest state, the voice of imagination affirms your life. A new concept of self is spoken into existence&mdash;through sheer assumption.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 7</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I made you grow like a plant in the field. You grew up and developed and became the most beautiful of jewels. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew, you who were naked and bare.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:7, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
You developed spiritual maturity, but had not yet clothed yourself in the feeling of your fulfilled desire. You remained unconvinced of your power.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 8</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your naked body. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you,&rdquo; declares the Sovereign Lord, &ldquo;and you became mine.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:8, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
This is the marriage of the soul with assumption. When you fully accept a new state of being, you commit to it&mdash;it becomes your identity.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 9</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:9, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
Your past is cleansed through new awareness. You are anointed&mdash;emotionally and imaginatively prepared&mdash;for manifestation.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 10</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put sandals of fine leather on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:10, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
These garments symbolise divine self-concepts. You wear new assumptions&mdash;beautiful and specific states of consciousness that now define your reality.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 11</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I adorned you with jewellery: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck,&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:11, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
Your creative faculties (hands and voice) are adorned with power. You act and speak from the authority of your assumed identity.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 12</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:12, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
The crown is dominion&mdash;consciousness ruling the imagination. You now receive from within (ears), discern beauty (nose), and reign over your inner world.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 13</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was honey, olive oil and the finest flour. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:13, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
This is full manifestation. The assumption has crystallised into visible success, satisfaction, and spiritual beauty. You now live the fulfilled desire.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 14</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendour I had given you made your beauty perfect,&rdquo; declares the Sovereign Lord.</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:14, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
Your outer glory came from the inner splendour of imaginative awareness. You manifest not from effort, but from assumption infused with feeling.</p><hr/><h3>Verse 15</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favours on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Ezekiel 16:15, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br/>
Here begins the fall. You forget the source (I AM) and start to trust only appearances. To "play the harlot" is to give your power away to the external world&mdash;seeking validation instead of remaining in assumption.</p><hr/><h3>Closing Reflection</h3><p>The arc of Ezekiel 16:1&ndash;15, when viewed through Neville Goddard&rsquo;s Law of Assumption, is the story of every soul who wakes up to their creative power, assumes a new identity, and must learn not to forget the inner source of all outward expression. To live in sustained manifestation, we must never mistake the mirror for the man&mdash;never confuse effect with cause.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
