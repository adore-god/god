<h1>The Dust of the World: Why Jesus Washed Feet</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In John 13, the Bible gives us a scene so specific, so ritualistic, that it almost feels out of place at the Last Supper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.<br>
After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet...”<br>
— <em>John 13:4–5</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the literal mind, it’s a touching act of humility. But to the seeker this scene reveals something deeper: a symbolic process of cleansing, preparation, and inner realignment.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Feet as Symbol of Understanding</strong></h3>
<p>Neville often explained that <em>feet</em> symbolise the <em>understanding</em> — the lowest form of perception, that which touches the outer world of sense and reaction. Just as the feet walk through dust and pick up the residue of the earth, the natural mind gathers impressions from the world around it: facts, fears, opinions, appearances — all of which condition what we believe is possible.</p>
<p>The “dust of the world” is the accumulation of belief in outer causation. To have dusty feet is to carry the weight of surface-level thinking.</p>
<p>So when <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus — the personification of imagination saving</a> by assumption — begins to wash the feet of his <a href="jesus-his-disciples-psychological-drama.html">disciples (which themselves represent various faculties of the mind)</a>, it is an act of inner purification. He is removing the residue of worldly limitation, cleansing the understanding so it can grasp the truth of being.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Towel and the Loins: Creative Preparation</strong></h3>
<p>But before the washing, another unusual moment occurs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He took a towel, and girded himself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is no incidental detail. In Scripture, <em>the loins</em> represent the generative or creative power — the source from which life is projected. To “gird the loins” means to ready oneself for intentional movement, to direct creative force.</p>
<p>The <em>towel</em> Jesus ties around his loins symbolises <em>the medium of expression</em> — the tool by which imagination acts. By wrapping it around himself, he shows that what is about to unfold is not a physical service but a creative, symbolic act. He is - you are - preparing the imagination to cleanse and renew the understanding.</p>
<p>Then, he <em>removes the towel</em> — stripping away the last barrier between creative intention and execution — and begins to wash. Remember that this is symbolic and the Bible uses <a href="paul-one-body-with-many-members.html">body parts as figurative to teach about the mind, which Paul later discusses</a></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>This Is You</strong></h3>
<p>What’s being described is not merely a moment in the life of a man 2,000 years ago, but an eternal process within you. Every time you revise a memory, imagine a better outcome, or refuse to accept the appearance of lack — you are washing feet. You are refusing to let the outer world dictate your inner state.</p>
<p>Jesus says, <em>“If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.”</em><br>
You cannot walk in imagination while the feet of your understanding are clogged with the world’s dust. The faculties must be washed — raised — in order to receive the truth: <em>“I AM the resurrection and the life.”</em></p><div class="share-dropdown">
