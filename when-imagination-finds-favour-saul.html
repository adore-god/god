<h1>When Imagination Finds Favour: Saul, David, and the Pleasing Offering of Abel</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In 1 Samuel 16, Saul—the reigning king and symbol of the current dominant perception or "man"—sends for David:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Then said Saul to Jesse, ‘Send me your son <i>David</i>, which is with the <b>sheep</b>.’” (1 Samuel 16:11)<br/>
“And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, ‘Let David stand before me; for he hath found <i><b>favour in my sight</b></i>.’” (1 Samuel 16:22)</p>
</blockquote><p>At a glance, these verses describe a historical event. Yet beneath the surface, they echo a profound psychological and spiritual concept about consciousness, alignment, and manifestation—mirroring the symbolic drama first revealed in Genesis 4:4-7.</p><hr/><h2>God’s Pleasure in Abel’s Offering and Saul’s Favour toward David</h2><p>In Genesis 4, we read:</p><blockquote>
<p>“And Abel gave an offering of the young lambs of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord was <b><i>pleased</i></b> with Abel’s offering;<br/>
But in Cain and his offering he had <i><b>no pleasure</b></i>.” (Genesis 4:4-5, BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p><a href="elohim-god.html">God’s</a> <a href="the-four-rivers-of-eden-flowing-delight.html">pleasure</a> in Abel’s offering signals alignment between the inner imaginative state and divine order—Abel’s offering represents the “feeling of the wish fulfilled,” the assumption of already being, which evokes harmony and favour.</p><p>Fast forward to 1 Samuel 16, Saul’s words,</p><blockquote>
<p>“He hath found favour in my sight,”</p>
</blockquote><p>echo this divine <a href="the-four-rivers-of-eden-flowing-delight.html">pleasure</a>. Here, <strong>Saul’s favour toward David symbolises the outer consciousness recognising and accepting the new imaginal state, </strong>David, the beloved and favoured <a href="the-father-son-symbolism-in-bible.html">son</a> who embodies the fulfilled assumption.</p><hr/><h2>The Parallel Between Abel and David: Inner State Favoured by Awareness</h2><p>Abel and David both represent the <strong>inner <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>, the imaginal self</strong> aligned with divine order and spiritual truth. Abel’s offering pleases God because it reflects an internal state of alignment—imagination manifesting harmony.</p><p>Similarly, David <strong>finds favour in Saul’s sight</strong> because he represents that new assumed state ready to be acknowledged and expressed in outer reality.</p><hr/><h2>Saul and Cain: Outer Resistance to Inner Truth</h2><p>Saul’s initial hesitation and eventual acceptance of David mirror <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Cain’s resistance to Abel’s inner reality.</a> Saul, like Cain, stands for the <strong>outer conscious mind</strong> that is tied to appearances and old assumptions.</p><p>The transition from rejection to favour represents the turning point when the outer mind accepts the new inner state—when imagination takes precedence over limiting outer facts.</p><hr/><h2>Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption in Play</h2><p>Neville’s teaching that “feeling is the secret” is demonstrated here in both stories:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Abel’s offering pleases because it is given in the feeling of the fulfilled state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David is favoured because he embodies the inner feeling that must be assumed before manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Saul’s favour is symbolic of the <strong>outer world reflecting your inner assumption</strong> once it is held firmly in consciousness.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion: The Spiritual Law of Favour and Manifestation</h2><p>The Bible’s narrative reveals a repeating spiritual principle:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>God’s pleasure in Abel’s offering</strong> illustrates the harmony of aligned imagination and consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saul’s favour toward David</strong> mirrors this acceptance, signalling the outer world’s readiness to manifest the new inner state.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The message is clear: When your inner assumption aligns with the feeling of the wish fulfilled, the outer world “finds favour” with you. You move from misalignment and “sin waiting at the door” to a state where your imagination shapes reality.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
