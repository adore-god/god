<h1>Sheep Shearing Symbolism</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In Scripture, sheep are symbols of our thoughts, impressions, and subconscious states — the <a href="elohim-god.html">inner flock that responds to the guidance of the conscious mind</a>.</p>
<p>Sheep-shearing, then, becomes a vivid metaphor: it is the mental process of trimming, clearing, and preparing the mind. Just as a <a href="scrolls/label-shepherd-and-lamb-series.html">shepherd</a> removes the old wool to allow the flock to grow anew, the mind must shed outdated beliefs and rigid thought patterns so that imagination — the creative power Neville Goddard spoke of — can bring forth new realities.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Act of Shearing as Mental Clearing</h2>
<p>Sheep-shearing symbolises:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Removal of old or unhelpful thoughts:</strong> The worn wool represents outdated beliefs, fears, and assumptions that no longer serve the mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exposure of fertile ground:</strong> Once the old is removed, the subconscious is revealed and ready to be impressed with new assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preparation for growth:</strong> Cleaned and trimmed, the flock — the mind — is ready to nurture new ideas, insights, and manifestations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is submission: just as the sheep is silent before the shearer, the mind must allow the old to be removed without resistance. This silence is not passivity but receptivity — a willingness to let imagination restructure the inner world.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Biblical Illustrations</h2>
<p>Though the principle is universal, Scripture provides moments that illustrate the symbolism:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Nabal at Sheep-Shearing (1 Samuel 25):</strong> The feast marks a season of shearing. <a class="aforce" href="exploring-symbolism-of-nabal-abigail.html">Nabal, representing the ego clinging to old beliefs, refuses to offer what is rightfully expected</a>. His rigidity and refusal show what happens when the mind resists trimming — decay and collapse of inner growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Judah at Sheep-Shearing (Genesis 38):</strong> Here, the shearing brings breakthrough. <a class="aforce" href="tamah-judah-and-perez.html">Judah ('praise') meets Tamar, a veiled symbol of a hidden subconscious condition</a>, and from this encounter comes Perez — whose name means “breakthrough.” This is the mind yielding to the trimming process, allowing old coverings to fall away and new life to emerge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The <a class="aforce" href="the-suffering-servant-imagination.html">Suffering Servant</a>, Isaiah 53:</strong> “As a lamb before its shearer is silent…” This is imagination itself, yielding without resistance. The old is removed, the seed of new consciousness is planted, and transformation begins quietly within.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>The Practical Lesson</h2>
<p>Sheep-shearing teaches that mental cleansing is not painful if approached with awareness. Each “season” of inner trimming is an opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notice thoughts and beliefs that no longer serve your desired state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="repentance-from-guilt-to-imagination.html">Revise</a> and let them go consciously, as the shearer removes the wool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare the mind to receive fresh assumptions — the raw material for imagination to manifest reality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Neville Goddard said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dare to assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and continue therein. For the assumption, though false, if persisted in, will harden into fact.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The act of assumption, like the shearing, requires the old to be removed first. Clean your inner flock, allow imagination to sow new seeds, and watch your inner life — and your outer reality — transform.</p>
