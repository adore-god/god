<h1>Ezekiel 17: The Eagle and The Vine</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Ezekiel 17:1-10 seems puzzling at first glance, with its imagery of a great eagle, a vine, and a broken covenant. When understood through the lens of Neville Goddard's <strong><a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Law of Assumption</a></strong>, however, this passage takes on significance. Let’s break it down and see what lessons we can learn from this ancient text.</p>
<h3><strong>The Riddle of Ezekiel 17:1-10</strong></h3>
<p>In the passage, the prophet Ezekiel presents a riddle involving a great eagle, a vine, and an unfolding story of broken promises and misplaced trust:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The first eagle</strong> (symbolising the king of Babylon) takes a seed from a land (Judah), plants it in fertile soil, and it grows into a strong vine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the vine (Judah) then turns its roots toward the second eagle (Egypt), breaking its covenant with the first eagle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vine fails to prosper because it seeks support from the second eagle, a symbol of conflicting assumptions or beliefs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Neville Goddard's framework, these elements come to life as symbols of inner states of consciousness, the power of assumptions, and the potential consequences when we lose sight of our original creative direction.</p>
<h3><strong>Breaking Down Ezekiel 17:9-10</strong></h3>
<p>The last verses of the riddle, <strong>Ezekiel 17:9-10</strong>, are particularly revealing. They read:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ezekiel 17:9</strong>: "Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Will it thrive? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers? All its new growth will wither. It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots.'"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ezekiel 17:10</strong>: "It has been planted, but will it thrive? Will it not wither completely when the east wind strikes it—wither away in the plot where it grew?'"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s unpack these verses in light of Neville's teachings:</p>
<h4><strong>The Vine’s Growth: Will It Thrive?</strong></h4>
<p>The vine in this passage symbolizes a person’s state of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>—what you assume to be true about yourself and your circumstances. According to Neville, the vine is the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html"><strong>assumption</strong> that has been planted in fertile soil—your imagination</a>. When you consistently assume a particular state, it will grow and begin to manifest in your external world.</p>
<p>However, just as the vine faces the possibility of being uprooted and withering, <a href="genesis-126-man.html">your assumptions</a> can either thrive or fail based on their consistency. If your assumptions are in harmony with your desire and maintained with persistence, they will bear fruit. But if the assumptions are weak or inconsistent, they will "wither." <a href="tossed-by-wind-symbolism.html">James talks about 'being tossed about with by the wind'</a> as being double minded and lacking stability of mind. Being bounced around by multi-directional gusts of thought.</p><p><br></p>
<h4><strong>The Withering of New Growth</strong></h4>
<p>The passage says, "All its new growth will wither," referring to the loss of progress or potential manifestation when the person’s assumption wavers. New growth represents <strong>new assumptions</strong>—the seeds you plant in your imagination about your desired reality. But when you allow doubts, negative thoughts, or external circumstances to interfere, this new growth will fail to mature.</p>
<p>In Neville’s terms, this is the danger of <strong>inconsistent assumptions</strong>. To manifest a desire, you must persist in your assumption, undeterred by external factors. If you let doubts creep in or shift your focus, the growth (manifestation) you have been nurturing will wither.</p>
<h4><strong>No External Force Can Change the Outcome</strong></h4>
<p>The next part of the verse says, "It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots." This highlights that it is not external forces that dictate the outcome of your manifestation, but rather <strong>your internal state</strong>—your assumptions. It’s not the world or other people that can determine your success; it’s your imagination and your faith in it that shape your reality.</p>
<p>Neville often stressed that <strong>nothing can stop you</strong> except your own wavering beliefs. It’s not about the external struggles you face, but the internal conflict between your assumptions and your doubts. If you remain steadfast in your assumptions, no external challenge can uproot your desire.</p>
<h4><strong>The East Wind: External Challenges and Doubts</strong></h4>
<p>The "east wind" in the passage is an important symbol. It represents external challenges, doubts, or influences that threaten your assumptions. In Neville’s view, the east wind is a metaphor for <strong>outside circumstances</strong> or <strong>negative thoughts</strong> that test your faith and commitment to your desired state.</p>
<p>When the "east wind strikes," it’s akin to facing adversity or shifting focus toward external problems. This is a pivotal moment when many people falter—they abandon their assumption because of the challenges they face. But as Neville teaches, <strong>external challenges do not dictate your outcome</strong>. The true power lies within you to remain faithful to your original assumption and ignore the distractions that threaten to sway you from your desired outcome.</p>
<h3><strong>Neville Goddard’s Interpretation of the Vine’s Symbolism</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard's teachings, the vine represents <strong>the manifestation of your desires</strong>—rooted in your <strong>imagination</strong> and nurtured by your <strong>persistent assumptions</strong>. Just as the vine is nourished by the soil, your assumptions are nurtured by the fertile ground of your imagination.</p>
<p>However, the vine’s failure to thrive when it shifts its roots toward Egypt speaks to the consequences of <strong>shifting your focus</strong> away from your true, original desire. When you place your trust in external sources—symbolized by Egypt in this case—instead of staying rooted in your assumption, your manifestations will struggle. This is a reminder that your internal state must remain consistent, and your assumptions must be unwavering.</p>
<p>In Neville's view, you <strong>cannot serve two masters</strong>. The vine's turn towards Egypt shows the conflict between different beliefs or assumptions—one aligned with your original desire, the other with external distractions or doubts. This internal conflict creates disharmony and hinders the manifestation process.</p>
<p>The key lesson here is that you must remain <strong>faithful</strong> to your assumption, no matter what external circumstances arise. The moment you allow doubts or external beliefs to distract you, your manifestation will begin to wither, much like the vine in Ezekiel 17.</p>
<h3><strong>What This Teaches Us About Manifestation</strong></h3>
<p>The riddle of Ezekiel 17 is more than a historical prophecy—it’s a <strong>lesson in manifestation</strong>. Through Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption, we understand that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistency of Assumption is Key</strong>: Just like the vine’s growth depends on its consistent roots in fertile soil, your desired manifestation depends on your unwavering belief in the assumption you’ve made. The more consistently you assume your desired state, the more likely it will manifest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>External Forces Are Not the Problem</strong>: The "east wind" and the shifting focus to Egypt show that external circumstances only have power over your manifestation if you give them permission to do so. Your assumptions, when consistently held, will dictate your reality. Don’t let outside influences—be they fears, doubts, or distractions—steer you off course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faith in Your Assumptions</strong>: To thrive, your assumptions must be nurtured and unwavering. Just as the vine withers when it shifts focus or encounters external doubt, your manifestation will falter if you don’t maintain the faith in your desired outcome.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Ezekiel 17’s riddle teaches a lesson about the nature of manifestation. The vine’s fate—whether it thrives or withers—depends on its connection to its roots (assumptions) and the external forces it allows to sway it. To manifest successfully, stay rooted in your assumptions, remain unwavering despite external challenges, and trust in the power of your imagination. Through this process, you can avoid the pitfalls of doubt and ensure your manifestation grows strong, vibrant, and fruitful.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
