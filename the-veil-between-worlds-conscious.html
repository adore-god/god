<h1>The Veil: Unrecognised Imagination</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the Bible is not a historical record but a map of your mind. Every story shows how your <a href="elohim-god.html">conscious thoughts and your imagination work together</a> to shape reality.</p><p>One of the symbols hiding the connection between this union is the <strong><a href="the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">veil</a></strong>.</p><hr><h2>The Veil in the Temple</h2><p>The veil in <a href="the-veil-of-temple-barrier-between.html">Solomon’s Temple</a> (2 Chronicles 3:14) separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. Neville explained that the <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">temple is your head</a>, and the veil is the mental barrier between your conscious self and imagination.</p><p>When Jesus dies, the veil tears from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51). This moment symbolises the end of separation — the realisation that imagination is divine, creative, and one with your conscious assumptions.</p><hr><h2>Woman as the Symbol of Imagination</h2><p>In Genesis 2:23, <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a> is called “bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,” showing she manifests from <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man's</a> self-perception. Genesis 2:24 says, “Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”</p><p>This symbolises the union of <a href="genesis-224-love.html">conscious mind and imagination </a>— leaving old ways of thinking and cleaving to a new inner state. When united, they become “one flesh,” bringing forth a new outer reality.</p><hr><h2>Moses and the Partially Veiled Light</h2><p>After encountering God, Moses’s face shines so brightly that he must veil it (Exodus 34:33). This symbolises the overwhelming brilliance of truth. Our imagination is divine, but until we are ready, we veil it — packaging it into doctrine or dismissing it as fantasy. Yet the light never fades; it waits beneath the covering until we are prepared to embody it fully.</p><hr><h2>Rebekah: The Hidden Imagination</h2><p>When Rebekah sees Isaac, she veils herself (Genesis 24:65). This shows imagination turning inward — a desire hidden within, covered from the world, and nurtured in feeling. Only through this hidden union can the desired state be born into the outer world.</p><hr><h2>Tamar: The Creative Power in Waiting</h2><p><a href="tamah-judah-and-perez.html">Tamar</a> stands for the creative power of imagination that has been set aside. She is veiled, waiting quietly, not active on her own. Her “widowhood” shows imagination without direction, left waiting because Judah (the conscious mind) delays fully embracing the Law of Assumption.</p><p>Judah hesitates to give Tamar to his son out of fear. This is the mind’s hesitation to fully commit to a new state. But even a small shift in Judah’s direction (his journey to Timnah) is enough to call imagination forward.</p><p>At Enaim (“openings” or “eyes”), Tamar sits at the entrance, symbolising imagination ready to meet the conscious mind’s new assumption. Judah gives Tamar his seal, cord, and staff — signs of his “I AM” — unconsciously committing to a new identity.</p><p>Later, when Tamar is found "pregnant" Judah is shocked but must acknowledge what has happened. This is the mind realising imagination has already acted on the assumption. Tamar’s son Perez (“breakthrough”) symbolises the sudden manifestation that appears even from hesitant beginnings.</p><hr><h2>The Tearing of the Veil: The Final Union</h2>
<blockquote> 
We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain,
where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek." — Hebrews 6:19-20
</blockquote>
<p>The tearing of the temple veil shows there is no longer a barrier between the conscious mind and imagination. When you understand this, you realise your imagination is God in action. You no longer see it as separate or passive — it becomes your living creative power.</p><hr><h2>Conclusion: Living Beyond the Veil</h2><p>The veil is not just a curtain; it is the mental separation between what you consciously think and what you allow your imagination to create.</p><p>To “tear the veil” is to unite these two, becoming “one flesh” (Genesis 2:24) with your chosen state. When imagination fully receives your assumption, a new reality is born.</p><p>The stories of Rebekah and Tamar show imagination’s quiet readiness to respond and create, even if the conscious mind hesitates. When you recognise imagination as your hidden, fertile power, you step into true mastery — knowing every new state is the child of this sacred inner marriage.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
