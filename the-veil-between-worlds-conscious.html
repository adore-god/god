<h1>The Veil: Unrecognised Imagination</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Neville Goddard&rsquo;s teachings, the Bible is not a historical record but a map of your mind. Every story shows how your <a href="elohim-god.html">conscious thoughts and your imagination work together</a> to shape reality.</p><p>One of the symbols hiding the connection between this union is the&nbsp;<strong><a href="the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">veil</a></strong>.</p><hr/><h2>The Veil in the Temple</h2><p>The veil in <a href="the-veil-of-temple-barrier-between.html">Solomon&rsquo;s Temple</a> (2 Chronicles 3:14) separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. Neville explained that the <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">temple is your head</a>, and the veil is the mental barrier between your conscious self and imagination.</p><p>When Jesus dies, the veil tears from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51). This moment symbolises the end of separation &mdash; the realisation that imagination is divine, creative, and one with your conscious assumptions.</p><hr/><h2>Woman as the Symbol of Imagination</h2><p>In Genesis 2:23, <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a> is called &ldquo;bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,&rdquo; showing she manifests from <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man's</a>&nbsp;self-perception. Genesis 2:24 says, &ldquo;Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.&rdquo;</p><p>This symbolises the union of <a href="genesis-224-love.html">conscious mind and imagination </a>&mdash; leaving old ways of thinking and cleaving to a new inner state. When united, they become &ldquo;one flesh,&rdquo; bringing forth a new outer reality.</p><hr/><h2>Moses and the Partially Veiled Light</h2><p>After encountering God, Moses&rsquo;s face shines so brightly that he must veil it (Exodus 34:33). This symbolises the overwhelming brilliance of truth. Our imagination is divine, but until we are ready, we veil it &mdash; packaging it into doctrine or dismissing it as fantasy. Yet the light never fades; it waits beneath the covering until we are prepared to embody it fully.</p><hr/><h2>Rebekah: The Hidden Imagination</h2><p>When Rebekah sees Isaac, she veils herself (Genesis 24:65). This shows imagination turning inward &mdash; a desire hidden within, covered from the world, and nurtured in feeling. Only through this hidden union can the desired state be born into the outer world.</p><hr/><h2>Tamar: The Creative Power in Waiting</h2><p><a href="tamah-judah-and-perez.html">Tamar</a> stands for the creative power of imagination that has been set aside. She is veiled, waiting quietly, not active on her own. Her &ldquo;widowhood&rdquo; shows imagination without direction, left waiting because Judah (the conscious mind) delays fully embracing the Law of Assumption.</p><p>Judah hesitates to give Tamar to his son out of fear. This is the mind&rsquo;s hesitation to fully commit to a new state. But even a small shift in Judah&rsquo;s direction (his journey to Timnah) is enough to call imagination forward.</p><p>At Enaim (&ldquo;openings&rdquo; or &ldquo;eyes&rdquo;), Tamar sits at the entrance, symbolising imagination ready to meet the conscious mind&rsquo;s new assumption. Judah gives Tamar his seal, cord, and staff &mdash; signs of his &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; &mdash; unconsciously committing to a new identity.</p><p>Later, when Tamar is found "pregnant" Judah is shocked but must acknowledge what has happened. This is the mind realising imagination has already acted on the assumption. Tamar&rsquo;s son Perez (&ldquo;breakthrough&rdquo;) symbolises the sudden manifestation that appears even from hesitant beginnings.</p><hr/><h2>The Tearing of the Veil: The Final Union</h2>
<blockquote> 
We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain,
where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek." &mdash; Hebrews 6:19-20
</blockquote>
<p>The tearing of the temple veil shows there is no longer a barrier between the conscious mind and imagination. When you understand this, you realise your imagination is God in action. You no longer see it as separate or passive &mdash; it becomes your living creative power.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion: Living Beyond the Veil</h2><p>The veil is not just a curtain; it is the mental separation between what you consciously think and what you allow your imagination to create.</p><p>To &ldquo;tear the veil&rdquo; is to unite these two, becoming &ldquo;one flesh&rdquo; (Genesis 2:24) with your chosen state. When imagination fully receives your assumption, a new reality is born.</p><p>The stories of Rebekah and Tamar show imagination&rsquo;s quiet readiness to respond and create, even if the conscious mind hesitates. When you recognise imagination as your hidden, fertile power, you step into true mastery &mdash; knowing every new state is the child of this sacred inner marriage.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
