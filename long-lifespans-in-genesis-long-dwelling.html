<h1>Long Lifespans in Genesis: Long Dwelling in Old States of Mind </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In the early chapters of Genesis, we encounter figures like Adam, Methuselah, and Noah living for hundreds upon hundreds of years. Adam is said to have lived 930 years; Methuselah famously reached 969; Noah, 950. To the literal-minded reader, these numbers appear implausible and often become a stumbling block. Yet, as Neville Goddard teaches, the Bible is not a historical record but a psychological drama — a symbolic map of consciousness.</p><p>When we approach these long lifespans through Neville’s understanding, a richer meaning emerges, one that resonates deeply with the law of assumption and the creative power of imagination.</p><h3>Beyond Biology: Ages as States of Consciousness</h3><p>According to Neville, every character in the Bible symbolises a particular state of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> or an aspect of our own inner world. The "ages" assigned to these patriarchs do not describe physical years but rather the <strong>duration and strength of certain mental states or assumptions</strong>.</p><p>A character’s great age is a symbolic way of saying that a particular state of mind has dominated for an exceedingly long time. In the language of the law of assumption, it describes the <strong>longevity of a belief or assumption that has been consistently entertained</strong> — often so deeply ingrained that it feels "eternal" within us.</p><h3>The Endurance of Assumptions</h3><p>The ages hint at how tenacious and enduring certain states can be. An assumption, whether positive or negative, lives as long as it is sustained by our inner acceptance of it. In other words, a belief can persist for "900 years" in symbolic terms — meaning it has shaped your reality for as long as you have consented to it mentally.</p><p>These ancient figures show us that certain patterns and perceptions can feel ageless and immovable, until we choose to "die" to them by assuming a new state.</p><h3>Ripeness and the Necessity of Death</h3><p>In biblical symbolism, a long life often suggests <strong>maturity or completion of a cycle</strong>. A state must reach its full expression before it can "die" and give way to something new. Neville frequently emphasised that to step into a new state, we must be willing to let the old one "die", regardless of how deeply entrenched it has become.</p><p>The enormous ages therefore represent the full ripening of an assumption — the point at which it is finally ready to be released.</p><h3>Time in Imagination</h3><p>Neville insisted that creation is finished and all states already exist. In imagination, time is not linear. The apparent "age" of a state in Genesis points to the vast, seemingly timeless nature of certain assumptions. A belief might persist for decades or feel as if it has lasted lifetimes, yet in imagination, it can be shifted in a moment by assuming a new idea.</p><h3>Illustrations from Genesis</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adam (930 years)</strong> symbolises the initial awareness of separation — the sense of "I am separate from God". This state lingers deeply in human consciousness, shaping our sense of lack and struggle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Methuselah (969 years)</strong> represents a particularly entrenched or all-encompassing belief. It lives "longer than all", becoming the most dominant pattern of thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Noah (950 years)</strong> stands for refuge, the inner ark that saves us from emotional storms and floods of negativity. The longevity here reminds us that our capacity for inner refuge is always present, even if we rarely acknowledge it.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr><h2>The Shift Towards Immediacy</h2><p>As the biblical narrative unfolds, something remarkable happens. The emphasis shifts from extreme longevity to <strong>immediacy, swiftness, and quickness</strong>.</p><p>By the time we reach the New Testament, we encounter Jesus declaring, <em>"Behold, I come quickly."</em> In the Gospel of Mark especially, the word <em>"immediately"</em> (or <em>"straightway"</em>) appears repeatedly. This is not simply a literary style — it is a profound psychological statement about the nature of manifestation and the readiness of consciousness to shift states rapidly.</p><p>In the early stories, states of consciousness appear to endure "forever" before they are replaced. But with the coming of Jesus (the personification of awakened imagination and fulfilment), the narrative urges us to <strong>embrace the immediacy of transformation</strong>.</p><p>No longer must we remain in a state for symbolic "900 years". Instead, we are invited to claim our new state now, in this instant. The same creative power that seemed so slow and ancient in Genesis is shown to be <em>instantaneous</em> when understood and rightly assumed.</p><hr><h2>The Message for Us</h2><p>When we understand these long lifespans as symbolic, they become powerful teachings rather than historical oddities. They reveal that we are always living under the reign of a state — an assumption — which can feel unchangeable simply because we have not yet chosen to assume otherwise.</p><p>Neville’s law of assumption teaches that by persistently assuming the feeling of our wish fulfilled, we can dissolve even the most ancient, Methuselah-like patterns. The "death" of these old states is not tragic but necessary for new life to emerge.</p><p>Yet ultimately, the Bible invites us beyond the slow, age-old process into a realisation of <strong>immediacy</strong> — that consciousness can move as swiftly as we dare to accept it.</p><hr><p><strong>In short, the long lives of the early patriarchs symbolise the enduring nature of entrenched assumptions, while the New Testament calls us into the immediacy of transformation. At any moment, you have the power to shift your state and reveal a new world — not in centuries, but instantly.</strong></p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-time-series.html" class="noTag">Time Series</a></p>
