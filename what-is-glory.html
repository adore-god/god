<h1>What Is Glory?</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Neville Goddard’s work, <strong>glory </strong>is the <b><a href="elohim-god.html">vivid expression of God revealed through human consciousness</a>, </b>the moment when the inner world of imagination takes on tangible form and your <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">invisible assumption is clothed in reality</a>.</p><p>Glory can be understood symbolically through several rich perspectives in Neville’s teachings.</p><p>Glory is the inner light of awareness piercing the shell of doubt and limitation. Like the sun bursting through heavy clouds, what was once hidden by fear or disbelief now radiates as fulfilled desire.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Glory is the light of awareness clothed in the garment of form.”<br/>
<em>“Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you.”</em> — Isaiah 60:1</p>
</blockquote><p>Just as a seed enfolds the blueprint of a tree, your <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">imagination contains the pattern of your reality.</a> Through faithful persistence—nourishing the assumption with feeling and belief—this hidden potential unfolds outwardly. Glory is not something added; it is revealed from within.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow.”</em> — 1 Corinthians 3:6</p>
</blockquote><p>To behold glory is to awaken to a profound truth:</p><blockquote>
<p>“I and my Father are one.”</p></blockquote>This is not an intellectual idea, but a felt experience of unity. Glory arises when the <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">outer world mirrors your inner certainty of being the creative power itself</a>.<blockquote><p>
<em>“And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory.”</em> — 2 Corinthians 3:18</p>
</blockquote><p>Glory is the faithful response of reality to your <a href="genesis-224-love.html">inner conviction</a>. When you persist in imagining your desire despite contrary appearances, the world eventually echoes back your belief as lived experience. Glory is this visible affirmation of faith.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.”</em> — Hebrews 11:1</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville emphasised, “All things exist; there is no creating, only revealing.” Glory is the moment the <a href="the-veil-of-temple-barrier-between.html">veil lifts</a>, and what existed only in imagination steps forth boldly, declaring, “Here I AM.”</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“We fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.”</em> — 2 Corinthians 4:18</p>
</blockquote><p>To <a href="genesis-224-love.html">live in imagination and persist until it externalises is to live for the glory of God</a>—not as something distant, but as the divine spark becoming form through you.</p><hr/><h3>What Neville Goddard Said About Glory</h3><p>Neville often described glory as the <strong>manifestation of the divine presence through human consciousness</strong>—the concrete expression of your assumptions made real. It is a state where the invisible and eternal realm of imagination intersects perfectly with the temporal world. He taught that glory is not something to be earned externally but is the natural byproduct of fully inhabiting and believing your inner reality</p><div class="share-dropdown">
