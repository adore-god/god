<h1>Joseph: The Birth of Jesus</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>

<p>Forget the school nativity play. The <a href="the-virgin-birth-of-love.html">birth of Jesus</a> in Matthew 1:18–25 is not a literal event but a precise psychological process. For Neville Goddard, the Bible records the awakening of consciousness within the individual.</p>

<p>The <a href="the-virgin-birth-of-love.html">virgin birth</a> represents the moment a new psychological ability emerges — a state assumed inwardly, without evidence, reason, or permission from the outer world. This is the Law of Assumption in action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way..." (Matthew 1:18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="biblical-archetypes-of-feminine.html">Mary symbolises the <strong>responsive mind disciplined in devotion to the I AM</strong></a>. She is not easily seduced by appearances, emotions, or outer persuasion — unlike Jezebel or Delilah, who represent reactive or undisciplined thought. Only a mind trained to respond to imagination rather than circumstance can conceive the Christ.</p>

<p>Mary is “with child by the Holy Spirit.” This is not external intervention but the inner acceptance of the imaginal act. The Holy Spirit represents the <strong>spirit of mind</strong> — the transient, flowing nature of thought that, when disciplined, brings wholeness. Ideas appear, move, and settle, and when aligned with the I AM, they become sustaining forces within consciousness.</p>


<p>This aligns with <a class="noTag" href="genesis-224-love.html">Genesis 2:24: LOVE</a>:
</p> 
<blockquote>“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”
</blockquote> 
<p> 
Leaving father and mother symbolises departing from inherited patterns, old beliefs, and reactive consciousness. Joseph nearly “divorced” Mary when doubt challenged the miraculous assumption within her — representing the temptation to reject a state that defies outer appearances. Yet he returned to sustain her as a wife, nurturing the new assumption until it fully manifested. True inner union requires leaving the old and committing to the new, allowing imagination to birth reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man and not wishing to make her a public example, thought to set her free quietly." (Matthew 1:19)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph</a>, whose name means “to increase,” represents the faculty that nurtures and expands an assumed state. In <a href="the-cup-of-destiny-josephs-divination.html">Genesis, he brings abundance during famine by reconciling opposing aspects of mind</a> — fear and trust, lack and provision, memory and imagination. Here, he reappears and protects and sustains the new psychological ability until it can express outwardly. To “set her free quietly” means not exposing the imaginal act to doubt or logic.</p>

<blockquote>
"But when he was giving thought to these things, an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, have no fear of taking Mary as your wife; for that which is in her is of the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 1:20)
</blockquote>

<p>The angel represents higher intuition. Joseph is told not to fear, confirming his impulse to protect rather than reject the inner birth. Being “righteous” means he is aligned with the Law of Assumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And she will give birth to a son; and you will give him the name Jesus; for he will save his people from their sins." (Matthew 1:21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus (Yeshua) means “salvation</a>.” This is the emergence of a psychological ability — the development of the <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">beloved David</a> within, moving away from the old state symbolised by Saul. This ability moves through the mind, transforming it, and “saving” every part of consciousness. <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Sin is not moral wrongdoing</a> but “missing the mark” — failing to assume the state you desire.</p>

<p>Naming the child is claiming the new ability consciously. The mind that assumes (Mary) and the mind that nurtures and expands the assumption (Joseph) unite to birth a living psychological reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"See, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Emmanuel." (Matthew 1:23)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emmanuel, meaning “God with us,” signifies that <a href="elohim-god.html">imagination is present and alive</a>. Each time the responsive mind remains loyal to an unseen assumption despite doubt, delay, or temptation (the Jezebels and Delilahs of consciousness), this prophecy is fulfilled.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him." (Matthew 1:24–25)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By taking Mary as his wife and naming the child, Joseph aligns fully with the subconscious faculty. Together, they allow the inner assumption — the new psychological ability — to be born into experience. This is the repeatable moment when consciousness shifts, a new state is assumed, and the mind begins to save itself from old limitations.</p>
