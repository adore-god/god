<h1>Joseph: The Birth of Jesus</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Try and forget the school nativity play here. The story of Jesus&rsquo; birth in Matthew 1:18&ndash;25, often understood as a literal event, unfolds into a transformative drama when seen through Neville Goddard&rsquo;s symbolic insight. For Neville, the Bible is not a record of external history but a psychological enactment happening within each of us. In this passage, the <a href="the-many-faces-of-subconscious-women-of.html">virgin</a> conception is not about biology; it is about the <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">birth of awakened imagination within the individual.</a></p><blockquote>
<p>"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way..." (Matthew 1:18)</p></blockquote>In Neville&rsquo;s interpretation, Mary symbolises the subconscious mind &mdash; that fertile ground where ideas planted by imagination take root and grow into reality. She is found to be &ldquo;with child by the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; showing that her pregnancy arises from a psychological shift. This represents the <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a> of imagination taking root within.<p>The Holy Spirit is the <a href="elohim-god.html">active power of God</a>: the imagination itself. When an idea is deeply felt and accepted as true, it is as though the subconscious has conceived it. The resulting &ldquo;child&rdquo; does not come through logic or outer effort but through inner acceptance and conviction.</p><blockquote>
<p>"And Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man and not wishing to make her a public example, thought to set her free quietly." (Matthew 1:19)<br/>
Joseph, whose name means &ldquo;to increase,&rdquo; symbolises an aspect of self aligned with growth and expansion&mdash;the &ldquo;righteous man&rdquo; who is in harmony with the law of assumption. He recognises the sacredness of the subconscious conception and chooses to &ldquo;set her free quietly&rdquo;&mdash;not to reject or shame Mary (the subconscious), but to protect and keep her safe. This act symbolises the self&rsquo;s desire to preserve and nurture the inner birth process without disturbance or public exposure.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"But when he was giving thought to these things, an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, have no fear of taking Mary as your wife; for that which is in her is of the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 1:20)<br/>
The angel in the dream represents higher intuition&mdash;divine guidance from within. Joseph is told not to fear, confirming that his impulse to protect rather than condemn was correct.</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the message is clear: do not interfere with the work of imagination simply because it defies logic. Embrace the process without fear. Joseph being a <i>righteous</i> man is Joseph aligned with the law of Assumption.</p><blockquote>
<p>"And she will give birth to a son; and you will give him the name Jesus; for he will give his people salvation from their sins." (Matthew 1:21)<br/>
The name Jesus (Yeshua) means &ldquo;salvation.&rdquo; In Neville&rsquo;s interpretation, salvation is not an external rescue but an inner transformation.</p>
</blockquote><p>Sin, in this view, is not moral wrongdoing but &ldquo;missing the mark&rdquo;&mdash;failing to assume the state you truly desire to be in.</p><p>To name the child <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus is to acknowledge that salvation arises from within</a>. It is the realisation of your creative power&mdash;that by changing your inner assumptions, you change your entire world.</p><blockquote>
<p>"Now all this took place so that the word of the Lord by the prophet might come true, saying," (Matthew 1:22)<br/>
"See, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will give him the name Emmanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us." (Matthew 1:23)<br/>
This prophecy is not about predicting external events but revealing an eternal principle: that the subconscious (the virgin) can give birth to reality without external aid.</p>
</blockquote><p>Each time you dare to believe in the unseen&mdash;to assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled&mdash;this prophecy is fulfilled.</p><p>Emmanuel, meaning &ldquo;<a href="elohim-god.html">God with us</a>,&rdquo; signifies the profound truth that God is not distant or separate but is your own wonderful human imagination. God is truly with you, as you.</p><blockquote>
<p>"And Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had said to him, and took her as his wife;" (Matthew 1:24)<br/>
"And he had no connection with her till she had given birth to a son; and he gave him the name Jesus." (Matthew 1:25)<br/>
When Joseph names the child, he is not merely assigning a label. In biblical symbolism, to name is to give life, to affirm and embody a new reality.</p>
</blockquote><p>By accepting the angel&rsquo;s message and naming the child Jesus, Joseph (the increasing self) aligns completely with Mary (the subconscious). This union allows the inner assumption to become a living expression&mdash;to be "born" into the outer world.</p><p>This is the moment of full inner union: the imaginal act is complete, the state of consciousness has shifted, and a new reality has emerged.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
