<h1>States of Consciousness in Scripture: Jew, Gentile, and Greek According to Neville Goddard</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><strong>Note to the Reader</strong></p><p>
This post explores the symbolic meaning behind the biblical terms <em>Jew</em>, <em>Gentile</em>, and <em>Greek</em> as interpreted through the psychological teachings of Neville Goddard. These names are not references to ethnicity, religion, or nationality, but to inner states of consciousness. This reading of Scripture is inward and metaphorical, and is in no way connected to current global events or political realities.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Bible, through Neville’s eyes, is a record of psychological states—stories and characters representing aspects of the inner man. These symbolic states shift and evolve as we awaken to the truth that imagination creates reality. In this framework, <em>Jew</em>, <em>Gentile</em>, and <em>Greek</em> each represent distinct conditions of human consciousness.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Jew: The Inner Law-Keeper Who Still Looks for a Sign</strong></h3>
<p>To be a <em>Jew</em>, according to Neville, is to symbolise an awakened state. This person has discovered that reality is formed from within, through imagination, rather than by reacting to the world of appearances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter…"</strong><br>
<em>(Romans 2:29)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The awakened Jew understands that their assumption of identity (<em>I AM</em>) determines experience. They live by faith in the unseen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM…"</strong><br>
<em>(Exodus 3:14)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Paul makes an interesting point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"For the Jews require a sign…"</strong><br>
<em>(1 Corinthians 1:22)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Neville’s symbolic framework, this means that even the awakened mind can fall into the temptation of seeking outward proof before fully believing. This state says, <em>“I will believe it when I see it”</em>, rather than living from the inner conviction: <em>“I will see it because I believe it.”</em></p>
<p>This is the paradox of the inner Jew: knowing the truth but wavering in practice—still looking for confirmation from the outer world rather than resting in inner certainty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbolic meaning</strong>: An awakened consciousness that knows imagination creates reality, yet may still seek visible signs before fully trusting.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Gentile: The Outer Law-Follower</strong></h3>
<p>The <em>Gentile</em> represents the unawakened man—one who believes entirely in the outer world and its circumstances. They live by appearances and logic. They trust in facts, not imagination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"That at that time ye were without Christ… having no hope, and without God in the world"</strong><br>
<em>(Ephesians 2:12)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus also speaks of this reactive mindset:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"For after all these things do the Gentiles seek…"</strong><br>
<em>(Matthew 6:32)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, they are consumed with the world’s questions: What shall I eat? What shall I wear? Their sense of identity is bound to external evidence, unaware that all change begins within.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbolic meaning</strong>: A reactive, outer-directed consciousness, disconnected from inner causation.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Greek: The Intellectual Rationaliser</strong></h3>
<p>The <em>Greek</em>, in Neville’s terms, stands for the thinking mind—one who loves theory and logic, but resists personal transformation. The Greek seeks to explain the mystery rather than enter it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"The Greeks seek after wisdom…"</strong><br>
<em>(1 Corinthians 1:22)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This state values philosophy, but often avoids imagination—the childlike quality required to <em>assume the wish fulfilled</em>. The Greek prefers analysis to action, ideas to embodiment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"</strong><br>
<em>(1 Corinthians 1:20)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To move beyond the Greek is to let go of intellectual pride and embrace inner conviction—the creative act of imagining boldly, without needing to explain how.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbolic meaning</strong>: The intellectual consciousness that studies truth but hesitates to live it inwardly.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Unity Beyond the Divide</strong></h3>
<p>The Bible ultimately leads us beyond all divisions of identity. These symbolic labels are not fixed roles but passing phases in the soul’s evolution. As Paul reminds us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"There is neither Jew nor Greek… for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."</strong><br>
<em>(Galatians 3:28)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Christ</em> in this case is your awakened imagination—the divine creative power in man. Every soul is on its way to discovering this power, and in that discovery, the outer distinctions fall away.</p>
