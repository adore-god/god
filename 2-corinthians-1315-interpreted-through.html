<h1>2 Corinthians 13:1–5 Interpreted Through Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Paul writes, <em><b>“In the mouth of two or three witnesses will every word be made certain.”</b></em> (v.1) Neville Goddard taught that your inner world determines your outer reality. An assumption becomes fact when it is confirmed by three “<b>witnesses</b>” within: <b>imagination (mind), feeling (heart), and sustained action (body).</b> These inner faculties must agree—when you think from the state of your wish fulfilled, feel it to be true, and persist in that state, it hardens into reality. This is how every word (or desire) is established.</p>
<p>Paul then warns, <em><b>“If I come again, I will not be kind.”</b></em> (v.2) This can be seen symbolically as the inner Christ—the deeper self—returning with greater intensity when we resist change. If we keep assuming from an old state, the consequences return stronger. It’s not punishment, but a push towards awareness. Your outer world reflects your dominant inner assumptions, and until you revise them, they persist.</p>
<p>He continues,<b> <em>“You are looking for a sign of Christ who is in me…”</em></b> (v.3) But Christ, Neville insisted, is not someone outside you. Christ is your own wonderful human imagination. The power you seek is not external—it's already within. Stop searching for proof in the world and instead assume the inner truth of your desire.</p>
<p>Verse 4 says,<b> <em>“He was put to death on the cross in feebleness, but is living by the power of God.”</em></b> Neville often said the crucifixion symbolises the fixation of an idea in imagination. What seems weak—daydreaming, imagining—is the divine creative act. The resurrection is your assumption brought to life. It is your new state made visible through faith.</p>
<p>Finally, Paul challenges, <em><b>“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Is it not clear that Jesus Christ is in you?”</b></em> (v.5) This is the invitation to examine not your morality, but your assumptions. Are you living in faith—believing in the unseen? Are you assuming the feeling of your wish fulfilled? If not, as Paul puts it, “you are completely false”—you’re denying the divine creative power within you.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
