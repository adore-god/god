<h1>The Lord is my Shepherd</h1>
<p>Psalm 23, one of the most beloved passages in the Bible, begins with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
    The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
</blockquote>
<p>For centuries, this verse has been a source of comfort and guidance, offering a sense of peace and divine protection. However, when we interpret Psalm 23 through the lens of Neville Goddard's teachings, it takes on a deeper, empowering meaning. The Bible teaches that your <a href="genesis-126-man.html"> imagination and assumptions shape your reality</a>. Let’s explore how Psalm 23 can be understood through this transformative lens.</p>

<blockquote>
    The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
</blockquote>
<p>The "Lord" represents your higher self or imagination. Goddard teaches that your imagination is the creative force of the universe and that it is through this divine imagination that all your desires come into being. When you align with your inner creative power, you will "want" for nothing because everything you need already exists within your mind. The "shepherd", as a <a href="elohim-god.html"> single entity governing many aspects</a> reflects the nature of God, and is the guiding force of your thoughts and beliefs, leading you to the fulfilment of your desires.</p>

<blockquote>
    He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
</blockquote>
<p>Green pastures and still waters symbolise peace, abundance, and rest. Goddard encourages you to visualise a peaceful life, knowing that your mind is the source of all good that flows into your reality. By imagining a life filled with abundance, peace, and joy, you can manifest this into your reality.</p>

<blockquote>
    He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
</blockquote>
<p>"Restoring the soul" refers to transforming your mind, replacing negative beliefs with positive assumptions. "Righteousness" refers to walking in alignment with your highest ideals by imagining your desires as already fulfilled. The phrase "for his name’s sake" refers to aligning with your true identity — the creative power within you. By continuing to imagine a life of goodness and success, you restore your mind and walk in empowerment.</p>

<blockquote>
    Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
</blockquote>
<p>Life’s challenges are illusions, created by negative thoughts or doubts. When you choose to believe in your desired outcome, you can face any challenge without fear. The "rod and staff" represent the power of your imagination and faith to guide and comfort you. The "valley of the shadow of death" symbolises obstacles or fears that seem real, but are merely illusions. By persistently imagining your desires fulfilled, you walk through challenges with confidence, knowing that the tools of imagination and faith will guide you.</p>

<blockquote>
    Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
</blockquote>
<p>The "table" represents the abundance and opportunities that are available to you, regardless of opposition. The "anointing with oil" is a symbol of empowerment and being chosen by your own consciousness. "My cup runneth over" reflects the overflowing abundance that results from persisting in positive imagination. This verse suggests that blessings come even in the face of opposition, and that your inner creative power ensures your success, no matter what external forces may suggest.</p>

<blockquote>
    Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
</blockquote>
<p>"Goodness and mercy" are the positive results of your assumptions. When you align your thoughts with what you desire, these things inevitably follow you. The "house of the Lord" refers to a state of mind — a mental state of abundance, peace, and love that lasts forever. By continuing to imagine and believe in the best, you create a life that reflects your highest ideals. The "house of the Lord" is a permanent state of consciousness — one of peace, abundance, and love.</p>
