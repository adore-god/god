<h1>Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife: Resisting The Temptation and Pull of Sensual Reality</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Genesis 39:7-12 describes a defining moment in Joseph’s story: the persistent seduction attempts by Potiphar’s <a href="genesis-224-love.html">wife</a> and Joseph’s firm refusal. Neville Goddard’s <strong>Law of Assumption</strong> provides a transformative way to understand this scene—not as a moral test but as a spiritual allegory about holding to an assumed state of being amidst temptation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Scene: Potiphar’s Wife Tempts Joseph</h2>
<p>Egypt is repeatedly used in the Bible to represent slavery, limitation, and the subconscious bondage of the mind. So, Potiphar’s Egyptian <a href="genesis-224-love.html">wife</a> represents the bondage of the outer senses and the temptations that keep the individual “in slavery” to limited thinking and external appearances.</p><p>Potiphar’s <a href="genesis-224-love.html">wife</a> repeatedly tries to lure Joseph into <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">sin</a> — that is, away from his wonderful vision. She uses her position and allure to break his integrity. Yet Joseph refuses, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How then can I do this great wickedness, and <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">sin</a> against <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a>?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph’s refusal is not just about moral uprightness but about <strong>who he assumes himself to be</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Neville’s Law of Assumption: The Creative Power of Feeling</h2>
<p>Neville teaches that <strong>imagination and feeling shape reality</strong>. The “I am” feeling—the inner state you assume as true—controls what manifests outwardly.</p>
<p>Joseph’s resistance can be understood as <strong>maintaining the feeling of his true self</strong>—faithful, loyal, and above corruption—even though external temptation is intense.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Potiphar’s Wife as External Pressure</h2>
<p>In Neville’s terms, Potiphar’s <a href="genesis-224-love.html">wife</a> represents <strong>external circumstance, pressure, and temptation</strong>, trying to break Joseph’s <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">inner assumption</a>.</p>
<p>She is the <em>challenge</em> thrown at the inner state, an invitation to assume a false or reactive identity (giving in to temptation).</p>
<p>Joseph’s inner world refuses to respond to this external narrative.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Joseph’s Inner Assumption Is Unshakable</h2>
<p>Joseph’s reply reflects his <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">unwavering inner assumption</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He does not identify with the desire or fear imposed by Potiphar’s wife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He “lives in the end,” meaning he feels and assumes his identity as faithful and loyal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the power Neville emphasises: <strong>to remain in the feeling of the wish fulfilled regardless of external provocations</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>What This Means for Us</h2>
<p>When temptation or pressure arises, the “Potiphar’s wife” moment in our lives calls for <strong>holding the assumption firmly</strong>. Neville’s teaching invites us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Refuse the outer demand to shift identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine ourselves <em>already</em> in the state of loyalty, integrity, or whichever fulfilled state we desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know that temptation is just an external scene that has no power over the inner state unless we accept it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The story of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife reveals that <strong>true power lies in the inner assumption</strong>. External seduction, pressure, or temptation is powerless when we maintain the feeling of our true fulfilled identity.</p>
<p>Joseph’s example invites us to master our inner state, for it is imagination and feeling that form reality—just as Neville Goddard teaches.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
