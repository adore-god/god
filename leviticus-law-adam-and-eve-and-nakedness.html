<h1>Leviticus Law: Nakedness</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The Bible, beyond its moral codes, reveals profound psychological truths when approached through Neville Goddard’s principle: <em><a href="genesis-111-seed.html">“Imagination creates reality.”</a></em> This principle helps us understand consciousness and the nature of creation.</p>

<p>In this article, we explore passages from <strong><a href="scrolls/label-leviticus-series.html">Leviticus</a></strong> that discuss nakedness and how they symbolise mental boundaries within consciousness. We also connect this to <strong><a class="noTag" href="genesis-224-love.html">Genesis 2:24</a></strong>, where man is told to “leave his father and mother,” showing the symbolic movement from old states to chosen assumptions.</p>

<h3>Adam and Eve: Nakedness as Life Without Assumption</h3>
<p>Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden were initially naked and unashamed, representing a state of effortless creation, wholeness, and unity with their divine nature. After the fall, they became aware of their nakedness—symbolising the shift from divine unity to fragmented awareness. Nakedness here does not refer to physical shame but to being exposed, undefined, and at the mercy of circumstances because imagination has not been clothed in a chosen assumption.</p>

<p>From Neville’s perspective, <strong>nakedness is life without an assumption</strong>. To be clothed is to embody a chosen state of being, to live in the assumption of the wish fulfilled. Nakedness is thus a metaphor for vulnerability and limitation when imagination is unanchored.</p>

<h3>Genesis 2:24: Leaving Father and Mother</h3>
<p><strong>“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall be joined unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”</strong></p>

<p>Symbolically, the “father” represents the core sense of <em><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></em>, the source of identity, and the “mother” represents the subconscious mind, the fertile field of creation. To leave father and mother is to move beyond inherited assumptions, past conditioning, and old identities, stepping into a consciously chosen state—the “wife,” or desired assumption.</p>

<h3>Leviticus: Laws of Nakedness as Mental Boundaries</h3>
<p>Leviticus 18 presents laws forbidding sexual relations with close relatives, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father or mother”</strong> (Lev 18:7)</li>
<li><strong>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife”</strong> (Lev 18:8)</li>
</ul>

<p>Symbolically, these passages teach us not to dwell in or act from old, inherited states of consciousness. To “uncover nakedness” is to expose ourselves to limitation, to identify with lack rather than fullness.</p>

<h3>The Inner “Family” and Mental Boundaries</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Father</strong>: Awareness of being. Uncovering his nakedness fragments the “I AM,” revealing limitation instead of fullness.</li>
<li><strong>Mother</strong>: The subconscious mind. Seeing her nakedness as barren reflects misperception of creative power.</li>
<li><strong>Father’s Wife</strong>: Externalised or inherited beliefs tied to identity but not true self; relying on these keeps consciousness in separation.</li>
<li><strong>Sister</strong>: Parallel states of consciousness. Dwelling on her nakedness reinforces feelings of incompleteness within oneself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>From Law to Assumption</h3>
<p>Leviticus presents boundaries—external prohibitions that symbolise internal mental limits. Genesis 2:24 points the way forward: to leave old identifications and step into a consciously chosen assumption. Nakedness, once a state of exposure and limitation, is transformed when imagination is clothed in a desired state of being.</p>

<h3>Conclusion: Moving from Nakedness to Assumption</h3>
<p>Reading Leviticus alongside Genesis 2:24, the symbolism becomes clear. To “uncover nakedness” is to remain in limitation. To “leave father and mother” is to depart from old states entirely. By embracing assumption and leaving behind inherited identities, we step into a new state of consciousness—clothed, whole, and defined in imagination. Nakedness is thus not shame, but a call to consciously assume our desired reality.</p>
