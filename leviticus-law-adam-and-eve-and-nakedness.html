<h1>Leviticus Law: Nakedness</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The Bible, often seen as a collection of moral codes, reveals profound psychological and metaphysical truths when viewed through Neville Goddard's teachings. Through his principle that <em><a href="genesis-111-seed.html">"Imagination creates reality,"</a></em> we unlock layers of deeper meaning—guiding us to understand consciousness and the nature of creation.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll explore passages from <strong><a href="scrolls/label-leviticus-series.html">Leviticus</a></strong> about incestuous relationships and how they serve as metaphors for mental boundaries within consciousness. We’ll then connect this to <strong><a class="noTag" href="genesis-224-love.html">Genesis 2:24</a></strong>, where man is told to “leave his father and mother,” showing how uncovering or leaving ties into separating from limiting states. Along the way, we’ll interpret the symbolic meanings of figures like the <strong>father, mother, and sister</strong> as they relate to our inner world.</p>

<h3>Adam and Eve: The Fall and the State of Nakedness</h3>
<p>The story of <strong>Adam and Eve</strong> in the Garden of Eden begins with innocence and divine wholeness. They were naked, yet unashamed, symbolising effortless creation and unity with their divine nature. However, after their fall, they became aware of their nakedness. This represents the shift from divine unity to a fragmented awareness of lack. Nakedness becomes a symbol of vulnerability, exposure, and the burden of self-consciousness.</p>

<p>From Neville’s perspective, <strong>nakedness is life without an assumption</strong>. To stand unclothed in imagination is to remain undefined, at the mercy of circumstances. To be <a href="the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">metaphorically clothed</a> is to <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">live in assumption, to wear the state of the wish fulfilled</a>. Nakedness, therefore, is not shame about the body, but exposure to limitation because imagination has <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">not been clothed in a chosen identity.</a></p>

<h3>Genesis 2:24: Leaving Father and Mother</h3>
<p>Genesis 2:24 declares: <strong>“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall be joined unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”</strong></p>

<p>On the surface this speaks of marriage, but symbolically it goes deeper. The “father” represents the core sense of <em><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></em>, the source of identity. The “mother” symbolises the subconscious mind, the fertile field of creation. To <em>leave father and mother</em> is to move beyond inherited assumptions, past conditioning, and borrowed beliefs. It is a call to step out of old frameworks of identity and limitation and unite with a <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">new state of being—the “wife,” or desired assumption</a>, that makes us one with our chosen reality.</p>

<h3>Leviticus: Laws of Nakedness as Inner Boundaries</h3>
<p>In <strong>Leviticus 18</strong>, we encounter a series of laws prohibiting sexual relations with close relatives, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father or mother”</strong> (Lev 18:7)</li>
<li><strong>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife”</strong> (Lev 18:8)</li>
</ul>

<p>At face value, these are external prohibitions meant to govern behaviour. But symbolically they mirror Genesis 2:24’s principle of leaving father and mother. They teach us not to bind ourselves to old conditions of the self—ancestral thought patterns, subconscious fears, or borrowed assumptions—but to move beyond them into a new state of consciousness.</p>

<h3>The Inner “Family” and Mental Boundaries</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Father</strong>: Awareness of being. To uncover his nakedness means to fragment or limit the “I AM,” identifying with lack instead of divine fullness.</li>
<li><strong>Mother</strong>: The subconscious mind. Uncovering her nakedness is to see it as barren, rather than the fertile field of all creation.</li>
<li><strong>Father’s Wife</strong>: Inherited or externalised beliefs tied to “I AM” but not truly it. Accepting these keeps us in separation.</li>
<li><strong>Sister</strong>: Parallel states of consciousness. Dwelling on her nakedness reflects reinforcing feelings of incompleteness within ourselves.</li>
</ul>

<h3>From Law to Fulfilment: The State of Jesus</h3>
<p>Where Leviticus sets external restrictions, <strong>Genesis 2:24</strong> offers a way forward: to leave behind the old identifications and enter a conscious union with the desired state. This culminates in Neville’s teaching of the <strong>state of Jesus</strong>—the embodiment of divine wholeness, the assumption of the wish fulfilled.</p>

<p>Thus, the journey is clear: do not uncover or remain bound to the nakedness of the old (Leviticus), but leave father and mother (Genesis 2:24) and cleave to the new state of being (Jesus). Nakedness, once a symbol of shame and separation, is transformed into union and wholeness.</p>

<h3>Conclusion: Leaving, Uncovering, and Becoming One</h3>
<p>When we read Leviticus alongside Genesis 2:24, the symbolism deepens. To “uncover nakedness” is to dwell in limitation, to expose the weakness of inherited states. To “leave father and mother” is to depart from those states entirely. The contrast reveals the path from law to love, from prohibition to union, from external restraint to inner transformation.</p>

<p>By embracing assumption and consciously leaving behind old identifications, we step into the marriage of new awareness—the two becoming one flesh. In this unity, the state of Jesus, we reclaim divine wholeness and manifest the life of our choosing.</p>
