<h1>Abraham and Sarah: Change of Name</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the <strong>imagination</strong> is the creative power of God—the source of all manifestation. This perspective shifts how we view the story of <strong>Abram and Sarai</strong>. When <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> changes their names to <strong>Abraham and Sarah</strong>, He is not simply renaming them. In the realm of imagination and manifestation, this is a symbolic act of <strong>transforming their identity</strong> to align with their destined fulfilment.</p>
<p>At the heart of this transformation lies the Hebrew letter <strong>He (ה)</strong>, which is added to their names. In the <a href="the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Mathers table</a>, the letter He symbolises <strong>a window</strong>, a <strong>breath</strong>, or a <strong>portal</strong>—an opening that allows for the <strong>passage of spirit</strong>, the <strong>inflow of divine energy</strong>, and the <strong>revelation of the unseen</strong>. This is not just a linguistic alteration—it is a profound shift in consciousness.</p>
<h3>He as the Divine Breath of Imagination</h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, the breath of God is the <strong>imagination</strong>, the <strong>life force</strong> that animates our desires and brings them into being. When <strong>Abram and Sarai</strong> receive the <strong>H</strong>, they are <strong>infused with the revelation of imagination</strong>—the very <strong>power</strong> that enables them to <strong>conceive and give birth to their desire</strong>.</p>
<p>Before this, they had only the desire for a child, a promise of a future that seemed impossible. With the addition of <strong><a href="the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">H</a></strong>, they <strong>shift states of consciousness</strong>. They are no longer mere mortals hoping for a miracle—they have <strong>aligned themselves with the reality of their promise</strong>. The impossible is now <strong>manifest</strong> because they have embodied it in their imagination. This is a deep, internal change—a <strong>rebirth of self</strong>.</p>
<h3>He as a Window: Opening to New Realms of Possibility</h3>
<p>The letter He can also be understood as a <strong>window</strong>—a <strong>portal</strong> through which new <strong>awareness</strong> enters. In this sense, <strong>Abram and Sarai</strong> are being opened to a new dimension of possibility, just as we are when we <strong>expand our own state of consciousness</strong> to embrace new truths.</p>
<p>In Neville’s teachings, our external reality is shaped by our <strong>inner awareness</strong>, and the moment the <strong>He</strong> is added to their names, <strong>Abraham and Sarah’s awareness shifts</strong>. They are no longer confined to a physical world that says they are too old for a child; instead, they are now attuned to a higher <strong>realm of possibility</strong>, where the fulfilment of the promise is not just probable, but certain.</p>
<h3>The Power of Imagination in Manifestation</h3>
<p>From a Neville Goddard perspective, the change in Abraham and Sarah’s names symbolises the <strong>power of imagination to create reality</strong>. <strong>Imagination</strong> is not just a faculty—it is the very <strong>substance of creation</strong>. By receiving the He, they are no longer waiting for a promise to be fulfilled; they are <strong>manifesting it within themselves</strong>. They have fully accepted the promise as their own.</p>
<p>The transformation from <strong>Abram to Abraham</strong> and <strong>Sarai to Sarah</strong> illustrates that when we <strong>embrace the divine breath (imagination)</strong> and align ourselves with our desired state, we <strong>become that state</strong>. The name change marks the <strong>moment when consciousness shifts</strong>, and the <strong>manifestation becomes inevitable</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Takeaway:</h3>
<p>The addition of the letter <strong>He</strong> to Abraham and Sarah’s names is a powerful symbol of <strong>transformation</strong> in Neville Goddard’s framework. It represents the <strong>infusion of divine imagination</strong>, the <strong>expansion of consciousness</strong>, and the <strong>shift into a new identity</strong>. When you align your inner world with the <strong>realisation of your desire</strong>, you, too, create a new reality—just as Abraham and Sarah did.</p>
