<h1>Abraham and Sarah: Change of Name</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s revelation, <strong>imagination</strong> is the faculty that shapes reality. The story of <strong><a href="genesis-126-man.html">Abram</a> and <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Sarai</a></strong> illustrates this principle: it is less about history and more about the transformation of identity within the reader, shown in the symbolic change of their names to <strong>Abraham and Sarah</strong>.</p>

<h2>He: The Window of Imagination</h2>
<p>The Bible presents the <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">'head as house' allegory</a> to teach how consciousness operates. In the <a href="the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Mathers table</a>, the Hebrew letter <strong>He (ה)</strong> represents a <strong>window</strong>. This window is the imagination—the part of the mind that opens to new possibilities. Adding He to their names symbolises the reader’s own imagination being active and receptive, capable of assuming a new state of being and bringing that inner promise into conscious experience.</p>

<h2>Identity Shift: Leaving and Assuming</h2>
<p>When Abram becomes Abraham, and Sarai becomes Sarah, the story marks a <strong>shift in identity</strong> within the reader. The old self is consciously left behind, and the new self is assumed internally. This is not about waiting for external events; it is about the reader embodying the fulfilled state in their own awareness. By holding this assumed identity, the reader aligns their perception with the new state, which naturally unfolds in experience.</p>

<h2>Names as Living Declarations</h2>
<p>Abraham (“father of many”) and Sarah (“princess” or fulfilled promise”) are not merely labels; they are <strong>identity codes</strong> that the reader internalises. Each name contains the quality of the assumed state. As the reader holds and inhabits this identity, the inner structures of consciousness respond, stabilising and enacting the new state within their own mind, which then influences outward experience.</p>

<h2>Genealogies as States of Awareness</h2>
<p>The <a href="scrolls/label-names-and-genealogies-series.html">genealogies</a> map the evolution of consciousness over time. Each name represents a new development of imagination, a fresh assumption of being that the reader can adopt. The transformation of Abraham and Sarah illustrates how an internal shift in identity carries forward, creating a ripple effect in the reader’s awareness, showing continuity of the assumed promise across “generations” of thought.</p>

<h2>Planting the Seed of Fulfilment</h2>
<p>The addition of He to the names can be seen as <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">planting a seed of consciousness in the reader’s own mind</a>. This seed—the assumed identity—is nurtured and grown through imagination, eventually producing the “fruit” of fulfilment. Abraham and Sarah represent the internal planting stage: the reader assumes the desired state, and it unfolds naturally in awareness and perception.</p>

<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>The activation of imagination, symbolised by He in Abraham and Sarah’s names, demonstrates how the reader can consciously shift identity. Leaving the old self and fully inhabiting the new identity enables the promise to be realised within awareness. Genealogies show how this assumed state evolves over time, illustrating that manifestation arises from the reader’s inner assumption of the desired state, rather than from external circumstances.</p>
