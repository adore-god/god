<h1>1 John 3: Perspective through the Law of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The power of assumption—the belief that your desired state is already true—is central to Neville Goddard’s teachings. By assuming the feelings of the wish fulfilled, you align yourself with your desired reality.</p><p>This principle is <a href="genesis-126-man.html">beautifully foreshadowed</a> in <strong>Genesis 1:26</strong>, which declares:</p><blockquote>
<p>“And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness...” (BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>In symbolic language, <a href="elohim-god.html">"God" (Elohim)</a> refers to man's own collective creative powers—his inner judges, rulers, and mental faculties. To be made in this "image and likeness" is to possess the power to imagine, to assume, and to manifest. You are not a passive creation but the operant power, shaping your world from within.</p><p>In this post, we explore 1 John 3 through this understanding: that you are the living image of creative power, and through assumption, you return to your true nature.</p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:1</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“See what great love the Father has given to us, that we are named children of God; and so we are...”</em></blockquote>
To call yourself a <em>child of God</em> is to assume the <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></strong> within you is mental forerunner. This is not about begging for life’s blessings; it’s about recognising your power in self- perception. The world may not recognise you, but your inner identity shift—your assumption—creates reality, not the facts of your surroundings.<p></p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:2</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“...it is not clear what we will be: but we are certain that at His revelation we will be like Him; because we will see Him as He is.”</em></blockquote>
What you shall be depends on what you <strong>assume</strong>. When you see God as imagination (as He is), you become that <a href="genesis-126-man.html">likeness</a>: creative, powerful, and unlimited. <em>The revelation</em> is the moment you realise <strong>imagination is God in action</strong>, and thus, you align yourself with divine creative power.<p></p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:3</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“And everyone who has this hope in Him makes himself holy, even as He is holy.”</em></blockquote>
To live in the assumption of your wish fulfilled is to “purify” yourself—breaking free from the old self and stepping into the new. Holiness is not an external pursuit but an inner state, sustained by the conviction of your assumed identity.<p></p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:4-6</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“Everyone who is a sinner goes against the law... anyone who is in Him does no sin.”</em></blockquote>
To <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">sin is to <strong>miss the mark</strong></a>—to assume unworthy, negative states. When you abide in “Him” (the assumed state of the wish fulfilled), you <strong>cannot sin</strong> because your thoughts, beliefs, and actions align with the highest version of yourself.<p></p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:7-8</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“He who does righteousness is righteous... The Son of God was seen on earth so that he might put an end to the works of the Evil One.”</em></blockquote><a href="judgement-and-righteousness-neville.html">Righteousness</a> is <strong>right assumption</strong>—it is the living out of your ideal state. The “Evil One” represents doubt, fear, and the reactive, outer-oriented mind. The “Son of God” is your <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assumed identity in action</a>, ending the cycle of limiting beliefs by asserting your creative power.<p></p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:9</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“Anyone who is a child of God does no sin, because God’s seed is in him...”</em></blockquote>
Once a <strong>new assumption</strong> is planted (the seed), it rewrites your self-concept. You <strong>cannot continue to sin</strong> (live in unworthy states) when you <em>know</em> who you truly are. The <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a> of awareness transforms you from the inside out.<p></p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:10-12</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“It is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the Evil One...”</em></blockquote>
The difference lies in <strong>what you assume</strong>. Do you dwell in love, abundance, and creativity (God)? Or in fear, limitation, and separation (the Evil One)? Cain represents the old self-perception—he “kills” Abel (the imagination) by <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">assuming the limitations</a> of the physical world. This happens every time we choose doubt over faith.<p></p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:13-15</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“Do not be surprised... if the world has no love for you.”</em></blockquote>
When you <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume the wish fulfilled</a>, you may encounter opposition. The world does not recognise the unseen, and people may not understand your new state of mind. To <a href="the-hatred-of-brothers-imagining.html">hate your brother</a> is to have competing aspects of mind. They “kill” one another by failing to follow the new assumption.<p></p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:16-18</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“Let us not have love in word... but in deed and in good faith.”</em></blockquote>
Love is not just a feeling; it’s a creative act <a href="genesis-224-love.html">cleaving first expressed</a> in Genesis 2:24. Love is <a href="the-bibles-golden-thread-union-with-new.html">continuously expressed as nailing, cleaving, joining, marrying over and over again in the narrative.</a><p></p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:19-21</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“...God is greater than our heart, and has knowledge of all things.”</em></blockquote>
Even when your heart condemns you (through guilt, fear, or old assumptions), <strong>the Law of Assumption transcends all</strong>. The I AM within you is greater than any past mistake. You can revise your assumptions, forgive yourself, and step into a new state of being. When you cease condemning yourself, the flow of assumption becomes free and unimpeded.<p></p>
<h3><strong>1 John 3:22-24</strong></h3>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“And He gives us all our requests, because we keep his laws and do the things which are pleasing in his eyes...”</em></blockquote>
The Law is simple: <strong>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled as a <a href="eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">state of pleasure</a></strong>. Faith in the Son (your imagined self in the fulfilled state) and love (the imaginative grace towards all) are the guiding principles. When you align with these principles, everything you desire must manifest according to your assumption.<p></p><div class="share-dropdown">
