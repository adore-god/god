<h1>New Testament Doxologies</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The New Testament doxologies are often read as simple expressions of praise to a distant God. Yet through the teachings of Neville Goddard, these exalted declarations take on a inner meaning. Rather than pointing outward, they direct us inward — to the true creative power within each of us: <i><a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagination</a></i>. In this article, each doxology is reinterpreted as a celebration of the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>, the awareness that shapes all reality.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Romans 11:36</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
All things originate in imagination (from him), are sustained through continuous assumption (through him), and find their completion in consciousness (to him). Praise is given to the creative power that is your own I AM, the true source of all manifestations.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Romans 16:27</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ! Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
To the only true creative power — imagination — belongs all wisdom and glory. <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">"Jesus Christ" is not a historical person but the awakened imagination in you, through which all glory is expressed</a> eternally.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Galatians 1:5</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
To the divine awareness within — your I AM — belongs eternal glory. Every state you enter and every world you create flow from this inner self.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Ephesians 3:20–21</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
To the I AM within you, which can do more than you can ask or imagine — for it is the imagination itself working in you — belongs all praise. "The church" is the collective body of beliefs, and <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">"Christ Jesus" is your awakened imagination expressing itself across all states and ages.</a></p>
<hr/>
<h2>Philippians 4:20</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
To the awareness of being ("Father") that underlies all creation, belongs all glory. Your own consciousness is the father of all that appears.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>1 Timothy 1:17</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
To your eternal imagination — timeless and unseen, the true creator — belongs all honour and glory. It rules every age because it is beyond time.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>2 Timothy 4:18</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
To the I AM within, the one reality that brings forth all states, be endless praise.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Hebrews 13:21</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>...through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
Through your imagination ("Jesus Christ"), through which all things are made, is all glory forever. Jesus Christ represents your own capacity to assume and feel a state as true.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>1 Peter 4:11</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
To your imagination belong all glory and dominion — for it alone rules and shapes your world.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>1 Peter 5:11</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
Imagination has eternal dominion, as it is the only power that creates and sustains your reality.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>2 Peter 3:18</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
Your creative consciousness deserves glory now and always, for it is the eternal self that projects and sustains all appearances.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Jude 24–25</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
To the one creative power — imagination — which saves and transforms through your awareness of being ("<a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Jesus Christ our Lord</a>"), belongs all majesty and dominion, timelessly and eternally.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Revelation 1:6</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville interpretation:</strong><br>
To imagination, which reigns forever, be all praise and rule — for it alone creates the world you experience.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
