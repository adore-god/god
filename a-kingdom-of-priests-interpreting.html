<h1>Moses Went Up to God: Exodus 19:3-6</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>When the <a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">children of Israel</a> &mdash; symbolising new awareness born from a change in self-identity &mdash; reach Mount Sinai, something unfolds. This is not a historical covenant but a psychological one for the elevation into imaginative awareness, as Neville Goddard taught.</p><p>Through Exodus 19:3&ndash;6, we see the movement from bondage to breakthrough within consciousness &mdash; the shift from outer dependence to inner realisation of &ldquo;<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>.&rdquo;</p><hr/><h3>Exodus 19:3 &mdash; &ldquo;Moses went up to God&rdquo;</h3><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And Moses went up to God, and the Lord said to him from the mountain, Say to the children of Jacob and to the children of Israel:&rdquo;<br/>
Exodus 19:3</p>
</blockquote><p>In symbolism, Moses represents your developed ability to hear the inner voice &mdash; to commune with the &ldquo;<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>&rdquo; (Exodus 3:14). The mountain is the high place of consciousness; the eagle symbolises the vision and flight of imagination.</p><p>When Moses ascends the mountain, it reflects your own act of turning away from the senses and lifting your attention to a higher state &mdash; where you hear true inner guidance.</p><hr/><h3>Exodus 19:4 &mdash; &ldquo;I took you on eagles&rsquo; wings and brought you to myself&rdquo;</h3><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I took you on eagles&rsquo; wings and made you come to myself.&rdquo;<br/>
Exodus 19:4</p>
</blockquote><p>This verse is spoken in the past tense &mdash; affirming that deliverance has already taken place. Egypt symbolises mental bondage and limitation. The eagle&rsquo;s wings represent effortless spiritual elevation, showing how imagination lifts you when you surrender to your true nature.</p><p>The phrase <em>&ldquo;brought you to myself&rdquo;</em> is vital: it reveals that the destination is not a location but a state &mdash; your own being, the &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo; This echoes Jesus&rsquo; words: <em>&ldquo;<a href="in-my-fathers-house-john-142-3.html">In my Father&rsquo;s house are many resting-places</a>&rdquo;</em> (John 14:2). All true deliverance is a return to self-realisation.</p><hr/><h3>Exodus 19:5 &mdash; &ldquo;If you will truly give ear to my voice... you will be my special treasure&rdquo;</h3><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you will truly give ear to my voice and keep my agreement, then you will be my special property out of all the peoples: for all the earth is mine.&rdquo;<br/>
Exodus 19:5</p>
</blockquote><p>Here we see the condition: obey the inner voice. In Neville&rsquo;s teaching, this means remaining loyal to your assumption &mdash; to your inner vision &mdash; rather than to outer facts.</p><p>To be a &ldquo;special property&rdquo; or &ldquo;peculiar treasure&rdquo; means to be precious and set apart. The soul that obeys the I AM lives as through self-authorship rather than to reaction and limitation.</p><hr/><h3>Exodus 19:6 &mdash; &ldquo;You will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&rdquo;</h3><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And you will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which you are to say to the children of Israel.&rdquo;<br/>
Exodus 19:6</p>
</blockquote><p>A kingdom of priests symbolises individuals who know how to minister from within &mdash; who offer the true sacrifice of self, letting go of the old identity to embody a chosen new state.</p><p>A &ldquo;holy nation&rdquo; is not a physical territory but a collective of inner states aligned with the creative power of the I AM (Exodus 3:14). It is a nation born not of geography but of awareness.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
