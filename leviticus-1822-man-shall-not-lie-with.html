    <h1>Leviticus 18:22: “A Man Shall Not Lie With a Man as With a Woman”</h1>
    <p>The Bible is filled with stories that symbolise inner states of <a href="elohim-god.html">awareness</a> and mental processes. When we see these narratives as psychological symbolism, we uncover deeper insights into imagination, desire, ego, and transformation — making the teachings deeply relevant to our personal growth.</p><h3>The Literal Verse and Its Inner Meaning</h3><blockquote>
<p>“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”<br/>
— Genesis 2:24</p>
</blockquote><p>Traditionally, Genesis 2:24 is read as the foundation of physical marriage. Yet spiritually, it reveals a inner concept: the necessity for the conscious self (the "<a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>") to leave old conditioning (symbolised by "father and mother") and unite with its own inner creative faculty (the "<a href="genesis-224-love.html">wife</a>") — imagination.  <a href="genesis-224-love.html">Read more on this here</a>.</p><p>This union forms a new "one flesh," the perfect fusion of conscious desire and subconscious receptivity, leading to true creation and manifestation.</p><h3>Leviticus 18:22: A Symbol of Inner Misalignment</h3><blockquote>
<p>“You shall not lie with a man as with a woman; it is an abomination.”<br/>
— Leviticus 18:22</p>
</blockquote><p>Rather than purely a physical prohibition, this verse highlights a spiritual warning: when the ego <a href="genesis-126-man.html">(man)</a> attempts to unite only with itself <a href="genesis-126-man.html">(man)</a>, it bypasses imagination <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">(woman)</a>, resulting in a sterile, self-consuming state.</p><p>This is the opposite of the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">union urged</a> in Genesis 2:24, where true creative power is realised through harmonising the masculine conscious self and feminine subconscious imagination.</p><h3>Amnon and Tamar: A Tragic Misunion</h3><p>In 2 Samuel 13, Amnon represents the outwardly driven ego, and Tamar symbolises the inner feminine imagination. <a href="tamah-judah-and-perez.html">Tamar has already been presented as an example of imagination in the story of Judah and Tamar</a>. Instead of honouring and uniting with her in love, Amnon violates her — reflecting the ego's attempt to dominate rather than to merge in a sacred, creative way.</p><p>Amnon refuses to "leave father and mother" (old patterns and selfish desires), and instead of becoming "one flesh" in harmony, he forces a union, resulting in inner chaos and spiritual barrenness.</p><h3>Cakes: Stolen Nourishment</h3><p>When Tamar prepares cakes (2 Samuel 13:6), they symbolise the fruits of imagination — the spiritual nourishment that arises from true inner union. Amnon's coercive demand for these cakes represents the ego’s attempt to feed on creative power without proper engagement, illustrating what Genesis 2:24 warns against: the failure to form true inner marriage.</p><h3>Song of Solomon: The True Fulfilment</h3><p>In contrast, the <a href="label-song-of-solomon-series.html">Song of Solomon</a> embodies the proper union:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Strengthen me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.”<br/>
— Song of Solomon 2:5</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the <a href="label-bride---bridegroom-series.html">bride and bridegroom</a> represent the joyful union of masculine and feminine within. They willingly unite, resulting in sweetness and creative fruitfulness — the true "one flesh" of Genesis 2:24.</p><p>This union is mutual, nurturing, and fully receptive. It is the ideal inner marriage that Genesis 2:24 symbolises: the conscious self lovingly embracing imagination, resulting in manifestation and spiritual renewal.</p><h3>Neville Goddard’s Insight: Harmonious Assumption</h3><p>Neville taught that manifestation demands a loving engagement with the imagination — assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled. This act embodies Genesis 2:24: the ego leaving behind external conditioning and uniting with the inner creative power to form "one flesh" — the new state of consciousness that births our reality.</p><p>Amnon's story serves as a warning against trying to force outcomes without this sacred union. The Song of Solomon celebrates the joyful merging that unlocks spiritual and creative abundance.</p><hr/><p><strong>Summary Table</strong></p><table>

</table><hr/><h3><strong>Final Thought</strong></h3><p>Genesis 2:24, when seen psychologically, reveals the secret of true creation: leaving behind external authority ("father and mother") and entering the joyful, receptive union with imagination ("wife"), to become "one flesh."</p><p>Leviticus 18:22 warns of the sterile loop of ego with ego, as tragically embodied by Amnon and Tamar. The Song of Solomon, by contrast, celebrates the sacred marriage within — the true and joyful sharing of "cakes," the fruits of a loving, imaginative union.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-spiritual-violations-series.html">Spiritual Violations Series</a></p>
