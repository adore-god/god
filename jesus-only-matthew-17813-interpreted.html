<h1>"Jesus Only": Matthew 17:8–13 Interpreted Through the Law of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Matthew 17:8–13 is not a mystical episode about heavenly beings glowing on a mountaintop. When read through the Law of Assumption, as taught by Neville Goddard, it reveals a clear and powerful shift in consciousness: the moment when all outside forms of authority fall away, and only your assumption—your accepted state of being—remains.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>“They saw no man, save Jesus only.”</strong></h2>
<p>This is the key phrase in the passage. It’s not a minor detail—it’s the message.</p>
<p>Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus during the Transfiguration. But when the disciples lift their eyes after falling in fear, those two figures are gone. Only Jesus remains.</p>
<p>In the Law of Assumption, this means you’ve stopped looking to external frameworks (Moses, the law) or future expectations (Elijah, the prophet) as your source of direction or authority. Instead, you recognise <strong>your own I AM—the awareness of being—as the sole creative power</strong>. You stop seeking validation outside yourself. You no longer ask, “What does the law say?” or “What will happen if?” You assume the state, and that assumption becomes the law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Stop looking on the outside for help. Everything is within you.”</em> – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To “see Jesus only” is to see only your inner state. You stop referencing the world. You stop negotiating with conditions. You stop waiting. You <em>assume</em> the state of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Tell the Vision to No One</strong></h2>
<p>As they descend the mountain—symbolising the return to everyday awareness—Jesus tells them not to speak of the vision “until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.”</p>
<p>Neville explained this language as symbolic. “Son of Man” refers to the idea or state you’ve assumed. Its “rising” is not physical resurrection, but the moment when that assumption becomes alive in you—when it feels natural and begins to reflect in your world.</p>
<p>Until that inner resurrection has occurred, it is best to remain silent. This is not superstition; it’s spiritual discipline. If you speak too soon—before the state is fixed in your mind—you risk subjecting it to questioning, doubt, or contradiction. That weakens it.</p>
<p>You protect the assumption in silence, allowing it to take root. Once it lives in you, it will express itself outwardly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and remain faithful to your assumption.”</em> – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Elias Has Already Come</strong></h2>
<p>The disciples ask why the scribes say Elijah must come first. Jesus replies that Elijah <em>has</em> come already, but people didn’t recognise him. The disciples then understand he was referring to John the Baptist.</p>
<p>In the symbolic reading, Elijah (or John) is the preparatory state—the moment before a new assumption takes hold. It is the time of inner questioning, the first stirring when the old self begins to break down, but the new one hasn’t fully emerged.</p>
<p>This early stage is often ignored or dismissed. People wait for dramatic change, missing the quiet signal that the inner path has already opened. Elijah “has come”—you were already invited to shift states—but you didn’t recognise it because your attention was still on the outer world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Change your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live.”</em> – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The transition begins before you know it. Often, by the time you notice it, it has already happened.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Summary of the Inner Movement</strong></h2>
<p>This passage maps the psychological movement from seeking help outside yourself to assuming full creative power through identity. The steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Mountain</strong> – A temporary rise in consciousness where you glimpse your potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Transfiguration</strong> – Realisation that the creative power is not external, but internal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moses and Elijah vanish</strong> – Old reliance on laws and future expectations disappears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Jesus only” remains</strong> – You acknowledge imagination, your I AM, as the only operative power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Silence</strong> – You protect the new state by not exposing it prematurely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elijah already came</strong> – You realise the process of inner change was already underway before you recognised it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Final Thought</strong></h2>
<p>Matthew 17:8–13 is not about an historical event. It’s about <em>you</em>. It shows the moment of spiritual clarity when your reliance on outer conditions ends, and you take full responsibility for your life by assuming a new state of being.</p>
<p>You don’t wait for law, for prophecy, or for permission. You assume the state now—and hold to it. That is “Jesus only.” Not a man, but a principle: <strong>your own I AM—consciousness—as God.</strong></p>
<p>Once you see that clearly, the rest of your transformation is just a matter of persistence.</p>
