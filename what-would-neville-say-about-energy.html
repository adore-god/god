<h1>What Would Neville Say About Energy Vampires?</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“No one to change but self.”</em> — Neville Goddard</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I AM THAT I AM.” — Exodus 3:14</em></p>
<p><em>“I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me.”</em> — Isaiah 45:5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In modern spiritual language, few terms are as vivid—or as commonly used—as <strong>“energy vampire.”</strong> It evokes the image of someone who drains your life force, leaves you feeling depleted, and disrupts your emotional balance. But through Neville Goddard's revelation of the Bible, the idea takes on a very different—and far more empowering—meaning.</p>
<p>Neville didn’t teach us to fear others. He taught us to <em>observe ourselves.</em> Not because other people don’t influence us, but because no influence can truly affect us unless <em>we accept it as real</em>.</p>
<p>What we call an “energy vampire” is not stealing energy; we are simply <em>forgetting who we are</em>.</p>
<p>This is why the Bible says, <em>“I AM THAT I AM”</em>—not <em>I was</em>, not <em>I will be</em>, but <em>I AM</em>. This sacred name reveals the truth that God is your own awareness of being. And just as salt preserves and strengthens what it touches, the teachings of truth preserve your identity—the <em>I AM</em>—in the midst of a forgetful and reactive world.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>It's Not Their Energy—It's Your Identity</strong></h2>
<p>To Neville, every encounter is a mirror. Every individual you meet plays a role you have unconsciously assigned them through your assumptions and self-concept. So when someone appears to “drain” you, Neville would not ask what they’ve done to you—he would ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“What have you assumed about yourself in their presence?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These people don’t have some mystical power to take your peace. Rather, you momentarily step into <em>their</em> state of being—fear, anxiety, lack—and abandon your own. You accept their emotional atmosphere as your own, and in doing so, you <em>vacate your chosen identity</em>.</p>
<p>This is the real drain—not of energy, but of self-awareness.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>The Drift from I AM</strong></h2>
<p>Neville insisted that your <strong>I AM</strong> is the only creative power. “Be still and know that I AM God,” he quoted often. But in moments of weakness or distraction, we let go of that centre. We drift.</p>
<p>You start the day in the state of peace, gratitude, or confidence. But an interaction with someone who is agitated or needy can begin to pull you into a different assumption. You sympathise with their state. You internalise their perspective. Slowly, your emotional footing shifts—and you don’t feel like “yourself” anymore.</p>
<p>That’s the moment of forgetting.</p>
<p>You haven’t been attacked. You’ve been invited. And you accepted.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Beware the Rhetoric That Drains</strong></h2>
<p>This drift doesn’t just happen in conversation—it also happens in teaching.</p>
<p>Neville warned against reading the Bible as secular history. To him, the Bible is a psychological drama, unfolding within the mind of every individual. But when it is preached as external fact, as a story about people long ago and far away, it has the same effect as an energy vampire: it <strong>pulls you out of your own I AM</strong>.</p>
<p>You begin to seek God in the sky, in the past, in the approval of religious leaders—instead of within. You lose the sense that you are the operant power. And once again, you forget your own identity.</p>
<p>Even spiritual teachings can become energy-draining when they place the power outside of you.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Salt: The Preserver of Identity</strong></h2>
<p>In the Bible, salt is not just a seasoning—it is a <strong>symbol of preservation</strong>. Jesus called his followers <em>“the salt of the earth”</em>—those who preserve the truth of being, the truth of the I AM. Salt prevents decay, much like a conscious assumption prevents drift.</p>
<p>To “have salt in yourself” means to keep the knowledge of your true identity—your divine creative awareness—intact, unspoiled, unshaken by the external world.</p>
<p>Holding fast to your chosen state, even in the face of agitation, is how you “salt” your I AM. It is how you become the preserving power in your own life.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Return to Your State</strong></h2>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>You remember. You <em>reclaim your I AM.</em></p>
<p>Neville would never suggest cutting off others as the first solution. Instead, he would call you to mastery—<em>to remain rooted in your chosen state no matter what the outer world presents</em>. The person in front of you is not a threat—they are simply showing you where you stand in consciousness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You rise or fall in life by the assumptions you make.”</em> — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you assume yourself to be at the mercy of others’ moods, you’ll live as their emotional subject. But if you remain faithful to the state you’ve chosen—peace, clarity, joy—the world must rearrange itself to reflect that.</p>
<p>And those who once seemed draining? They’ll either rise with you or vanish from your experience.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Final Thought: Stay Awake</strong></h2>
<p>The true meaning of an “energy vampire,” in Neville’s world, is a state that tempts you to forget your own. The real work is not in labelling others—but in <em>staying awake</em>.</p>
<p>People don’t steal your energy. You simply stop guarding your I AM.</p>
<p>You drift into a state not your own—and then wonder why you feel scattered, tired, or defeated.</p>
<p>The solution? <strong>Come back. Assume your chosen state. Salt your I AM. And live from it.</strong></p>
<p>There is no one to change but self.</p>
