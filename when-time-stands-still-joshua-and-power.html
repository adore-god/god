<h1>When Time Stands Still: Joshua and the Power of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In the book of Joshua, there is a moment so striking, so extraordinary, that Scripture pauses to tell us it had never happened before—and has not happened since. A man speaks, and the cosmos listens. The sun stands still. The moon stops. The day is prolonged until victory is secured.</p>
<p>But when viewed through the deeper symbolic framework taught by <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, this event is not a fantastical moment in ancient history. Rather, it reveals a profound <strong>truth about imagination, consciousness, and assumption</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Passage – Joshua 10:12–14 (ESV)</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Sun, stand still at Gibeon, and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.”</em><br>
<em>And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies… There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD heeded the voice of a man, for the LORD fought for Israel.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Joshua: The Directed Will in Us All</strong></h2>
<p>In traditional reading, Joshua is a leader, a military man, a conqueror. But when approached from a symbolic, psychological point of view—especially in the light of Neville’s teachings—<strong>Joshua is a state of consciousness</strong>.</p>
<p>He represents the <strong>directed will</strong>: the part of us that has claimed the promise, assumed the end, and acts from the conviction that what is imagined is real. Joshua does not plead for divine intervention—he commands, in full trust that the power of creation is one with his assumption.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Stopping the Sun and Moon: Mastery Over Time</strong></h2>
<p>The sun and moon in this story symbolise more than just light sources. They represent <strong>the passage of time</strong>, the seeming laws of nature and delay. By commanding them to stop, Joshua is demonstrating spiritual dominion over the illusion of time-bound causality.</p>
<p>In Neville’s language, this is the act of <strong>"living in the end"</strong>—suspending the natural cycles of doubt, waiting, and decay in order to dwell in the state where the desired outcome is already true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The sun standing still is the inner decision to dwell in the fulfilment of the desire, for as long as it takes, until the battle with doubt is over.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are moments in life when you must freeze the world—not outwardly, but inwardly—by remaining unmoved in your assumption. This is what Joshua does. He arrests the movement of external reality until his inner state is fully realised.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>“The LORD Heeded the Voice of a Man”</strong></h2>
<p>This statement is thunderous. God obeyed a man? According to traditional theology, such a thought may seem blasphemous. But to those who understand Neville’s teachings, it is a stunning revelation.</p>
<p>The <strong>“voice of a man”</strong> here is not literal speech—it is the <strong>inner word</strong>, the assumption, the decision to stand firm in what one has imagined. And <strong>the LORD</strong>—not a distant deity, but the <em>I AM</em>, the <strong>creative imagination within</strong>—responds. It must.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You are the operant power,”</em> Neville often said. <em>“God is your own wonderful human imagination.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you speak with faith, from conviction, imagining the end with such vividness that you dwell in its feeling, then the outer world—like the sun and the moon—must obey.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Book of Jashar: A Record of Spiritual Uprightness</strong></h2>
<p>The passage mentions the Book of Jashar, which means “The Book of the Upright.” Symbolically, this represents the inner record—the memory and momentum of standing in alignment with the truth of one’s being. Every moment of spiritual victory is recorded, not in some external scroll, but in your own evolving state of consciousness.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Battle of Assumption</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, when it says <em>“the LORD fought for Israel,”</em> this is not a literal war account. Israel, in Neville’s interpretation, is the <strong>awakening of spiritual consciousness</strong>—the name given to the collective journey of those seeking to realise their identity as imagination itself.</p>
<p>And when the true self stands in assumption, all of divine power fights alongside it—not by violence, but by the <strong>rearrangement of outer conditions to support inner conviction</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: Time Will Wait for the Assumed End</strong></h2>
<p>There are times when you feel the clock ticking. When delay seems certain. When evidence contradicts the desire. And in those moments, Joshua teaches you something extraordinary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stop the sun. Command the moon. Dwell in your assumption. Time will wait.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage, rightly seen, is not a miracle of astronomy—it is a miracle of faith, imagination, and the unwavering decision to persist until the desire is fulfilled.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
