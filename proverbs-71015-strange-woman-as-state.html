    <h1>Proverbs 7:10–15 — The Strange Woman as a State of Consciousness</h1>
    <p>Proverbs 7:10–15 describes a scene where a woman, often called the "strange woman" or "adulteress," approaches a young man with seductive and persuasive speech. Here's the passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.”</em><br/>
— <em>Proverbs 7:10–15 (KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Neville Goddard’s symbolic and psychological interpretation of the Bible, this passage isn't about literal sexual immorality. Instead, it's a parable about <strong>the seductive pull of the external world</strong>—or more precisely, <strong>the temptation to direct imagination toward appearances and sense-data rather than the inner vision of faith</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s how a Neville-inspired interpretation might be laid out in an article:</p>
<hr/>
<h3><em>Proverbs 7:10–15 — The Strange Woman as a State of Consciousness</em></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, every character in scripture is a state of consciousness. The “strange woman” (or prostitute or harlot in some translations) in Proverbs 7 is not a person, but a symbolic representation of <strong>the enticing suggestion to believe in appearances over imagination</strong>.</p>
<p>She wears the attire of a harlot—meaning she <strong>disguises herself as appealing, promising satisfaction or truth</strong>, but she has no anchor in the inner house (the stable, inner awareness of "I AM"). She’s loud and stubborn, constantly roaming the streets—symbolising <strong>the scattered attention and noisy world of appearances</strong> that pull the individual away from inner stillness.</p>
<p>When she says, <em>“I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows,”</em> she mimics the language of religious or spiritual fulfilment, offering the illusion of righteousness. This represents <strong>false satisfaction—momentary pleasures or promises that come from following the senses</strong>, rather than the sustained joy that comes from inner conviction and alignment with the true self.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>“I came forth to meet thee... I have found thee”</em> represents how <strong>outer circumstances often appear to “seek us out”</strong> when our attention is scattered. These are the manifestations that match our unfocused or reactionary states—rather than the disciplined inner knowing Neville urges his students to cultivate.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><em>The Deeper Message</em></h3>
<p>Neville would likely say that Proverbs 7 is a cautionary tale against spiritual adultery—not infidelity between people, but the <strong>betrayal of your imagination</strong>. When you “sleep” with the strange woman, you <strong>give your creative power to fear, doubt, and external facts</strong> instead of keeping it anchored in the inner vision of your desire fulfilled.</p>
<p>This passage calls the reader to watchfulness: <strong>to recognise when you are tempted to be seduced by appearances</strong>, and to remain faithful to your inner world—your imagination, your I AM.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-proverbs-series.html">Proverbs Series</a> | <a href="label-women-in-the-bible-series.html">Women in the Bible Series</a></p>
