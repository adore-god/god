<h1>Praise: Raised and Sustained Assumption </h1><div class="container">

<p></p><div><img alt="Praise Throne Sceptre Icon The Way" border="0" data-original-height="1803" data-original-width="1574" height="320" src="images/1748590291668.jpg" width="278"/></div><div><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>“If you do well, will you not be lifted up?” — Genesis 4:7</strong></blockquote><p></p>
<p>The early chapters of Genesis are not about two brothers in a field. They’re about you — and what you offer to yourself each moment in imagination. One state of mind is Abel: quiet, assumptive, faithful. The other is <b><a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Cain: angry, cynical, brooding</a></b> — convinced that life has wronged him, that others are chosen, that he is overlooked. But the truth is Cain doesn’t understand the law.</p>
<p>What law? That your <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">inner assumptions</a> create your world.</p>
<p>In Genesis 4:6–7, <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Cain is depressed</a>, his face fallen. Why? Because his offering is not accepted. But <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> says something astonishing: <em>“If you do well, will you not be lifted up?”</em> In other words: if you assume rightly — if you bring the right offering — your inner state will be exalted. It is not the world punishing Cain. It is Cain refusing to rise.</p>
<p>Anger, sulking, jealousy — these are the signs of an unoffered self. They are the emotional residue of someone still worshipping the facts of life rather than their divine power to change them.</p>
<p>This isn’t about giving God a better gift. It’s about treating your own <a href="elohim-god.html">imagination as God</a>.</p>
<p>To praise isn’t to flatter some external deity. Praise means <em>to raise</em> — to elevate your assumption of self. It means stopping the mental habit of defeat, bitterness, and passive resentment and choosing instead to <b><a href="genesis-224-love.html">cleave to the vision of who you truly desire to be</a></b>.</p>
<p>As Genesis 2:24 says:</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>“For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife…”</strong></blockquote><p></p>
<p>The 'father and mother' are the psychological patterns you were raised with — the stories, limits, and emotional grooves you inherited. To praise is to leave those familiar, inherited assumptions and cleave instead to your desired identity — your ‘wife’. That <a href="genesis-224-love.html">act of cleaving</a> is a form of praise. You lift your <a href="label-word-of-god-series.html" class="noTag">inner conversation</a>, you turn from complaint, you offer up your mind to its highest assumption.</p>
<p>Neville wrote: “<b><a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</a></b>.” But many Cain-states would rather assume rejection, pity, and injustice — not realising this is the only thing being “offered.” Not a lamb. Not grain. Just the state. And the state determines the outcome.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>“And if you do not do well, sin is waiting at the door, desiring you…” — Genesis 4:7</strong></blockquote><p></p>
<p>Sin here is not moral failure. It’s <a href="label-hitting-or-missing-the-mark--aim--series.html" class="noTag">missing the mark</a> of assumption. You haven’t imagined well — you’ve imagined poorly of yourself. You have offered up a low state. And that state rules over you until you lift your eyes and choose again.</p>
<p>Praise, then, is not a performance. It is an inner act of devotion to your higher self — the one you <em>choose</em> to be. When you refuse to dwell in the Cain-state, you are praising. When you walk away from the passive inner accusations and step into the bold feeling of “I AM,” you are praising.</p>
<p>The Messiah came through <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Judah</a> — the name meaning <em>praise</em>. Why? Because the power to transform begins not in the evidence, but in the assumption that dares to believe in its own divinity.</p></div><p class="label-links"><a href="label-genesis-2-24-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 2:24 Series</a> | <a href="label-genesis-4-7-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 4:7 Series</a> | <a href="label-judah-series.html" class="noTag">Judah Series</a> | <a href="label-praise-series.html" class="noTag">Praise Series</a> | <a href="label-the-four--fathers-of-the-law.html" class="noTag">The Four: Fathers of the Law</a></p>
