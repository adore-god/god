<h1>Praise: Raised and Sustained Assumption </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<div><img alt="Praise Throne Sceptre Icon The Way" src="images/wp/praise-raise-king.webp"/></div><div><blockquote>&ldquo;If you do well, will you not be lifted up?&rdquo; &mdash; Genesis 4:7</blockquote>
<p>The early chapters of Genesis are not about two brothers in a field. They&rsquo;re about you &mdash; and what you offer to yourself each moment in imagination. One state of mind is Abel: quiet, assumptive, faithful. The other is <b><a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Cain: angry, cynical, brooding</a></b> &mdash; convinced that life has wronged him, that others are chosen, that he is overlooked. But the truth is Cain doesn&rsquo;t understand the law.</p>
<p>What law? That your <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">inner assumptions</a> create your world.</p>
<p>In Genesis 4:6&ndash;7, <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Cain is depressed</a>, his face fallen. Why? Because his offering is not accepted. But <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> says something astonishing: <em>&ldquo;If you do well, will you not be lifted up?&rdquo;</em> In other words: if you assume rightly &mdash; if you bring the right offering &mdash; your inner state will be exalted. It is not the world punishing Cain. It is Cain refusing to rise.</p>
<p>Anger, sulking, jealousy &mdash; these are the signs of an unoffered self. They are the emotional residue of someone still worshipping the facts of life rather than their divine power to change them.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about giving God a better gift. It&rsquo;s about treating your own <a href="elohim-god.html">imagination as God</a>.</p>
<p>To praise isn&rsquo;t to flatter some external deity. Praise means <em>to raise</em> &mdash; to elevate your assumption of self. It means stopping the mental habit of defeat, bitterness, and passive resentment and choosing instead to <b><a href="genesis-224-love.html">cleave to the vision of who you truly desire to be</a></b>.</p>
<p>
<blockquote class="center"> 
Blessed be the name of the LORD <br/> 
from this time forth and forevermore! <br/> 
From the rising of the sun to its setting,<br/> 
the name of the LORD is to be praised! &mdash; Psalm 113:2-3
</blockquote> 
The <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">name</a> of the <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a> to <em>be praised</em>  is your <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM!</a>
<p>As Genesis 2:24 says:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>&ldquo;For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife&hellip;&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>The 'father and mother' are the psychological patterns you were raised with &mdash; the stories, limits, and emotional grooves you inherited. To praise is to leave those familiar, inherited assumptions and cleave instead to your desired identity &mdash; your &lsquo;wife&rsquo;. That <a href="genesis-224-love.html">act of cleaving</a> is a form of praise. You lift your <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-word-of-god-series.html">inner conversation</a>, you turn from complaint, you offer up your mind to its highest assumption.</p>
<p>Neville wrote: &ldquo;<b><a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</a></b>.&rdquo; But many Cain-states would rather assume rejection, pity, and injustice &mdash; not realising this is the only thing being &ldquo;offered.&rdquo; Not a lamb. Not grain. Just the state. And the state determines the outcome.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>&ldquo;And if you do not do well, sin is waiting at the door, desiring you&hellip;&rdquo; &mdash; Genesis 4:7</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Sin here is not moral failure. It&rsquo;s <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-hitting-or-missing-the-mark--aim--series.html">missing the mark</a> of assumption. You haven&rsquo;t imagined well &mdash; you&rsquo;ve imagined poorly of yourself. You have offered up a low state. And that state rules over you until you lift your eyes and choose again.</p>
<p>Praise, then, is not a performance. It is an inner act of devotion to your higher self &mdash; the one you <em>choose</em> to be. When you refuse to dwell in the Cain-state, you are praising. When you walk away from the passive inner accusations and step into the bold feeling of &ldquo;I AM,&rdquo; you are praising.</p>
<p>The Messiah came through <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Judah</a> &mdash; the name meaning <em>praise</em>. Why? Because the power to transform begins not in the evidence, but in the assumption that dares to believe in its own divinity.</p>
<p>
<blockquote class="center"> 
"Praise the LORD! <br/> 
I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart, <br/> 
in the company of the upright, in the congregation." <br/> &mdash; Psalm 111:1

<small class="blockquote-cap"> The 'congregation' and 'company' are allegory for the <a href="elohim-god.html">manifold aspects of the mind.</a> The 'whole heart' is <a href="genesis-224-love.html">defined in <span class="noTag">Genesis 2:24</span></a></small>
