<h1>The Law: TIMELINE</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>


<p><strong>Important note before reading:</strong><br>
This timeline is <em>not</em> meant to imply that consciousness unfolds in a rigid, linear order. It is written this way only to help the mind form a rough picture of the biblical narrative. In lived experience, the movement is <strong>circular and instantaneous</strong>. One can be Job in the morning and Jesus by evening; trapped in suffering one moment and living from assumption the next. The Bible describes recurring <em>states</em> of mind, not historical steps you must slowly climb.</p>

<p>Seen this way, the Bible is a psychological pattern detailing the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>. From Genesis to Revelation, it illustrates how awareness moves from outer effort and confusion into inner certainty and creative authority. Each character represents a stage, posture, or movement of consciousness. This timeline simply arranges those movements so the process is easier to recognise and apply.</p>

<h2><strong>The Law of Assumption: A Psychological Timeline</strong></h2>

<hr>

<h3><strong><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-job-series.html">Job — The Search Stage</a></strong></h3>
<p>Consciousness seeks God through suffering and self-questioning.<br>
Life feels unjust, external, and punitive.<br>
The realisation slowly dawns: God was never outside. <em>(Job 1–42)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="elohim-god.html">Elohim — Awareness Multiplied</a></strong></h3>
<p>“God” is plural: imagination expressed as many inner faculties.<br>
All experience arises from within awareness. <em>(Gen 1)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="genesis-1-creation.html">Creation — Assumption in Motion</a></strong></h3>
<p>“Let there be” reveals imagination forming reality.<br>
Thought precedes form. <em>(Gen 1)</em></p>

<h3><strong>Adam &amp; Eve — The First Sense of Self Portrayed as Adam and Eve</strong></h3>
<p>The reader places the first <a href="genesis-126-man.html">"man"</a> in the garden called Adam, which is the reader's first awareness of of self, followed by <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Eve</a> who is drawn from it. <br>
The fall symbolises forgetting  assumption and falling into judgement. <em>(Gen 2–3)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Cain &amp; Abel — Misuse or Alignment</a></strong></h3>
<p>Sin = imagining from resentment rather than love.<br>
Abel represents aligned assumption; Cain, effort and displeasure.<br>
We all begin as <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Cain</a>, yet longing for something more. <em>(Gen 4)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="cain-lamech-and-jesus-psychology-of.html">Lamech — Mental Loops</a></strong></h3>
<p>Repetition of pain, revenge, and self-wounding states.<br>
The mind reinforcing its own suffering. <em>(Gen 4:23–24)</em></p>

<h3><strong>Noah — Mental Reset</strong></h3>
<p>The cleansing of long-held assumptions.<br>
Imagination preserved for renewal. <em>(Gen 6–9)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="divided-by-doctrine-confusion-of.html">Tower of Babel — Inner Confusion</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Law is sensed but misunderstood.<br>
Inner language struggles to turn inward after relying on outer effort. <em>(Gen 11)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham — Faith Begins</a></strong></h3>
<p>Leaving the old identity behind.<br>
Living toward the unseen end. <em>(Gen 12–25)</em></p>

<h3><strong>Isaac — Joy Appears</strong></h3>
<p>Laughter as the first fruit of assumption.<br>
<a href="sarahs-laughter-humour-of-manifestation.html">Sarah laughs</a> before joy is embodied. <em>(Gen 17–21)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Jacob — Persistence</a></strong></h3>
<p>Refusing to let go of a desired state.<br>
<a href="jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html">Wrestling with identity</a> until it is assumed. <em>(Gen 25–32)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="twelve-tribes-summary-law-of-assumption.html">Israel &amp; the Twelve — Inner States</a></strong></h3>
<p>The emergence of multiple psychological faculties. <em>(Gen 35)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Judah — Praise</a></strong></h3>
<p>Raising assumption through inner affirmation.<br>
First conscious play with the Law. <em>(Gen 29, 38)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph — Imagination Governs</a></strong></h3>
<p>Dreaming future states and sustaining them internally.<br>
Imagination feeds all other states. <em>(Gen 37–50)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="benjamin.html">Benjamin — Tender Awareness</a></strong></h3>
<p>The young state beginning to respond to <a href="genesis-224-love.html">inner love</a> rather than outer law.<br>
A fledgling sensitivity awakening within consciousness.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="leviticus-law-adam-and-eve-and-nakedness.html">Leviticus &amp; Numbers — Externalisation</a></strong></h3>
<p>The Law is sensed but projected outward.<br>
Ritual replaces embodiment. Desire is observed, not lived.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="moses-and-burning-bush.html">Moses — Awareness Declared</a></strong></h3>
<p>“I AM THAT I AM.”<br>
Awareness recognises itself as God. <em>(Ex 3:14)</em></p>

<h3><strong>Joshua — Claiming States</strong></h3>
<p>Entering new assumptions by faith.<br>
Conquering limiting beliefs. <em>(Joshua)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-david-series.html">David — Love Assumed</a></strong></h3>
<p>The beloved state emerging.<br>
Old control (Saul) resists inner change.<br>
David represents alignment with the ideal. <em>(1 Sam)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-solomon-series.html">Solomon — Fulfillment</a></strong></h3>
<p>The mind matures through the careful ordering of identity.<br>
“I AM” is no longer tested, but deliberately shaped and established.<br>
Peace follows because the assumption is now stable and embodied. <em>(1 Kings 1–11)</em></p>



<h3><strong>Exile &amp; Return — Drift and Recall</strong></h3>
<p>Temporary identification with negative states.<br>
Return to awareness. <em>(Kings, Ezra, Nehemiah)</em></p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>New Testament — Living From Assumption</strong></h2>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Virgin Birth — New State Conceived</strong></h3>
<p><a href="the-virgin-birth-of-love.html">The ability to sustain an assumption without evidence</a>. <em>(Mt 1, Lk 1)</em></p>

<h3><strong>John the Baptist — Revision</strong></h3>
<p><a href="repentance-from-guilt-to-imagination.html">Repent</a> = revise the assumption.<br>
John represents the active, corrective movement of mind—questioning, adjusting, and turning awareness away from former conclusions. This state appears alongside Jesus, alternating in consciousness as preparation occurs. <em>(Mt 3)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="the-parallel-between-noahs-flood-and.html">Baptism &amp; Wilderness</a></strong></h3>
<p>Full immersion into the revised state.<br>
Jesus represents the assumed identity itself, while John fades as revision gives way to embodiment.<br>
<a href="in-wilderness-hidden-symbolism-of.html">The wilderness</a> marks the oscillation between correction and conviction until the assumption stabilises. <em>(Mt 3–4)</em></p>


<h3><strong><a href="jesus-his-disciples-psychological-drama.html">Twelve Disciples</a></strong></h3>
<p><a href="the-calling-of-twelve-gospel-story.html">Inner faculties organised</a> to sustain identity. <em>(Mt 10)</em></p>

<h3><strong>Wedding at Cana — Inner Union</strong></h3>
<p><a href="el/lazarus-wedding-cross-symbolism.html">Thought and feeling marry</a>.<br>
Assumption externalises joy. <em>(Jn 2)</em></p>

<h3><strong>Miracles — Healing the Mind</strong></h3>
<p>The healings symbolise inner correction, not spectacle.<br>
The blind see when perception changes, the lame walk when self-concept is released, and the deaf hear when inner resistance softens.<br>
“Your faith has made you whole” points to assumption restoring <a href="to-choir-master-what-it-really-means-in.html">psychological harmony</a>.<br>
Imagination reorders the mind, and the outer follows.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus — Awareness Personified</a></strong></h3>
<p>“I AM” as the sole creative power. <em>(Jn)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="raising-of-lazarus.html">Lazarus — Dormant Self Raised</a></strong></h3>
<p><a href="jesus-wept-for-easter-sunday.html">Neglected inner identity</a> revived by assumption. <em>(Jn 11)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html">Crucifixion — Assumption Fixed</a></strong></h3>
<p>The old identity dies.<br>
The decision is final. <em>(Jn 19)</em></p>

<h3><strong>Resurrection — Living From Being</strong></h3>
<p>The assumption now feels natural.<br>
Effort ceases.</p>

<h3><strong>Ascension — Detachment</strong></h3>
<p>Freedom from old emotional gravity. <em>(Acts 1)</em></p>

<h3><strong>Pentecost — Inner Language Renewed</strong></h3>
<p><a href="interpreting-power-of-tongues-in-bible.html">New automatic thoughts</a> aligned with identity. <em>(Acts 2)</em></p>

<h3><strong><a href="the-damascus-turning-from-sauls-old.html">Saul on the Road to Damascus</a></strong></h3>
<p>Relentless self-judgement and inner hostility exhaust the mind.<br>
Blindness marks the collapse of this distorted seeing.<br>
When the scales fall, perception clears—the persecutor is recognised as the self.<br>
Awareness realigns with “I AM.” <em>(Acts 9)</em></p>


<h3><strong>Acts &amp; Letters — Integration</strong></h3>
<p>Life reorganises around being.<br>
<a href="pauls-mysteries-and-revelation-of.html">“Christ in you”</a> as lived identity.</p>

<h3><strong><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-revelation-series.html">Revelation — Completion</a></strong></h3>
<p>Consciousness fully ordered by assumption.<br>
<a href="genesis-1-creation.html">Creation</a> experienced as finished. <em>(Rev 21–22)</em></p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>The Bible describes how identity shifts.</p>
<p><strong>Old Testament:</strong> Awakening to imagination.<br>
<strong>New Testament:</strong> Living from it.</p>
<p>This movement happens whenever awareness changes state — not once in history, but continually.</p>
