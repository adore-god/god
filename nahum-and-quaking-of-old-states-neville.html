<h1>Nahum and the Quaking of Old States: A Neville Goddard Reading</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The name <em>Nahum</em> (from the Hebrew <strong>נַחוּם</strong>, <em>Nachum</em>) means <strong>comfort</strong> or <strong>consolation</strong>. At first glance, this seems ironic. The Book of Nahum is an intense prophetic writingin the Bible, filled with images of wrath, destruction, and upheaval. Yet within it is a profound psychological truth that aligns deeply with Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption: <strong>the comfort comes through the collapse of the old</strong>.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Earthquakes of Inner Transformation</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“He says sharp words to the sea and makes it dry, drying up all the rivers: Bashan is feeble, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon is without strength. The mountains are shaking because of him, and the hills become like wax; and the earth is burning before him, and the world and all who are living in it.”</em><br>
— Nahum 1:4–5, BBE</p>
</blockquote><p>In the Law of Assumption, <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> is not a distant deity but <strong>your own wonderful human imagination</strong>—the “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” within. When you assume a new state of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>—say, the state of being loved, wealthy, free—everything unlike it begins to break down.</p><p>The “shaking” of mountains and the “burning” of the earth represent the <strong>destabilisation of old mental structures</strong>. These are once-dominant assumptions—your deep-seated beliefs, fears, and identities. <em>Bashan</em> and <em><a href="carmel-garden-of-king-symbol-of-soul.html">Carmel</a></em>, known in Scripture for their fertility and flourishing, symbolise former states that once seemed fruitful. Yet in the light of a new assumption, they must “waste away”—not because they are evil, but because they no longer serve your chosen end.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Goodness of Destruction</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“The Lord is good, a strong place in the day of trouble; and he has knowledge of those who take him for their safe cover.”</em><br>
— Nahum 1:7, BBE</p>
</blockquote><p>To the traditional reader, this might seem like a contradiction. How can a God who dries up rivers and causes mountains to quake be “good”? But through Neville’s interpretation, the answer becomes clear: <strong>this inner power is good precisely because it responds to your assumption</strong>.</p><p>When your world begins to fall apart after adopting a new inner state, it isn’t punishment—it’s <strong>purification</strong>. The subconscious mind is reordering itself to match your new assumption. It’s uncomfortable, often chaotic, but entirely necessary.</p><p>God “has knowledge of those who take Him for their safe cover.” That is, your deeper consciousness responds only to your <strong>faith in the unseen</strong>—not to your words, but to your inner dwelling place. If you remain loyal to the assumption of your wish fulfilled, you are “known” by this power, and it will not fail you.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Fall of Nineveh: The Collapse of the Old Identity</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“See, I am against you, says the Lord of armies; I will <a href="the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">take off your clothing</a>, uncovering you to the nations, and let the kingdoms see your shame.”</em><br>
— Nahum 3:5, BBE</p>
<p><em>“Your pain may not be made well: your wound is cruel: all who get the news of you will give a clap of joy over you: for where has anyone not been damaged by your evil ways again and again?”</em><br>
— Nahum 3:19, BBE</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Nineveh</strong>, in this context, represents the <strong>former ruling state of mind</strong>—a dominant identity built on fear, limitation, or self-wounding. The Hebrew spelling <strong>נִינְוֵה (Nīnəwēh)</strong> may be linked to the concept of “offspring” or “dwelling,” reinforcing its symbolic identity as the <em>outgrowth of a former assumption</em>. When the “Lord of armies” (your awakened awareness) declares “I am against you,” it simply means that this new consciousness cannot coexist with the old one. Your assumption of a new identity is incompatible with the continued existence of the old beliefs.</p><p>Thus, Nineveh must fall. Not as an act of vengeance, but as a requirement for manifestation.</p><hr><h3><strong>Nahum: The Comfort That Comes After the Storm</strong></h3><p>Seen symbolically, the name <em>Nahum</em> makes perfect sense. The <strong>comfort</strong> is not in the avoidance of destruction, but in the knowledge that destruction is <strong>creative</strong>. Every structure that collapses within you is making way for a new one. Every assumption you persist in is forming the pattern of your future.</p><p>As Neville said, <em>“You must be willing to let go of all you now are in order to become what you want to be.”</em> Nahum gives us this process in poetic and prophetic form.</p><hr><h3><strong>Final Thoughts: A Prophetic Pattern of Transformation</strong></h3><p>The Book of Nahum is not a disjointed outburst of divine anger—it is a precise and consistent prophetic pattern of <strong>internal transformation</strong>. Through the symbolic reading offered by Neville Goddard’s teachings, it reveals the inevitable collapse of every state that no longer aligns with your assumed identity. The old city—Nineveh—must fall, not because it is evil in itself, but because it cannot coexist with the creative act of imagining something higher. Bashan, Carmel, and the mountains shake not in judgment, but in response to the <strong>reordering of consciousness</strong>. And through it all, we are reminded: <strong>“The Lord is good”</strong>—because the power within you is always faithful to the state you dare to occupy. This short but potent book reminds us that <strong>destruction is not the opposite of comfort—it is often the doorway to it</strong>.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
