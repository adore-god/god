<h1>The Power Outlet of Imagination: Why Reason Can’t Elevate Consciousness</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>I saw a TikTok recently that made me laugh — but also made me think. A guy held up an extension cord that was plugged into itself and said, “You can't use reason and logic to elevate your consciousness.” It was so simple and absurd it became profound.</p><p>Because he was right.</p><p>Trying to elevate your consciousness with the same mind that’s confined to logic and past experience is like plugging an extension cord into itself. No matter how hard you try, you’ll never get power. It just loops. It just runs in circles.</p><p>Neville Goddard would’ve loved this analogy.</p><p>He taught that <strong>reason is the enemy of imagination</strong> when it comes to true transformation. Reason is grounded in what is seen, measured, and historically proven. It obeys the senses. But imagination? Imagination transcends the senses. It <em>creates</em> what reason could never justify.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The drama of life is a psychological one,” Neville wrote. “You bring things into being by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled — not by trying to reason your way there.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This is echoed in <strong>Hebrews 11:1</strong>: <em>“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”</em> Faith isn’t grounded in reason — it’s grounded in the unseen, the imagined, the felt-but-not-yet-visible.</p><p>And in <strong>Proverbs 3:5</strong>, we’re warned: <em>“Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.”</em> Neville would interpret this as an urging to trust the deeper reality of your imagination — your “Lord” — rather than leaning on surface-level logic.</p><p>When someone says, “Be realistic,” what they really mean is “Stay plugged into the loop.” Stay in the same feedback system that’s created your current life. But if you want to break the loop, you’ve got to dare to imagine what doesn’t yet exist — and then live as though it <em>does</em>.</p><p>Plug into that, and the current starts to flow.</p><p>Neville’s challenge to all of us is this: <strong>Don’t wait for life to show you evidence before you believe. Believe, and life will follow.</strong> That’s not logic. That’s power.</p>
