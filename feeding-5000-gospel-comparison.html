<p>All <a href="why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">four Gospels</a> record the story of <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> feeding a multitude with just five loaves and two fish. On the surface, it’s a miracle of provision. But in the language of Neville Goddard, it is a pattern for imaginative abundance, the principle that the world responds not to what we lack, but to what we assume.</p><p>This is not a story about physical bread. It is about the bread of <b><a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness—the feeding of the multitude within</a>.</b></p><hr><h3>The Setting: The Wilderness of Thought</h3><p><em>(Matthew 14:13, Mark 6:31–32, Luke 9:10, John 6:3)</em></p><p>Each <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Gospel</a> places the event in a remote place—a wilderness, far from towns or markets. This isn’t geographical; it’s psychological. The wilderness represents the seeming <a href="in-wilderness-hidden-symbolism-of.html">emptiness when we turn away from the world of facts and appearances</a>. It’s the inner space where nothing “material” seems to support our desire.</p><blockquote>
<p>“And Jesus went away from there in a boat to a lonely place by himself.”<br>
<em>(Matthew 14:13)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To feed the five thousand here is to bring fulfilment to a barren state—not by importing external resources, but by drawing from the inner substance of belief. Imagination, not logic, sustains.</p><hr><h3>The Problem: “We Have Only…”</h3><p><em>(Matthew 14:17, Mark 6:38, Luke 9:13, John 6:9)</em></p><p>In each account, the <a href="twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html"><b>disciples see lack</b></a>. They say, “We have only five loaves and two fish.” To the rational mind, this is insufficiency. But to Jesus—the awakened “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html"><b>I AM</b></a>”—this is more than enough, once assumed rightly.</p><p>Neville Goddard taught that every state already contains within it the means of its expression. The five loaves and two fish are symbolic elements:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Five loaves:</strong> our five senses, the tools through which we perceive limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two fish:</strong> feeling and imagination, the hidden creative forces swimming beneath the surface of conscious awareness.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“They said to him, We have only five loaves and two fish.”<br>
<em>(Matthew 14:17)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>What you perceive (the loaves) and what you imagine (the fish) are the building blocks of your world. Though they seem meagre, when offered to the<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html"><b> I AM</b></a> in gratitude and faith, they multiply.</p><hr><h3>The Miracle: Looking Up and Giving Thanks</h3><p><em>(Matthew 14:19, Mark 6:41, Luke 9:16, John 6:11)</em></p><p>Only John’s Gospel mentions that the loaves and fish come from <a href="scrolls/label-mystery-boy-series.html" class="noTag">a boy—a small, seemingly insignificant contributor</a>. This boy symbolises the childlike potential within, the <a href="scrolls/label-child-like-faith.html" class="noTag">part of you that still believes</a>.</p><blockquote>
<p>“There is a boy here, who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many?”<br>
<em>(John 6:9)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Jesus looks up, blesses the food, breaks it, and gives it to the disciples to distribute. This sequence mirrors Neville’s method:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Look up:</strong> Lift your vision from appearance to assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bless:</strong> Identify what you have as already complete—“It is good.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Break:</strong> Emotionally experience the reality in imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Give:</strong> Send the feeling out—persist in the assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“He took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.”<br>
<em>(Luke 9:16)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The miracle doesn’t occur in the sky or by divine intrusion. It happens in consciousness. The moment you stop saying, “I only have…” and start saying, “I AM…”, the loaves multiply.</p><hr><h3>Twelve Baskets Left Over</h3><p><em>(Matthew 14:20, Mark 6:43, Luke 9:17, John 6:13)</em></p><p>Each Gospel reports that twelve baskets were collected afterward. <a href="scrolls/label-numbers--twelve.html" class="noTag">Twelve</a> is not arbitrary—it points to the twelve faculties of the mind, the same <a href="twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">twelve apostles</a>. These faculties, when fed with imagination, become containers of abundance.</p><blockquote>
<p>“And the people ate, and were filled; and they took up twelve baskets of broken pieces left over.”<br>
<em>(Matthew 14:20)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>You do not lose by assuming abundance; you expand. The leftovers mean your consciousness now holds more than it did before. The faculties—once limited—are now stretched, filled, trained.</p><hr><h3>The Feeding of the Four Thousand: Compassion and Inclusion</h3><p><em>(Matthew 15:32–39, Mark 8:1–10)</em></p><p>Later, a second feeding occurs with seven loaves and a few fish, feeding 4,000 people. While similar on the surface, this event points to a deeper nourishment—one that includes aspects of the mind previously overlooked. This is not a repetition but a reinforcement: spiritual nourishment is ongoing.</p><p><a href="genesis-1-creation.html">Seven loaves represent completion and wholeness</a> (reflecting the seven days of creation). The number 4,000 symbolises the manifestation of spiritual truths into the created world (the <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">four gospels</a>, the four directions, four corners of the earth).</p><blockquote>
<p>“How many loaves have you?” And they said, “Seven.”<br>
<em>(Mark 8:5)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This meal nourishes not just the <a href="twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">twelve conscious faculties</a>, but the broader subconscious aspects that make up <strong>Elohim</strong>—the plural name for God, representing the manifold aspects of mind that collectively shape reality.</p><blockquote>
<p>“And they did all eat, and were filled; and they took up seven baskets full of broken pieces left.”<br>
<em>(Matthew 15:37)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>If the first feeding awakens the twelve faculties, this second feeding extends nourishment to the entire spiritual structure of self. Every aspect of your inner being must be fed from within the awareness of “I AM.” Ignoring parts of yourself prevents full manifestation.</p><hr><h3>Joseph Opens the Storehouses</h3><p><em>(Genesis 41:56–57)</em></p><blockquote>
<p>“And the famine was over all the land; and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold corn to the Egyptians; and the famine was sore throughout the land of Egypt. And all lands came to Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn, because the famine was sore in all lands.”<br>
<em>(Genesis 41:56–57)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph</a> symbolises imaginative mastery during famine—times of apparent lack. He opens the storehouses of grain, providing sustenance not just for Egypt but for many lands. This is a <i><b>metaphor for accessing the inner storehouses of imagination and consciousness</b></i>, the unseen riches available even when outer conditions seem barren.</p><p>Like Joseph, you must break open your granaries of mind to nourish yourself and others. True provision is always available within.</p><hr><h3>The Last Supper: The Final Feed</h3><p><em>(Matthew 26:26, Mark 14:22, Luke 22:19, John 13–17)</em></p><p>At the <a href="the-last-supper-neville-goddards.html">Last Supper</a>, Jesus again takes bread, blesses it, breaks it, and gives it, saying:</p><blockquote>
<p>“He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, ‘Take, eat; this is my body.’”<br>
<em>(Mark 14:22)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville Goddard would emphasise that this is not literal flesh, but consciousness itself. Your <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assumption is the body of belief</a>. To break bread is to break limitation; to give it is to share your spiritual state with the world.</p><p>This final meal is a profound inward shift:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>body</strong> (your fixed assumption) is established.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>wine</strong> (your life essence, or feeling) is poured out in imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>disciples</strong> (your faculties) receive their final nourishment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><a href="joseph-and-jesus-patterns-of-fulfilment.html">Jesus’ entire ministry</a> symbolically recounts this process: from famine and stored grain, through miracles of feeding, to the breaking of bread—the internal transformation from limitation to abundance.</p><hr><h3>Conclusion: Feeding the Elohim Within</h3><p>The name <strong>Elohim</strong> is plural, revealing that God is not a single faculty but the <a href="elohim-god.html"><b>totality of mind—each aspect needing nourishment and guidance</b></a>. The feeding miracles show that every part of you must be fed by the assumption of “I AM.”</p><p>Whether it’s five loaves or seven, 5,000 or 4,000, the principle remains the same:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Nothing is lacking except belief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What you bless, multiplies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What you imagine, feeds the world within.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the mystery of abundance. You are not waiting for God.<br>
<strong>You are the one breaking the bread.</strong></p><div class="share-dropdown">
