<h1>Peter: I Do Not Know the Man</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Across the Gospel narratives, <a href="genesis-126-man.html">John, Jesus, and Peter represent movements within consciousness itself</a>. The stories describe how awareness shifts between observing, assuming, resisting, and finally stabilising in a new state. When read this way, the Bible becomes a precise psychological account of the <strong>law of assumption</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jesus and John: Observer and Assumed Self</h2>

<p>In John’s Gospel especially, there is a <a href="el/john-and-jesus-symbolism.html">subtle fluidity between Jesus and John</a>. At times John appears as the observer — the awareness that witnesses what is unfolding. Jesus appears as the self moving through embodiment — the state being assumed.</p>

<p>This is not accidental. Neville Goddard repeatedly taught that scripture moves between <em>the one who is aware</em> and <em>the one who is experienced</em>. Awareness can observe a state, then step into it and <a href="esau-and-jacob-isaacs-blessing.html">wear it as “me</a>.” John represents the witnessing consciousness; Jesus represents the assumed identity moving toward fixation — what Neville called the crucifixion, the fixing of an assumption.</p>

<p>Seen this way, the arrest of <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> is not an external betrayal but an inward moment: the new assumption is no longer theoretical. It is being taken seriously. It is about to be fixed.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Simon Peter: Hearing, Reasoning, and the Rock of the Skull</h2>

<p>Simon Peter’s name carries two key ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Simon</strong> comes from <a href="he-who-has-ears-to-hear-hearing-as.html">“hearing” — the receptive, reasoning mind that listens, reacts, and weighs evidence</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Peter</strong> means “rock” — not moral strength, but structure. The fixed framework through which we interpret reality.</li>
</ul>

<p>This “rock” is not an external church. Symbolically, it is the skull — the mental structure where assumptions are held and from which perception flows.</p>

<p>Peter therefore represents the conditioned mind: the part of us that can recognise truth intellectually, confess it verbally, and yet recoil when that truth demands the death of an old self-concept.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Recognition Without Endurance</h2>

<p>When Peter declares, “You are the Christ,” he is not lying. This is genuine recognition. In Neville’s terms, it is the moment you embody your <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">anointed, ideal, set apart you — the chosen one developed throughout the narrative</a>.</p>

<p>But immediately after, Peter resists the crucifixion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Be it far from you, Lord.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the same inner conflict everyone experiences with the law of assumption. We like recognition, but we resist implication. To <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume a new state</a> means the old identity must die. The reasoning mind — Simon — objects.</p>

<p>Jesus’ response, “Get behind me, Satan,” is not a moral rebuke. “Satan” simply means adversary. It is the <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">adversarial thought that argues from appearances and refuses the inner movement of assumption</a>. It is told to get <em>behind</em>, not destroyed — reasoning must follow, not lead.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Walking on Water: Assumption Versus Appearance</h2>

<p><a href="walking-on-waters-of-consciousness.html">Peter walking on water</a> shows the same mechanism. He steps out when focused on the word — the assumption. He sinks when attention returns to the wind — sensory evidence.</p>

<p>The lesson is not about courage, but consistency. Assumption works only while it is occupied inwardly. The moment awareness re-identifies with appearances, the state collapses.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Denial: When the Old Structure Cannot Follow</h2>

<p>During the arrest, this tension reaches its peak. Jesus moves inward, toward fixation of a new state. Peter remains outside.</p>

<p>When questioned, Peter says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I do not know the man.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not cowardice alone. Psychologically, it is the inability of the old self-concept to recognise the new assumed identity. The reasoning mind cannot yet say, “This is me.” The denial is structural, not moral.</p>

<p>The cock crowing symbolises awakening — the sudden realisation that belief has lagged behind assumption. It is the moment you see the split within yourself.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Unnamed Disciple: Silent Alignment</h2>

<p>Alongside Peter stands another figure: an unnamed disciple who enters freely with Jesus.</p>

<p>In scripture, names signify fixed states. To be unnamed is to be unconditioned. This disciple represents quiet inner knowing — awareness that does not argue, explain, or resist. It simply moves with the assumption.</p>

<p>While Peter stands outside analysing and denying, this aspect is already inside. This is the part of you that knows a shift is real before there is any external confirmation.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Restoration: Stability After Collapse</h2>

<p>Peter’s later restoration is not forgiveness for failure; it is integration. The threefold denial is balanced by a threefold affirmation of love — love here meaning attachment, allegiance, fixation.</p>

<p>Once the old structure has collapsed, it can be rebuilt properly — now serving the assumed state rather than opposing it. The rock becomes stable only after it has failed.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion: The Law of Assumption in Living Form</h2>

<p>This entire drama describes the law of assumption in motion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recognition arises.</li>
  <li>Resistance appears.</li>
  <li>Collapse exposes the split.</li>
  <li>Assumption stabilises.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesus is the assumed self moving inward. John is the observing awareness. Peter is the conditioned structure learning, through failure, to follow rather than lead.</p>

<p>The Bible is not asking you to admire these figures. It is showing you how consciousness actually changes — not cleanly, not instantly, but inevitably, once assumption is fixed.</p>
