<h1>Paul: The Word Is Near You</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>What if righteousness wasn’t something earned by outward behaviour, but something <em>claimed inwardly</em> through assumption? In <b>Romans 10:5 – 11:7</b>, Paul reveals a truth that—read symbolically—aligns powerfully with Neville Goddard’s core message: <strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">salvation is psychological</a></strong>. Your <em>own wonderful human imagination</em> is the Christ, and by <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assuming your desire is fulfilled,</a> you live in grace, not effort.</p>
<p>Let’s explore these verses through Neville’s lens, where characters symbolise states of mind, and salvation is the awakening of consciousness.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Righteousness by Law vs. Righteousness by Faith </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, ‘The man who does those things shall live by them.’ But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way, ‘Do not say in your heart, “Who will ascend into heaven?”... or “Who will descend into the abyss?”’” — Romans 10:5–7</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul begins by highlighting two opposing systems: <em>outer action</em> and <em>inner conviction</em>. The law is based on works—external conformity. But the “<a href="judgement-and-righteousness-neville.html">righteousness of faith</a>” doesn’t seek validation in far-off places. You don’t have to climb to heaven or descend into the abyss to bring about change. As Neville would put it: <strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ is your imagination</a></strong>, already present within. You do not have to look anywhere but <em>inward</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Word Is in Your Mouth and Heart </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart… If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart… you will be saved.” — Romans 10:8–10</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To confess “Jesus is Lord” is not about religious allegiance—it’s about assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled. <em>Your assumption is your confession.</em> And to “believe in your heart” means to <em>accept as true now</em> what reason may deny. The resurrection becomes psychological: <strong><a href="genesis-224-love.html">your desire rises in you</a> when you accept it as real</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>No Shame in Assumption </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame… For 'whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'” — Romans 10:11–13</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Neville, the “<a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">name of the Lord</a>” is <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></strong>—your core being. To “call on the name” is to assume a new identity: <em>I AM wealthy</em>, <em>I AM loved</em>, <em>I AM healed</em>. Whoever lives from this state will not be disappointed, because the outer world reflects the inner claim.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>How Will They Hear Unless It Is Preached? </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“How shall they believe… without a preacher?… Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” — Romans 10:14–17</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville taught that we must <em>first hear the truth within</em>. That “preacher” is not always a person—it is the <strong>inner awakening</strong> to the law of assumption. Hearing isn’t just auditory—it’s <strong>emotional acceptance</strong>. Every time you dwell in the feeling of your wish fulfilled, you're “<a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-word-of-god-series.html">hearing the word</a>” and <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">planting the seed</a> of faith.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>A Disobedient and Contrary Mind </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and contrary people.” — Romans 10:18–21</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God here is your higher self—your <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>—constantly available. Yet we resist it, turning to external causes instead of inner knowing. The “disobedient people” are those aspects of our own consciousness still loyal to facts and appearances, refusing to enter the imaginative act.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Has God Cast Off His People?</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Has God cast away His people? Certainly not… God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew.” — Romans 11:1–2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville would remind us: <strong>your divine potential is never rejected</strong>. Even when you feel separated from the creative power within, the imagination (Christ) remains with you. Paul’s identity as an Israelite symbolises this: even the old, reason-based mindset can awaken and become the elect.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Remnant Within You </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I alone am left… But what does the divine response say to him? ‘I have reserved for Myself seven thousand…’” — Romans 11:3–5)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elijah’s cry of despair is a voice we all know: <em>“Why isn’t this working? Why am I alone in this belief?”</em> But God’s reply—<em>“I have a remnant”</em>—speaks to the inner states in you that still hold the <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a> of truth. The “seven thousand” symbolise <strong>the undisturbed, faithful assumptions</strong> deep within. Even when the surface self is in turmoil, <strong>your deeper self still remembers</strong> the law.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Grace, Not Works </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If by grace, then it is no longer of works… otherwise grace is no longer grace.” — Romans 11:6</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pure Neville: <strong>you are not saved by effort</strong>. You're not required to prove yourself, change your behaviour, or earn divine favour. <strong>You simply <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume the truth of what you desire</a>, and grace brings it forth.</strong> Imagination is grace in action—the effortless power to become what you accept.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Elect and the Blind </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were blinded.” — Romans 11:7</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your whole being seeks fulfilment. But only the “elect”—the parts of you that are awake to assumption—receive it. The rest (your doubting, reactive self) remains blind, trapped in sense data and logic. The elect are not a chosen few—they are the <strong>inner faculties trained to live by imagination</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Final Word: The Word Is Always Near You</strong></h2>
<p>In Romans 10–11, Paul reveals that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Christ is not external—<strong>it is your imagination.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not need to strive—you need to <strong>assume</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The creative power is not far off—it is <strong>in your mouth and your heart</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even in doubt, a remnant of belief remains in you, ready to bring about change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grace is simply <em>imagining lovingly</em>, and living from that state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are always free to turn within. You don’t need to climb up to find power, nor dig deep to be worthy. <strong>The word is near you. It is in you. It is you.</strong></p><div class="share-dropdown">
