<h1>Paul: The Word Is Near You</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>What if righteousness wasn&rsquo;t something earned by outward behaviour, but something <em>claimed inwardly</em> through assumption? In <b>Romans 10:5 &ndash; 11:7</b>, Paul reveals a truth that&mdash;read symbolically&mdash;aligns powerfully with Neville Goddard&rsquo;s core message: <strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">salvation is psychological</a></strong>. Your <em>own wonderful human imagination</em> is the Christ, and by <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assuming your desire is fulfilled,</a> you live in grace, not effort.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore these verses through Neville&rsquo;s lens, where characters symbolise states of mind, and salvation is the awakening of consciousness.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Righteousness by Law vs. Righteousness by Faith&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, &lsquo;The man who does those things shall live by them.&rsquo; But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way, &lsquo;Do not say in your heart, &ldquo;Who will ascend into heaven?&rdquo;... or &ldquo;Who will descend into the abyss?&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; &mdash; Romans 10:5&ndash;7</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul begins by highlighting two opposing systems: <em>outer action</em> and <em>inner conviction</em>. The law is based on works&mdash;external conformity. But the &ldquo;<a href="judgement-and-righteousness-neville.html">righteousness of faith</a>&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t seek validation in far-off places. You don&rsquo;t have to climb to heaven or descend into the abyss to bring about change. As Neville would put it: <strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ is your imagination</a></strong>, already present within. You do not have to look anywhere but <em>inward</em>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Word Is in Your Mouth and Heart&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart&hellip; If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart&hellip; you will be saved.&rdquo; &mdash; Romans 10:8&ndash;10</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To confess &ldquo;Jesus is Lord&rdquo; is not about religious allegiance&mdash;it&rsquo;s about assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled. <em>Your assumption is your confession.</em> And to &ldquo;believe in your heart&rdquo; means to <em>accept as true now</em> what reason may deny. The resurrection becomes psychological: <strong><a href="genesis-224-love.html">your desire rises in you</a> when you accept it as real</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>No Shame in Assumption&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame&hellip; For 'whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'&rdquo; &mdash; Romans 10:11&ndash;13</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Neville, the &ldquo;<a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">name of the Lord</a>&rdquo; is <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></strong>&mdash;your core being. To &ldquo;call on the name&rdquo; is to assume a new identity: <em>I AM wealthy</em>, <em>I AM loved</em>, <em>I AM healed</em>. Whoever lives from this state will not be disappointed, because the outer world reflects the inner claim.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>How Will They Hear Unless It Is Preached?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How shall they believe&hellip; without a preacher?&hellip; Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&rdquo; &mdash; Romans 10:14&ndash;17</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville taught that we must <em>first hear the truth within</em>. That &ldquo;preacher&rdquo; is not always a person&mdash;it is the <strong>inner awakening</strong> to the law of assumption. Hearing isn&rsquo;t just auditory&mdash;it&rsquo;s <strong>emotional acceptance</strong>. Every time you dwell in the feeling of your wish fulfilled, you're &ldquo;<a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-word-of-god-series.html">hearing the word</a>&rdquo; and <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">planting the seed</a> of faith.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>A Disobedient and Contrary Mind&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and contrary people.&rdquo; &mdash; Romans 10:18&ndash;21</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God here is your higher self&mdash;your <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>&mdash;constantly available. Yet we resist it, turning to external causes instead of inner knowing. The &ldquo;disobedient people&rdquo; are those aspects of our own consciousness still loyal to facts and appearances, refusing to enter the imaginative act.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Has God Cast Off His People?</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Has God cast away His people? Certainly not&hellip; God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew.&rdquo; &mdash; Romans 11:1&ndash;2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville would remind us: <strong>your divine potential is never rejected</strong>. Even when you feel separated from the creative power within, the imagination (Christ) remains with you. Paul&rsquo;s identity as an Israelite symbolises this: even the old, reason-based mindset can awaken and become the elect.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Remnant Within You&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I alone am left&hellip; But what does the divine response say to him? &lsquo;I have reserved for Myself seven thousand&hellip;&rsquo;&rdquo; &mdash; Romans 11:3&ndash;5)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elijah&rsquo;s cry of despair is a voice we all know: <em>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t this working? Why am I alone in this belief?&rdquo;</em> But God&rsquo;s reply&mdash;<em>&ldquo;I have a remnant&rdquo;</em>&mdash;speaks to the inner states in you that still hold the <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a> of truth. The &ldquo;seven thousand&rdquo; symbolise <strong>the undisturbed, faithful assumptions</strong> deep within. Even when the surface self is in turmoil, <strong>your deeper self still remembers</strong> the law.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Grace, Not Works&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;If by grace, then it is no longer of works&hellip; otherwise grace is no longer grace.&rdquo; &mdash; Romans 11:6</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pure Neville: <strong>you are not saved by effort</strong>. You're not required to prove yourself, change your behaviour, or earn divine favour. <strong>You simply <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume the truth of what you desire</a>, and grace brings it forth.</strong> Imagination is grace in action&mdash;the effortless power to become what you accept.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Elect and the Blind&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were blinded.&rdquo; &mdash; Romans 11:7</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your whole being seeks fulfilment. But only the &ldquo;elect&rdquo;&mdash;the parts of you that are awake to assumption&mdash;receive it. The rest (your doubting, reactive self) remains blind, trapped in sense data and logic. The elect are not a chosen few&mdash;they are the <strong>inner faculties trained to live by imagination</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Final Word: The Word Is Always Near You</strong></h2>
<p>In Romans 10&ndash;11, Paul reveals that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Christ is not external&mdash;<strong>it is your imagination.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not need to strive&mdash;you need to <strong>assume</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The creative power is not far off&mdash;it is <strong>in your mouth and your heart</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even in doubt, a remnant of belief remains in you, ready to bring about change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grace is simply <em>imagining lovingly</em>, and living from that state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are always free to turn within. You don&rsquo;t need to climb up to find power, nor dig deep to be worthy. <strong>The word is near you. It is in you. It is you.</strong></p><div class="share-dropdown">
