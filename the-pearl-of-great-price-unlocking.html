<h1>The Pearl of Great Price</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<div style="text-align: left;"><blockquote>"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.<br>When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought" — Matthew 13:45-46</blockquote></div><p>In the Gospel of Matthew 13:45-46 there’s a parable that speaks of a merchant searching for fine pearls. When he finds the pearl of great price, he sells everything he owns to possess it. This pearl represents something of immense value, something worth sacrificing everything for.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard, in his teachings, offers a deeper understanding of this parable that aligns perfectly with his <a href="genesis-foundational-principles.html"><b>principles of manifestation, imagination</b></a>, and the creative <a href="elohim-god.html">power within us</a>. For Neville, the pearl of great price symbolises the true self – the unshakable awareness of being that exists beyond the fluctuations of the outer world. It is the essence of your <a href="elohim-god.html">imagination</a>, which has the power to create and shape your reality.</p>
<h3>The Pearl as Your Imagination</h3>
<p>Neville often emphasised that <b><a href="elohim-god.html">imagination</a> is the key to unlocking any desired experience</b>. The pearl of great price is not a physical object, but a symbolic representation of the power within you to manifest anything you wish. Just as the merchant sold everything to obtain the pearl, Neville teaches that we must be <a href="genesis-224-love.html">willing to let go</a> of old beliefs, outdated concepts, and limitations to fully embrace the creative power of imagination. This means stepping away from the influence of the outer world, and instead turning inward, to the <a href="the-seven-churches-of-revelation.html">kingdom</a> of your imagination, where all things are possible.</p>
<p>In a world dominated by external circumstances and the opinions of others, it is easy to forget the treasure that lies within. But when you realise that your <b><a href="genesis-1-creation.html">imagination is the source of all creation</a>,</b> you understand that nothing is more valuable than this inner power. It’s the pearl that can bring about profound change in your life, manifesting your desires and transforming your reality.</p>
<h3>The Sacrifice: Letting Go of the Old Self</h3>
<p>The merchant in the parable gave up all he had to obtain the pearl. This mirrors Neville’s concept of the “<a href="genesis-126-man.html">old man</a>” – the part of you that is limited by external circumstances, fears, doubts, and societal programming. To acquire the pearl of great price, you must be willing to sacrifice the old identity that no longer serves you. You must let go of beliefs that keep you tethered to a past version of yourself and embrace the truth of who you really are: a creative being with the power to manifest your desires through your imagination.</p>
<p>This is not a simple task, and it requires dedication. The process involves surrendering the mind’s tendency to focus on what is currently “real” in the external world. Instead, you must persist in imagining and feeling the reality you desire, even when it doesn’t yet appear. This act of faith and persistence is what ultimately leads to the manifestation of your desires, just as the merchant’s sacrifice led to him obtaining the pearl.</p>
<h3>The Power of Imagination: Your Personal Treasure</h3>
<p>Neville teaches that your imagination is not just a tool but the very essence of who you are. It is the pearl of great price, and it is through your <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">imagination that you can create a new world for yourself</a> - the one visually demonstrated in <a href="el/revelation-overview.html">Revelation</a>.

<blockquote> 
"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass." — Revelation 21:21 <small>(The 'pearly gates') </small> 
</blockquote> 

When you understand the immense power of your imagination, you begin to see that anything is possible. The external world, with all its challenges and limitations, is no match for the inner power of your creative consciousness.</p>
<p>The key is to use your imagination deliberately, to see and feel the end result of your desires, and to live from that place in your mind. This is how you “buy” the pearl of great price: by consciously creating and embracing the life you wish to experience. As Neville often said, “Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled,” and by doing so, you bring the manifestation into being.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: The Pearl of Great Price Within You</h3>
<p>The pearl of great price is not a distant, unattainable treasure. It is within you, waiting to be discovered. By embracing your imagination and using it as a tool to shape your reality, you possess the most valuable treasure in existence. The parable reminds us that the ultimate price of true transformation is letting go of the old self – the self that is limited by the outer world – and embracing the truth of our own creative power.</p>
<p>In the end, the pearl of great price is your awareness of the power within you, the power to imagine and create. This is the treasure that is worth everything. And it is yours to claim, if you are willing to make the sacrifice, to let go of the old, and to embrace the new.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-parable-series.html" class="noTag">Parable Series</a></p>
