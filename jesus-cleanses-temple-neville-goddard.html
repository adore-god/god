<h1>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, <strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> cleansing the temple</strong> (Matt. 21:12–17; Mark 11:15–19; Luke 19:45–48; John 2:13–22) is an allegory for the <strong>purification of the mind</strong>. The temple is not just a physical structure; it represents <strong>your <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a></strong>, the sacred space where your thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions shape your reality. To truly manifest desires, it is essential to cleanse the mind of distractions, false beliefs, and limiting assumptions. Let’s explore this biblical moment through Neville's lens.</p><hr/><h3><strong>The Temple as the Mind</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s framework, the <a href="building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html"><strong>temple symbolises your mind</strong> or consciousness—the place where your creative power resides</a>. When Jesus cleanses the temple, it represents cleansing your mind from negative or outdated thoughts that limit your ability to manifest your desires.</p><p>The temple should be a sacred space, focused on <strong>spiritual growth</strong>, manifestation, and aligning with your <strong>higher creative self</strong>.</p><hr/><h3><strong>The Merchants and Money Changers: False Values and Distractions</strong></h3><p>In the temple, <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> finds <strong>merchants</strong> and <strong>money changers</strong>—symbols of <strong>materialism</strong> and <strong>false values</strong>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>merchants</strong> represent thoughts focused on <strong>external achievements</strong> or distractions like <strong>money, status</strong>, and <strong>superficial success</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>money changers</strong> symbolise the exchange of <strong>false beliefs</strong>, where the focus is on <strong>external validation</strong> rather than inner creative power.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr/><h3><strong>Driving Out Distractions: Clearing the Mind</strong></h3><p>Jesus’ act of driving out the merchants and money changers represents the need to <strong>clear your mind</strong> of all distractions and false beliefs. Neville teaches that when you hold <strong>limiting assumptions</strong>, your manifestations become fragmented and misaligned.</p><p>Cleansing the temple is about <strong>releasing limiting beliefs</strong>—whether they’re about <strong>money, success</strong>, or <strong>self-worth</strong>—and replacing them with <strong>empowering, aligned assumptions</strong>.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Overturning the Tables: Disrupting Old Thought Patterns</strong></h3><p>The act of <strong>overturning the tables</strong> of the money changers signifies the need to <strong>disrupt old, limiting thought patterns</strong>. In Neville's view, this is the process of <strong>releasing outdated assumptions</strong> that hinder manifestation.</p><p>The tables represent the old structures of belief that no longer serve you. By overturning them, you break free from limiting patterns and begin to align your mind with your true desires.</p><hr/><h3><strong>A House of Prayer: Aligning with Divine Creation</strong></h3><p>After cleansing the temple, Jesus declares, "<strong>My house shall be a house of prayer</strong>."</p><p>In Neville's terms, this means that the mind (temple) is meant to be a <strong>sacred space for creation</strong>. Prayer here is not about asking, but about <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html"><strong>assuming the state of the wish fulfilled</strong>.</a></p><p>When your mind is cleansed and focused, it becomes a place where your thoughts and assumptions create your reality. The temple becomes a place of <strong>purposeful, conscious creation</strong>.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Jesus Cleanses the Temple: Across the Four Gospels</strong></h3><p>The account of Jesus cleansing the temple appears in all four Gospels — a rare narrative consistency that signals deep symbolic meaning. In Neville Goddard’s teachings, Jesus is the personification of imagination — the I AM — and the temple symbolises the mind. To cleanse the temple is to cast out all limiting assumptions, false ideas, and internal divisions that crowd the place where God (I AM) dwells.</p><p>Each Gospel corresponds to a <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">patriarchal archetype and a phase in the process of manifesting</a>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew (Abraham – Faith)</strong>: The clearing of the temple here represents the first step — a radical break from outer authority (the money changers) and a return to inner conviction. Like Abraham leaving his homeland, this is the beginning of faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mark (Jacob – Persistence)</strong>: Mark’s account is forceful and immediate. This is the relentless clearing out of old beliefs and recurring doubts — the wrestling with contradiction until only assumption remains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Luke (Joseph – Imagination)</strong>: Luke’s Gospel adds a sense of order and inner control. The cleansing here reflects the refinement of imagination — choosing what images are permitted to remain and rule the temple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John (Judah – Praise)</strong>: John frames the cleansing early in the Gospel, <a href="the-spiritual-significance-of-passover.html">linking it to Passover</a>. This signals a shift: the temple is no longer an external structure but the awareness of I AM. Praise becomes purification — affirming the holy nature of the self as the dwelling place of God.</p></li></ul><hr/><h3><strong>The Importance of Cleansing the Mind</strong></h3><p>Cleansing the temple is about <strong>maintaining a clear mind</strong> focused on your desires. Each Gospel’s account emphasises that <strong>continual purification</strong> of your thoughts is crucial to manifesting your true desires through the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>. The temple must be a <strong>sacred space</strong>, free of negativity, to allow imagination to create your reality.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
