<h1>Double Creation: The Law of Identical Harvest</h1>
<p>One of Neville Goddard’s most transformative teachings is the law of identical harvest — the principle that what you reap in life is not just similar to what you've <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">sown inwardly</a>, but identical in nature. It is the "<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM THAT I AM</a>". Your outer world mirrors your inner state of self-perception with unwavering precision. Just like nature, this law is exact and impartial: the seed you plant in imagination bears <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">fruit after its own kind.</a></p><h3>Double Creation: The Inner and Outer Realms</h3><p>Neville often highlighted what many see as a contradiction in Genesis — yet he saw it as a revelation of the structure of reality itself.</p><p>In Genesis 1, creation is declared finished:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.”</p>
</blockquote><p>But in Genesis 2:5, we read:</p><blockquote>
<p>“No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This, Neville taught, reveals the mystery of manifestation: creation happens twice. First, in the unseen, imaginal realm — the world of cause. Then, in the visible, physical realm — the world of effect.</p><p>In his words: <em>“Imagining creates reality.”</em> The true act of creation is imaginal. Rain symbolises emotional acceptance, and the ground represents the subconscious mind. Once an idea is felt as true and accepted, it must express itself. The outer world cannot help but mirror what has already been conceived within.</p><h3>The Seed Produces After Its Kind</h3><p>Genesis 1:11 clarifies this law unmistakably:</p><blockquote>
<p>“The fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself...”</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the law of identical harvest. Every inward state, assumed and felt, carries the complete blueprint of the experience it will produce. You cannot plant one seed and reap another.</p><p>Neville insisted that imagination is not idle fancy — it is creative power. Whatever you dwell upon inwardly, especially when felt as real, becomes the seed of your future. Persist in fear, and you reap fear. Persist in abundance, and you reap abundance. The world does not mock you — it reflects you.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Dare to assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and let it clothe itself in flesh.”</p>
</blockquote><p>To live "from the end" is not merely to think of the desired state, but to occupy it inwardly until it feels natural. The seed is then sown. Once accepted by the subconscious, the harvest is certain.</p><h3>Repetition in Scripture: The Symbol of Certainty</h3><p>The Bible underscores this law through repetition, which signals inner establishment and the certainty of manifestation.</p><p>In Genesis 41, Pharaoh dreams twice. Joseph explains:</p><blockquote>
<p>“And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.”</p>
</blockquote><p>For Neville, this repetition confirms that a state is accepted inwardly and will inevitably externalise.</p><p>Similarly, in Paul's letters (for example, 2 Corinthians 11:11 and 12:2–3), we see repeated affirmations like "God knows." To Neville, "God" symbolises the creative consciousness — the divine imagination. These repeated declarations are not mere style; they affirm inner certainty. Once the seed is firmly planted, its identical harvest must follow.</p><h3>Delay Is Not Denial</h3><p>A frequent stumbling block is the apparent delay between assumption and manifestation. This is not failure but the necessary gestation period — as Ecclesiastes 3:1 declares:</p><blockquote>
<p>“To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.”</p>
</blockquote><p>The seed, once sown, requires time to mature. Neville reminds us:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Creation is finished. It is your perception of it that must be adjusted. All things exist now.”</p>
</blockquote><p>The delay is part of the natural process; patience and faith in the law are essential.</p><h3>Change the Seed, Change the Harvest</h3><p>This law serves both as a caution and an invitation. If your current life is a painful harvest, Neville would not advise fighting the effects — he would guide you to change the cause.</p><p>Change the seed. Change your self-concept and assumptions. Dwell in the new state until it feels real — and allow the harvest to unfold naturally.</p><p>You are always sowing, whether through your inner conversations, reactions, or silent assumptions. The question is not whether the law works — it always does. The only question is: <em>What are you planting?</em></p><h3>Practical Implication: Live From the End</h3><p>Assume health, and you sow health.<br/>
Assume abundance, and you sow abundance.<br/>
Assume love, and you sow loving relationships.</p><p>Whatever you consistently accept as true inwardly will appear outwardly in its own time.</p><h3>Final Thought</h3><p>The law of identical harvest is not superstition or wishful thinking — it is spiritual law. Your consciousness is the creative force; the world is your harvest. As Neville puts it, <em>“Your world is your harvest.”</em></p><p>You are always sowing — make sure you are planting what you truly wish to reap.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-genesis-1-series.html">Genesis 1 Series</a> | <a href="label-genesis-1-11-series.html">Genesis 1:11 Series</a> | <a href="label-law-of-identical-harvest.html">Law of Identical Harvest</a></p>
