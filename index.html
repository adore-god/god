    <h1 style="font-weight:600">The Bible's Revelation 
of God, Man, Woman, Love & Sin</h1>
<h2 style="font-size:1.1em; text-align:center;font-weight:500">Set in the <br> kingdom of the mind</h2> 
    <p class="lead">
      God, the Lord, and the forces of the mind—judges, kings, and rulers—are revealed in a story of imagination, love, and the unfolding of consciousness. 
      This is the greatest love story ever told: the <a class="foundational-verse b7"  href="el/bible-kingdom-structure.html">kingdom within you</a>, guided by faith, delight, and assumption.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      The Bible's narrative is presented within the structure of a kingdom, with the Lord presiding as the eternal ruler within you, and judges, kings, and rulers guiding the affairs of your mind. 
      Through its narrative, over 3,000 years ago, natural landmarks, events, and human characters were used to show how the kingdom of the inner mind functions. 
      It teaches that imagination is God, acting through the judges and rulers of your mind to shape reality, and reveals how to govern it through 
      <a class="foundational-verse b7" href="jesus-paradise-pleasure-and-abundance.html">delight, faith, and love</a>. 
      </p>
 
    <p>
      Whatever you cleave to and dwell upon in your mind, the Bible declares, will come to pass as experience in your outer world. 
      </p>
 
    <p>
      This kingdom unfolds from a few 
      <a class="foundational-verse b7" href="genesis-foundational-principles.html">foundational verses in Genesis</a>, 
      and Neville Goddard shows that the Bible is the law of assumption, guiding you in how to 
      <a class="foundational-verse b7" href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">'ask, believe, receive'</a> in the governance of your own inner kingdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout history, all spiritual systems—tarot, metaphysics, and archetypes—draw inspiration from the Bible and echo its revelation of imagination as God.
