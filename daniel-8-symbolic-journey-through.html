<h1>Daniel's Visions of a Goat and Ram</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">


<p>Daniel 8 is not an outer history but an inward drama of mind. In Neville Goddard’s terms, it reveals the struggle between two inner powers: the stubborn, entrenched reasoning of the old self and the fresh, unified vision of a new assumption. Through the symbolism of the ram and the goat, the chapter also echoes Eden — <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">the choice between the <em>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</em> (division) and the <em>Tree of Life</em> (unity).</a></p>
<hr>
<h3>Daniel’s Vision Begins: The Witness Awakens</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me… I was at Shushan in the palace… by the river of Ulai."</em> (Daniel 8:1–2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Daniel" is a <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> who represents the awakened imagination — the witness within who becomes conscious of the creative process of thought. "Shushan" points to a refined, fragrant inner state; "Ulai" is the spiritual current of awareness. The "third year" marks a phase of completion, where the mind is prepared to receive a deeper truth. These <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">visions are the imaginal acts themselves — moments where the inner eye opens.</a></p>
<hr>
<h3>The Ram with Two Horns: The Mind of Division</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns… the higher came up last… he pushed westward, and northward, and southward… and became great."</em> (Daniel 8:3–4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ram is the <a href="scrolls/label-shepherd-and-lamb-series.html" class="noTag">adult male sheep</a> — strong, stubborn, and unwilling to be led under a new will. Its <strong>two horns</strong> symbolise the divided mind of the <em>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</em> — the habit of seeing in opposites: possible/impossible, good/bad, faith/fear. One horn rising above the other shows how one belief (<a href="genesis-47-sin.html">often fear or limitation</a>) can overtake another until it rules entirely.</p>
<p>This ram pushes in all directions, extending division into every area of life. It is the entrenched self-concept, a state that thrives on judging, weighing, and maintaining the familiar.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Goat Appears: The Mind of Unity</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Behold, an he goat came from the west… and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes."</em> (Daniel 8:5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goat bursts onto the scene as an agile, undomesticated challenger. Its <strong>single horn</strong> mirrors the <em>Tree of Life</em> — one undivided intention, focused between the eyes, the seat of inner vision. This is imagination acting without reference to the senses. Coming "from the west" points to its origin in the hidden, subconscious realm. It does not touch the ground because it is not yet manifest; it lives purely in the imaginal.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Clash: Unity Confronts Division</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"And he came to the ram… and brake his two horns… and cast him down to the ground."</em> (Daniel 8:6–7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the single-intent goat collides with the divided ram. The horns of division are shattered — meaning the habit of judging and splitting experience is destroyed. The ram falls; the old stubborn state loses its rule. Neville taught that persistence in the new assumption inevitably dethrones the old.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Great Horn Breaks: Releasing the Act</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."</em> (Daniel 8:8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the peak of imaginal strength, the single horn breaks — a symbol of surrender. You have felt the wish fulfilled and let it go. The four new horns represent the spreading of this unified state into all quarters of consciousness. The seed is sown.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Little Horn: The Return of Division</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Out of one of them came forth a little horn… and it cast down some of the host and of the stars."</em> (Daniel 8:9–10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even after unity is planted, division can creep back. The "little horn" is the small but insistent voice of doubt — the old mind of the Tree of Knowledge trying to reassert itself. It casts down your higher thoughts (stars) into the realm of sense, tempting you back into judgement and duality.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Daily Sacrifice Removed: Abandoning Unity</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"By him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down… and it cast down the truth to the ground."</em> (Daniel 8:11–12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "daily sacrifice" is your regular imaginal discipline — the conscious choice to remain at the Tree of Life, holding to the single vision. When doubt grows, this practice stops. The sanctuary (your imagination) is "cast down" when sense evidence is treated as final. This is the triumph of division over unity — but only temporarily.</p>
<hr>
<h3>"How Long?" — Time as the Voice of Division</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"How long…?" … ‘Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.’</em> (Daniel 8:13–14)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asking "how long?" belongs to the divided mind — the Tree of Knowledge, which looks to time and conditions. The "2,300 days" is symbolic: the sanctuary (imagination) is cleansed when the single vision feels as natural as breathing. Unity is restored when the mind stops counting the days.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Gabriel Explains: The Inner Interpreter</h3>
<p>Gabriel represents inner wisdom, revealing that the ram and goat are not outer kings but inner states. The ram is the divided mind of judgement; the goat is the unified mind of life. The "king of fierce countenance" is reasoning that resists the imaginal, yet even this will fade as unity becomes the only nature.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Daniel is Exhausted: The Cost of Leaving Division</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business."</em> (Daniel 8:27)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving from the Tree of Knowledge to the Tree of Life is a death to the old self. This fainting is the collapse of the familiar mental order. But Daniel rises again to do "the king’s business" — sustaining the single vision, even when others do not understand.</p>
<hr>
