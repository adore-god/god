<h1>Micah and Michael: Who is Like God? I AM!</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In the Bible, the names Micah and Michael both ask the same question: <em>“Who is like God?”</em> Yet, they represent two stages of spiritual awakening—Micah as the seeking soul and Michael as the realised divine self. Through Neville Goddard’s teachings, this journey mirrors the shift from asking <em><b>Who is like God?</b></em> to answering with the divine name revealed in Exodus 3:14: <i>“</i><b><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM THAT I AM</a></b><i>.”</i> In other words—<b><i>Who is like God? I AM!</i></b></p><hr><h2>Micah: The Seeker of Divinity</h2><blockquote>
<p>“There was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.”<br>
— Judges 17:1</p>
</blockquote><p>In Judges 17, we meet Micah, from the tribe of Ephraim, <a href="the-signature-in-hebrew-names-how-yah.html">whose name</a> (מִיכָה, <em>Mikha</em>) comes from <em>Micaiah</em> (מִיכָיָה), meaning <em>“Who is like Yah?”</em> or <em>“Who is like the Lord?”</em> This question captures the soul’s yearning for divinity.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, Micah symbolises the part of us that seeks spiritual truth but still believes God to be external. Micah’s story—making idols and hiring a Levite priest—shows a soul searching for God in outward forms rather than recognising the inner source of all creation.</p><p>At this stage, the question <em>“Who is like God?”</em> remains unanswered. The seeker hasn’t yet heard, within their own consciousness, the voice that said to Moses in Exodus 3:14, <em>“I AM THAT I AM.”</em></p><hr><h2>Michael: The Defender of the Assumption</h2><blockquote>
<p>“And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon…”<br>
— Revelation 12:7</p>
</blockquote><p>The name Michael (מִיכָאֵל, <em>Mikha’el</em>) also means <em>“<b>Who is like God?</b>”</em>—but here, the answer is known. The suffix <em>El</em> signals the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">full recognition of God’s indwelling presence.</a></p><p>Michael, in Neville Goddard’s symbolism, represents the realised state—the “<b><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></b>” fully accepted as the source of all creation. Michael defends the assumption of the wish fulfilled, protecting it from doubt and the “dragons” of contradictory evidence.</p><p>This is the inner warrior who, having realised <em>“<b><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></b>”</em> is God, holds to the feeling of fulfilment until it hardens into fact. Where Micah asks the question, Michael embodies the answer.</p><hr><h2>The Path from Micah to Michael: From Seeking to Knowing</h2><p>The transformation from Micah to Michael is the shift from wondering <em>Who is like God?</em> to realising: <em>I AM.</em> This is the pivot of the spiritual journey—the moment when Exodus 3:14 moves from scripture on a page to the living truth of your own being.</p><p>Micah symbolises the external search. Michael is the consciousness that knows the creative power of imagination is the “God in the midst” of you. Neville’s teaching makes the path clear:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Micah stage</strong> — you seek, you question, you search for the divine in outer forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Michael stage</strong> — you recognise your own “I AM” as the only God and protect that assumption until it manifests.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr><h2>Conclusion: I AM the Answer</h2><p>The journey from Micah to Michael is the awakening from spiritual seeking to spiritual knowing. It is the discovery that the question <em>“Who is like God?”</em> has only one true answer—<em>I AM.</em></p><p>Through Neville Goddard’s teachings, we see that this “I AM” is the creative power of imagination. When you step into Michael’s role, you not only know this truth, you defend it—standing guard over your assumptions until they become your lived reality.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
