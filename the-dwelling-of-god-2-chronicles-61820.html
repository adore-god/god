<h1>Solomon: The Infinite Within the Finite</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p></p><blockquote><p><strong>“But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this temple which I have built!”</strong><br/>
<strong>“Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Lord my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You:</strong><br/>
<strong>that Your eyes may be open toward this temple day and night, toward the place where You said You would put Your name, that You may hear the prayer which Your servant makes toward this place.”</strong><br/>
— <em>2 Chronicles 6:18–20, NKJV</em></p>
</blockquote><hr/><h3><strong>The Infinite Within the Finite</strong></h3><p>Solomon, in his dedication of the temple, voices a question that touches the very heart of spiritual mystery:<br/>
<strong>Can the Infinite dwell with the finite?</strong></p><p>From the perspective of Neville Goddard, the answer is a bold and transformative yes—<strong>but not in the way tradition might expect</strong>. God is not found in a physical dwelling, however majestic.<br/>
<strong><a href="genesis-126-man.html">God is found in man</a>—more specifically, in man’s own wonderful human imagination.</strong></p><p>When Solomon acknowledges that “heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You,” it confirms Neville’s central claim: <strong><a href="elohim-god.html">God is awareness itself</a></strong>, not limited by form but expressed through it.</p><hr/><h3><strong>The Temple as the Mind. </strong><strong>How To Dwell and Abide in God</strong></h3><p>Solomon’s temple becomes a powerful symbol for the <strong>human mind</strong>, the dwelling place of consciousness.<br/>
It is in your <em>assumptions</em>, your <em>inner speech</em>, and your <em>felt identity</em> that God—the I AM—takes up residence.</p><p>Neville’s Law of Assumption teaches that your reality conforms to your inner state. What you persistently assume to be true becomes your lived experience.</p><blockquote>
<p>“That Your eyes may be open toward this temple day and night…”<br/>
This can be understood as keeping your attention fixed on your desired state—<strong>your inner temple</strong>.</p>
</blockquote><p>You become the “servant praying toward this place” every time you turn inward and commune with the reality you choose to inhabit, regardless of outer appearances.</p><hr/><h3><strong>The Name and the Place</strong></h3><p>Solomon also mentions the temple as the place where God said He would “put His name.” In Neville’s framework, the <strong>name of God is “I AM.”</strong> This is not a label, but a declaration of being.</p><blockquote>
<p>Whenever you say, “I am…” followed by any assumption, you are using the name of God—<strong>claiming a state of consciousness</strong>.</p>
</blockquote><p>Thus, the temple where God puts His name is not built by hands, but built by identity. It is the <strong>I AM consciousness</strong> in you—alive, aware, and creative.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Temple is You</strong></h3><p>2 Chronicles 6:18–20, read through the insight of Neville Goddard, becomes more than a historical account of a king and a building—it is a living reminder that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>God dwells with man as imagination</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prayer is attention persistently focused</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The temple is the inner state where you feel yourself to be the thing hoped for</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><p>When you honour that place within you—when you keep your eyes (your awareness) fixed on that sacred assumption—<strong>the Divine dwells there, hears you, and responds.</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>“I AM” is the true temple. Keep it holy.</p></blockquote><div class="share-dropdown">
