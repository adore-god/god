<h1>John: I AM the True Vine</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In John 15:1&ndash;17, Jesus&mdash;symbolising the awakened imagination&mdash;speaks to his <a href="elohim-god.html">disciples</a>, who represent various faculties of the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">inner man</a>. This isn&rsquo;t a historical instruction to a group of men. It is the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> within you, addressing your own thoughts, desires, fears, and assumptions. Through Neville Goddard&rsquo;s teachings and poetic echoes from the <em>Song of Solomon</em>, we can read this passage as the soul&rsquo;s guide to conscious manifestation, inner unity, and spiritual fruitfulness.</p><p><strong>John 15:1&ndash;2</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I AM the true vine and my Father is the gardener. He takes away every branch in me which does not give fruit: and every branch which gives fruit he makes clean, so that it may give more fruit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>The vine is imagination&mdash;source of all reality. The Father, your deeper consciousness, removes assumptions that do not bear fruit and strengthens those that do. Pruning is the natural process of self-correction: not punishment, but refinement.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 1:14:</em> &ldquo;My love is to me as a branch of the cypress-tree in the vine-gardens of En-gedi.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:3</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You are clean, even now, through the teaching which I have given you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>You are cleansed by inner conviction&mdash;by aligning your self-concept with your chosen assumption. The word is not external; it is the assumption accepted as true.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 4:3:</em> &ldquo;Your lips are like a thread of red, and your mouth is lovely.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:4&ndash;5</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Be in me at all times as I AM in you... I AM the vine, you are the branches...&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>Remain in the state of the wish fulfilled. A branch cannot bear fruit unless it abides in the vine; likewise, you cannot manifest unless you dwell in the assumption of already being.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 6:3:</em> &ldquo;I AM for my loved one, and my loved one is for me.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:6</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If a man does not keep himself in me, he becomes dead...&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>When you detach from the imagined end, you fall back into the lifelessness of unfulfilled desire. Staying connected to the vine is staying faithful to your vision.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 5:7:</em> &ldquo;They took away my robe from me, those who kept the watch on the walls.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:7</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you are in me... anything you have a desire for will be done for you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the Law of Assumption in action. When imagination and belief are united, manifestation follows.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 2:6:</em> &ldquo;His left hand is under my head, and his right hand is about me.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:8</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Here is my Father's glory, in that you give much fruit...&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>Manifestation is the natural expression of the divine within. When your assumptions become reality, it glorifies the one source&mdash;your I AM.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 2:13:</em> &ldquo;The fig-tree puts out her green figs&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:9&ndash;10</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Be ever in my love. If you keep my laws, you will be ever in my love&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>Love is fidelity to your assumption. The &ldquo;law&rdquo; is not moral regulation, but psychological discipline&mdash;remaining in the feeling of the wish fulfilled.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 8:7:</em> &ldquo;Much water may not put out love&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:11</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So that your joy may be complete.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>Joy is the result of harmony between the inner state and the outer world. Joy is not chased&mdash;it is allowed.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 7:12:</em> &ldquo;Let us go out early to the vine-gardens&hellip; let us see if the vines are in flower.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:12&ndash;13</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is the law I give you: Have love one for another...&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the heart of the passage. Neville taught that Scripture is psychological. &ldquo;Love one another&rdquo; is an inward command: Love every part of your Self. Love your contradictions, your doubts, your faculties. Unite them in a single purpose. When your inner man no longer fights itself, manifestation becomes inevitable.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 4:7:</em> &ldquo;You are all fair, my love; there is no mark on you.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:14&ndash;15</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You are my friends&hellip; no longer servants&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>The faculties of the mind evolve. When they obey only unconsciously, they are &ldquo;servants.&rdquo; But when they act in harmony with the I AM, they become &ldquo;friends&rdquo;&mdash;aware, deliberate creators.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 2:10:</em> &ldquo;My loved one said to me, Get up&hellip; come away.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:16</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You did not take me for yourselves, but I took you for myself&hellip; whatever request you make to the Father in my name, he will give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>Desire arises within you not as a whim, but as a calling. To ask &ldquo;in my name&rdquo; is to identify with the state desired. It is already yours.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 3:4:</em> &ldquo;I took him by the arm, and would not let him go&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><strong>John 15:17</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So this is my law for you: Have love one for another.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>This concluding verse underscores the command: Love all aspects of the Self. Harmonise your thoughts. Let no inner faculty rebel. As Neville would say:<br/>
&ldquo;Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and persist in that assumption.&rdquo;<br/>
This is the fruit of the vine.<br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 8:6:</em> &ldquo;Put me as a sign on your heart, as a sign on your arm&hellip;&rdquo;</p><div class="share-dropdown">
