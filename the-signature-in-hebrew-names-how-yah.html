<h1>Yah, Iah, and El in Names: Identifiers of the  I AM</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The Bible is written as a visionary picture of how <a href="elohim-god.html">imagination operates through many different states of mind</a>. Rather than being a single theological statement, it is a collection of perspectives expressed through <a href="genesis-126-man.html">men</a> and <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">women</a>, characters and books, each showing how inner assumptions shape outer experience. In this way, Scripture teaches how the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Law of Assumption</a> is enacted through imagination and its many faculties.</p>

<p>A key to understanding this lies in biblical names, especially those ending in <strong>-yah</strong>, <strong>-iah</strong>, and <strong>-el</strong>. These are not decorative endings. They point directly to the imaginative power Neville Goddard calls the <strong>“I AM”</strong>—imagination itself. The characters bearing these names represent specific modes or functions of imagination at work.</p>

<p>This is why <a href="/search/label/Genealogy%20Series">genealogies matter so much</a> in the Bible, particularly in the <a href="the-lineage-of-christ-journey-through.html">lineage of Jesus</a>. They are not biological records but ordered descriptions of developing mental states, showing how imagination progresses from one assumption to another.</p>

<h2>What “-yah,” “-iah,” and “-el” Indicate</h2>

<p><strong>-yah</strong> and <strong>-iah</strong> are shortened forms of <strong>Yahweh (YHWH)</strong>, which corresponds to the statement <strong>“I AM”</strong> in Exodus 3:14 (<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM THAT I AM</a>). Names with these endings indicate that the character represents an active state of self-awareness—the imagination recognising itself as the cause.</p>

<p><strong>-el</strong> means <strong>“God”</strong> or <strong>“mighty one”</strong> and is connected to <a href="elohim-god.html"><strong>Elohim</strong></a>, often understood as creative power expressed. Names ending in <strong>-el</strong> point to imagination exercising authority, strength, or direction.</p>

<h2>Examples as Mental Functions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Isaiah:</strong> “I AM is salvation” — imagination recognising itself as the means of change.</li>
  <li><strong>Jeremiah:</strong> “I AM will raise” — a state where imagination lifts or restructures identity.</li>
  <li><strong>Hezekiah:</strong> “Strength of I AM” — stabilised confidence in the creative power.</li>
  <li><strong>Michael:</strong> “Who is like God?” — affirmation that no external cause rivals imagination.</li>
  <li><strong>Ezekiel:</strong> “God strengthens” — imagination being reinforced to sustain a new state.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not historical personalities in the psychological sense Neville describes, but named functions of imagination. Each one shows how a particular assumption operates, develops, or stabilises within consciousness. The full sequence of these modes can be seen in the <a href="the-lineage-of-christ-journey-through.html">symbolic lineage of Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Jesus as the Central Principle</h2>

<p>The name <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html"><strong>Jesus</strong> (Yeshua / Yehoshua) means <strong>“I AM saves.”</strong></a> In Neville Goddard’s framework, Jesus is not a separate external figure but the point at which imagination fully recognises itself as the source of reality.</p>

<p>Jesus represents imagination awakened to its own power—the state where assumption is no longer questioned but lived from.</p>

<h2>One Law, Many Expressions</h2>

<p>Whether a name ends in <strong>-yah</strong>, <strong>-iah</strong>, or <strong>-el</strong>, the meaning always resolves back to the same principle: imagination as the creative cause. The different names simply describe different ways this power functions—initiating, strengthening, directing, or fulfilling an assumption.</p>

<h2>Why This Understanding Matters</h2>

<p>When biblical names are read symbolically, the Bible stops being a book about distant figures and becomes a manual of inner mechanics. It shows how imagination moves through many mindsets, how assumptions are formed, tested, and stabilised, and how identity itself is reshaped.</p>

<p>Seen this way, Scripture is a structured teaching on the Law of Assumption—expressed through named states of consciousness, each demonstrating how imagination brings experience into form.</p>
