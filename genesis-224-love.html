<h1>Genesis 2:24: LOVE</h1>

<div class="container">
  <main class="content">
    <img alt="Love Icon The Way" src="images/wp/heart.webp">
    <blockquote>
      The Bible, when read rightly, was meant to be the greatest love story ever told—about the reader—and to show man how to attain his deepest desires.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <a href="only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard</a> taught that the Bible is not a historical account, but a psychological drama — 
      <a href="elohim-god.html"><b>a symbolic unfolding of the inner world and its divine imagination</b></a>. Its verses speak in symbols, tracing the movement of 
      <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> through longing, identity, union, and transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most quietly pivotal verses on <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-24-series.html"><b>love</b></a> in the narrative is Genesis 2:24:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is not a description of physical <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-marriage-series.html" target="_blank">marriage</a>. <b>It is the psychological-emotional structure behind every transformation in the Bible</b>. It is a symbolic instruction: To “leave father and mother” means to break from inherited thought patterns and subconscious conditioning — the familiar framework of belief represented in stories like <a href="breaking-establishment.html">Laban</a>. The <b>“<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">wife</a>” is the state one longs to embody</b>, the assumption of the wish fulfilled. To “<b>be joined</b>” to her is to <b>cleave</b> or <b><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html">"crucified"</a></b> to that desired state in imagination — and to remain faithful to it, no matter what the senses say. And when the two become “<b>one flesh</b>,” it means the imagined state has been fully accepted and impressed upon the subconscious — it is now expressed outwardly as physical fact. In Neville Goddard’s terminology, the state has moved from assumption to embodiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To <em><b>“<a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-24-series.html">cleave</a></b>”</em> in this way is an act of love in its deepest biblical sense. In Neville’s framework, love is not mere affection — it is the union of the self with the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">desired state</a>. Love, here, is not passive; it is the <em>cleaving</em> force of assumption. You do not simply think about your desire — you become inwardly <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-marriage-series.html">married</a> to it.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
      But this cleaving does not come easily. In a world trained to value struggle over surrender, criticism over creativity, and survival over joy, it can feel unnatural — even <a href="the-foolishness-of-god-neville-goddard.html">foolish</a> — to break from inherited stress patterns and step into what we love. We are <b>conditioned by habit minds</b>, reinforced by cultural noise, taught to distrust ease and defer desire. The world says be realistic; the soul says be faithful. And so, the inner work of leaving father and mother — that is, shedding the familiar identity formed by society, trauma, and tradition — becomes one of the greatest spiritual challenges. To cleave to a new state requires not just vision, but courage — to <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-24-series.html"><b>love</b></a> what is possible more than we fear what is familiar. This is why love, in the biblical sense, is an act of faith: a bold refusal to keep living by the old name.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the same inner marriage explored in the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">mystery of <em>ask, believe, receive</em></a> — <b>where asking is desire, believing is cleaving, and receiving is the becoming of one flesh</b>. It is <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-24-series.html">love</a> that makes manifestation inevitable, for love is the fusion of imagination and feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-24-series.html">This pattern</a> — from leaving, to cleaving, to becoming — pulses through the entire biblical narrative. And most powerfully, it is saturated with <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-24-series.html">love</a> and desire — not as sin, but as divine longing.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Paul's Mysteries</h3>
    <p><a href="putting-on-new-man-bibles-secret-law.html">Paul repeats the mystery again</a> in another manner while echoing the '<a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed in itself</a>' (Genesis 1:11), and '<a href="genesis-126-man.html">man in His Image</a>' (Genesis 1:26):</p>
    <blockquote>
      "That you are to put away, in relation to your earlier way of life, the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">old man</a>, which is completely turned to evil desires; And be made new in the spirit of your mind, And put on the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">new man</a>, to which God has given life, in righteousness and a true and holy way of living."— Ephesians 4:22–24

    <h3>The Garden, the Bride, and the Song of Desire</h3>
    <p>In the <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-song-of-solomon-series.html" target="_blank">Song of Solomon</a>, this same pattern is no longer hidden — it becomes luminous.</p>
    <p>The <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-bride---bridegroom-series.html" target="_blank">bride</a> is both a <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a> and a <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-eden-series.html">garden</a>. Her presence evokes <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-eden-series.html" target="_blank">Eden</a>, not as a memory but as a living desire:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.”<br>
      <em>(Song of Solomon 4:12)</em></p>
