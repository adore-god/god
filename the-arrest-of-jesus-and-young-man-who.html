<h1>The Arrest of Jesus and the Young Man Who Flees: When Assumption is Arrested </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The account of <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a>’ arrest in Gethsemane, especially the moment a young man flees naked, holds deep symbolic meaning when seen through Neville Goddard’s teachings on manifestation.</p><p>In Neville’s interpretation, <strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> represents the imagination active in assumption</strong>, the creative power within us. <strong>Judas</strong> symbolises the old self — limiting beliefs and doubts that betray our new assumptions and visions.</p><h2>Judas: The Old Self</h2><p><a href="judah-and-judas-two-paths-to-same.html">Judas</a>' betrayal mirrors how our old thoughts and fears undermine the state of the new assumption. These Judas-like thoughts must be released if the imagination (Jesus) is to guide us fully.</p><p>The <strong>30 pieces of silver</strong> represent the temporary value we place on doubt and external evidence — the “price” we pay when we choose fear over faith in imagination. But this price is always short-lived and ultimately meaningless compared to the true creative power within.</p><h2>Jesus’ Arrest: Imagination Captured</h2><p><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a>’ arrest symbolises those moments when imagination feels “taken prisoner” by fear or external obstacles. During manifestation, we may feel the vision slip or seem threatened by old beliefs. This conflict is temporary; imagination can never be permanently subdued.</p><h2>The Young Man: Manifestation in Motion</h2><p>In Mark 14:51–52, a young man following Jesus flees and leaves behind a linen cloth. He symbolises our manifestation (personified as <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-david-series.html">David</a> earlier in the narrative) — the vision we are birthing through imagination.</p><p>His <strong>nakedness</strong> reflects vulnerability. Like Adam and Eve, whose nakedness revealed their awareness of separation. When doubts arise, the manifestation can feel “lost” or fragile.</p><p>The <a href="the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">linen cloth</a> left behind shows that the vision was once fully held but appears to slip away when we revert to the old self. Yet, the young man’s escape suggests the manifestation remains in motion — not destroyed, only temporarily out of sight.</p><h2>Temporary Loss and Return</h2><p>This fleeting loss is part of the journey. Manifestations can feel distant when old beliefs (Judas) resurface. The key is to persist. The cloth is a reminder that what we imagined remains alive. The young man’s flight is not a defeat but a transitional phase — the desire is still active and will return when aligned fully with the new assumption.</p><h2>Trusting the Process</h2><p>Through this story, Neville highlights that even when imagination feels arrested or manifestations seem lost, they are never truly gone. The process is non-linear and requires trust.</p><p>The young man’s nakedness calls us to remain vulnerable yet steadfast, knowing that the vision will ultimately take form when we release the old self completely.</p><hr/><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The arrest, betrayal, and fleeing young man illustrate the inner dynamics of manifestation: the battle with old beliefs, the temporary retreat of desires, and the ultimate triumph of imagination. Even when the process feels interrupted, the vision remains alive — waiting for us to claim it fully.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
