<h1>Psalm 139:<br/>Closeness To God</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Psalm 139 is a popular psalm because it talks about being close to God (<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">the judges of rulers of your "I AM that I AM"</a>). Through Neville Goddard’s teachings, we see that God is not someone outside of you. “God” is your imagination, your "I AM"—the assumptive power within you. This psalm is really about recognising that your awareness shapes your reality and directs your life.</p>
<p>Understanding this psalm through the Law of Assumption helps us see that your imagination is always working. You are always <a href="genesis-126-man.html">assuming a state of being</a>—either consciously or unconsciously. The key is to become aware of it and assume what you want to experience as real.</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">The Lord means your own “I AM” — the awareness you are giving authority to right now</a>.
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“O Lord, you have searched me, and you know me.”  
— <em>Psalm 139:1</em>
</blockquote>
<p>This means your imagination knows you completely. Every thought, desire, and belief is already part of your inner world. If you assume that your creative power is guiding you toward what you want, you can align with it and see it appear in your life.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“You know my sitting down and my rising up, you understand my thought from afar.”  
— <em>Psalm 139:2</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Your imagination is aware of everything you do, think, and feel. “Thoughts from afar” are the ideas coming from your subconscious. If you deliberately assume good outcomes and positive states, your inner power works to make them real.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“You have made my going and my resting, and are acquainted with all my ways.”  
— <em>Psalm 139:3</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything you do is shaped by your assumptions. Neville teaches that your life moves according to what your imagination assumes to be true. By consciously choosing your assumptions, you direct your path.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, you know it altogether.”  
— <em>Psalm 139:4</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Your words reflect what you assume inside. If you speak as if your desires are already real, you reinforce the assumption and strengthen the power of your imagination to make them happen.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“You have set me behind and before, and laid your hand upon me.”  
— <em>Psalm 139:5</em>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows that your inner creative power surrounds you at all times. The “hand” is your imagination guiding you. Assume it is leading you toward what you want, and you will notice opportunities appearing in your life.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.”  
— <em>Psalm 139:6</em>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be surprising how much your imagination can create. You may not see the full picture, but even a simple assumption, repeated and felt as real, produces results.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“Where shall I go from your spirit? or where shall I flee from your presence?”  
— <em>Psalm 139:7</em>
</blockquote>
<p>You cannot escape your own assumptions. Your inner awareness is always shaping your reality. Choose assumptions deliberately to create the life you want.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“If I ascend up into heaven, you are there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there.”  
— <em>Psalm 139:8</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether you feel good or bad, your imagination is still at work. By assuming positive states as real, you can shift any situation to align with what you want.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall your hand lead me, and your right hand shall hold me.”  
— <em>Psalm 139:9–10</em>
</blockquote>
<p>No matter where you are—trying something new or dealing with old beliefs—your imagination is guiding you. Keep assuming the state you want, and it will manifest.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.”  
— <em>Psalm 139:11</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when life feels dark or uncertain, your assumptions create light. Assume positive outcomes and stay focused on what you want, and your inner power will move things into reality.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
“For you have possessed my reins: you have covered me in my mother's womb.”  
— <em>Psalm 139:13</em>
</blockquote>
<p>From the start of your life, your imagination has been shaping your experience. Recognising and consciously using your imagination through the Law of Assumption gives you control over your life.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Using the Law of Assumption</strong></h3>
<p>Psalm 139 shows that your inner creative power is always present and shaping your reality. By understanding that “the Lord” is your imagination, you can deliberately assume the states you want and see them appear. Every thought, word, and feeling matters because it reinforces the state you are assuming.</p>
<p>Trust in the Law of Assumption: assume your desired state is already real, feel it, and let your inner awareness—the Lord—bring it into your experience. This is the real closeness to God, experienced inside your own consciousness.</p>
