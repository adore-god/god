<h1>Last Supper: Feeding the Assumption </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<blockquote> 
"Jesus answered them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves'." — John 6:26
</blockquote> 
<p>To the literalist, the Last Supper in the Gospels is a historical meal shared by Jesus and his disciples before his crucifixion. But through the revelatory insight of Neville Goddard, this moment is not about bread and wine on a table in the past—it is the <a href="elohim-god.html">drama of consciousness</a>, a mystical act of aligning with one’s inner reality.  Furthermore, this scene and Jesus's ministry in general, bears many symbolic similarities with the initial story of <a href="joseph-and-jesus-patterns-of-fulfilment.html">Joseph and his brothers.</a></p>
<p>The story of the Last Supper is found in all four Gospels, but its symbolic essence shines most vividly when we understand it as the final act before an inner transformation: the fixing of an assumption in the imagination, which Neville calls the true crucifixion.</p>
<hr>
<p></p><blockquote>"And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me." (Luke 22:19)</blockquote><p></p>
<p>In Neville’s interpretation, bread symbolises the substance of belief—your assumptions. When Jesus breaks the bread and shares it, he is teaching that your body, your life, is made up of what you inwardly accept as true. To partake of the bread is to take into yourself a <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">new assumption</a>. The breaking is the moment of division between your old self and your new state.</p>
<p>To "do this in remembrance of me" is to remember the power of <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>—that God is your own imagination. Every time you fix your consciousness in a new state, you are partaking in the Last Supper. You are eating and drinking your new reality.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>"Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you." (Luke 22:20)</blockquote>
<p>Wine, in this symbolism, is the lifeblood of the assumption. Neville often equated blood with the imaginative act. It is the life-force that runs through the idea once accepted. The "new testament" is not a book—it is a new covenant between your conscious and subconscious selves. It is the agreement that whatever is accepted in imagination will be outpictured in the world.</p>
<p>To drink the wine is to internalise this new agreement. It is to emotionally commit to the state you have assumed. This is no mere ritual; it is a spiritual transaction.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>"But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table." (Luke 22:21)</blockquote>
<p><a href="judah-and-judas-two-paths-to-same.html">Judas</a>, in Neville’s vision, is not a villain but a necessary function in the drama of manifestation. He represents the moment you let go and allow the assumed state to be betrayed into the world. To betray is to release. Judas is the act of handing over the idea from imagination into reality. Without Judas, there is no crucifixion—no fixing of the idea—and therefore, no resurrection into form.</p>
<p>Even the betrayer plays his part. Every imagined desire must be released in faith, handed over, sometimes even doubted or dismissed. But this is the sacred betrayal. It moves the inner act toward its outer fulfilment.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>"For the Son of man goeth as it was determined..." (Luke 22:22)</blockquote>
<p>The Son of Man, symbolising the awakened state of being, moves forward according to what has already been imagined. Neville taught that the world is yourself pushed out, and your assumptions are always fulfilled. Once the assumption is made and internalised, the outcome is determined.</p>
<p>This is the mystical supper: the moment you choose what you will embody, eat of it through inner conviction, drink of it through emotional intensity, and release it to become flesh.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The Last Supper is not a memory, but a living process. Neville Goddard’s understanding invites us to take communion not with bread and wine, but with imagination and belief. To eat is to assume. To drink is to feel. To betray is to let go. And to rise again is to see your world change.</p>
<p>This is the sacred pattern of manifestation: assumption, acceptance, release, and resurrection. You are always invited to the table. The question is—what are you ready to partake of next?</p><div class="share-dropdown">
