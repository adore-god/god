<h1>Eternity in the Heart: Ecclesiastes 3:11</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p><strong>Ecclesiastes 3:11 (ESV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man’s heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>In Neville Goddard’s teaching, <strong>God is your own wonderful human imagination</strong>.  
This verse is not about an unknowable deity hiding information — it is explaining how creation works.</p>

<p><strong>“Eternity”</strong> does not mean endless time.  
It means <strong>completion</strong>.</p>

<p>The finished reality — the fulfilled version of every possible desire — is already placed <strong>within you</strong>, in imagination. The end exists first. Time only reveals it.</p>

<p>You are not meant to understand <em>how</em> things will happen.</p>

<p>That is why the verse says man cannot find out what God has done “from the beginning to the end.”  
The process is deliberately hidden from the reasoning mind.</p>

<p>If you could see the steps, you would try to manage them.  
Faith would be replaced with effort.</p>

<p>The law of assumption works differently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You assume the end state</li>
  <li>You feel it as real now</li>
  <li>The process unfolds automatically</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="elohim-god.html">conscious mind</a> is not designed to trace causes.  
It is designed to <strong>accept states</strong>.</p>

<p>This is why Neville emphasised living in the end.  
You do not study the plan — you <strong>enter</strong> the state. <a href="living-in-end-bible-passages-that.html">You can read more Bible passages regarding 'living from the end' here.</a></p>

<p>The verse is saying that creation is not logical, linear, or visible from the outside.  
It is psychological and experiential.</p>

<p>You move through states of consciousness, often without knowing what is changing until the result appears.</p>

<p>Just as a child does not know how its body grows, you do not know how assumptions harden into facts.</p>

<p>You are not required to know.</p>

<p>You are only required to <strong>assume</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The end already exists.</strong></p>

<p>It is hidden from analysis,  
but alive in imagination.</p>

<p>You do not uncover it by logic.</p>

<p>You realise it by accepting it as true.</p>

<p><strong>This is the law of assumption.</strong></p>
