<blockquote><p>"And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters."— Genesis 1:2
</p> <p> 
"And all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea." — 1 Corinthians 10:2</p></blockquote>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s interpretation of the Bible, every character personifies a psychological state or faculty within you — not a literal person in history. <a href="genesis-126-man.html">Moses and Aaron</a> are personified aspects of consciousness, working together to <strong>lift awareness and bring all faculties of mind into harmony</strong>, enabling your assumptions to be held and manifested in reality.</p><h3>Moses: Lifted Awareness of I AM</h3><p>Moses’ name, meaning “<i>drawn from the water</i>,” symbolises the inner faculty that <strong>raises latent potential into conscious awareness</strong>. By this stage, the mind has matured through prior faculties—<a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">faith (Abraham), imagination (Joseph), persistence (Jacob), and praise (Judah).</a> Moses represents the <strong>integration of these faculties into the recognition of I AM</strong>, initiating the assumptions that will shape your experience.</p><p><a href="scrolls/label-paul-series.html">Paul</a> and the Book of Acts reinforce Moses’ symbolic role. Throughout Acts, Moses is repeatedly referenced, particularly in Stephen’s speech (Acts 7), emphasising the enduring principle he represents: the <strong>inner recognition of I AM applied in consciousness</strong>. Acts 7:22 notes that</p><p></p><blockquote>Moses “was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.” </blockquote><p></p><p>This highlights the mind’s <strong>capacity for knowing and speaking truth</strong>, a faculty fully present in Moses.</p><h3>Aaron: The External Priestly Expression</h3><p>Aaron, associated with “light” or “exalted,” embodies the <strong>faculty that expresses and enacts Moses’ lifted awareness</strong> outwardly. He brings the many inner voices — the <strong>Elohim</strong> — into harmony, allowing the inner recognition of I AM to be <strong>communicated, demonstrated, and applied</strong>.</p><p>Exodus 4:15–16 shows Moses initially hesitant to speak, with God instructing him: “You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth.” Psychologically, this illustrates that <strong>even the inner awareness of I AM must be transmitted through the appropriate external faculty</strong>. Moses knows and can “speak,” but Aaron, the priestly expression, <strong>channels and stabilises that awareness outwardly</strong> so it can be properly received and enacted.</p><p>As Acts 15:21 notes, </p><p></p><blockquote>‘For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.’ — Acts 15:21</blockquote><p></p><p>Psychologically, this shows that the awareness Moses embodies — the recognition of <a href="elohim-god.html">I AM — is continually preserved and communicated across all faculties of consciousness</a>, sustained by the external priestly faculty and the aligned Elohim.”. The Sabbath refers to the initial <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">seven days of creation when God rested in the I AM.</a></p><p>Aaron’s priesthood also reflects <strong>cleaving</strong> (Genesis 2:24): <a href="genesis-224-love.html">leaving old assumptions behind and joining all parts of consciousness to the lifted awareness of Moses</a>. The later <a href="levi-levites-aaron-and-jesus-symbolism.html">distribution of Levites throughout Israel</a> symbolises the <strong>spread of aligned faculties</strong>, sustaining conscious application across all areas of mind.</p><h3>When Moses Puts Words in Aaron’s Mouth</h3><p>Aaron embodies the <strong>faculty that dwells in and conveys the assumed state</strong>, allowing the inner recognition of I AM to manifest in the world.</p><h3>The Role of Elohim: The Many Inner Voices</h3><p>The Hebrew word <a href="elohim-god.html">Elohim</a>, meaning “the judges” or “rulers,” represents the collection of inner faculties, judgments, and assumptions. Moses lifts consciousness into recognition of the creative principle, and Aaron brings all voices into <strong>coherent alignment</strong>, enabling the mind to act as one unified creative source.</p><h3>Aaron’s Sacred Garments: The Attitudes You Wear</h3><p>Aaron’s priestly garments (Exodus 28) symbolise <strong>the feeling, conviction, and mental attitude</strong> required to dwell in the assumed state. They represent how consciousness <strong>wears the feeling of fulfillment</strong>, allowing inner assumption to be expressed outwardly through thought, speech, and action.</p><h3>The Golden Calf: Turning Away from Alignment</h3><p>When Aaron yields to the people’s request to build the golden calf (Exodus 32), it symbolises <strong>diverting attention from the inner assumed state to external appearances and doubt</strong>. Even faculties that integrate consciousness must remain centred in feeling, otherwise manifestation falters.</p><h3>Aaron’s Budding Rod: Evidence of Dwelling in the Assumed State</h3><p>Aaron’s rod that budded (Numbers 17) demonstrates the natural manifestation that follows <strong>faithful dwelling in the assumed state</strong>. Just as a rod that appears dead brings forth buds, the inner conviction of a fully embodied assumption produces evidence in the world.</p><h3>Moses and Aaron as One Creative Process</h3><p>Moses lifts consciousness into <strong>the recognition of I AM</strong>, and Aaron brings all faculties into harmony so the assumed state can <strong>be fully felt and embodied</strong>. Their priesthood embodies <strong>cleaving</strong>—leaving old assumptions behind and joining all parts of mind to the central awareness.</p><p>Paul’s letters and Acts reinforce this psychological framework: the shift from <strong>law to spirit</strong> mirrors the movement from external ritual (Moses as lawgiver) to <strong>inner conviction and dwelling in the assumed state</strong> (Aaron as priest). Moses’ hesitancy to speak through Aaron shows the <strong>necessity of harmonious expression</strong>, not inferiority: inner awareness must align with the external faculty for manifestation to occur. Together, Moses and Aaron illustrate the <strong>Law of Assumption in practice</strong>: consciousness must not only <strong>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>, but also <strong>dwell in it and embody it through all faculties</strong>, allowing the unseen to manifest in form.</p>
