</blockquote>

<p>
In Neville Goddard’s psychological reading of Scripture, biblical figures do not record religious history.
They personify <strong>functions of consciousness</strong> operating within the individual.
Moses and Aaron together describe the <strong>priestly mechanism of the mind</strong> — not morality, ritual, or leadership,
but how awareness relates to itself and stabilises an assumed identity.
</p>

<p>
Read alongside <a class="noTag" href="el/romans-3-psychological-meaning.html">Romans 3</a>, <a href="the-damascus-turning-from-sauls-old.html">Saul’s conversion in Acts</a>, and the <a class="noTag" href="el/jesus-high-priest-new-covenant.html">priesthood described in Hebrews 7–9</a>,
Moses and Aaron reveal why early consciousness required mediation — and why that mediation later collapses.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>Moses: Awareness Lifted Out of the Waters</h2>

<p>
Moses’ name means <em>“drawn from the water”</em>.
Water, throughout Scripture, symbolises the undifferentiated mental field — thoughts, emotions, memories,
and reactive patterns.
</p>

<p>
Moses therefore represents the faculty that <strong>lifts awareness out of unconscious identification</strong>
and brings it into recognition of <em>I AM</em>.
</p>

<p>
By the time Moses appears, consciousness has already developed its <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">core faculties:
faith (Abraham), persistence (Jacob), imagination (Joseph), and praise or valuation (Judah)</a>.
Moses is not a new faculty but an <strong>integration point</strong> — the moment the mind recognises
the source from which these faculties operate.
</p>

<p>
This is why Paul can say that Israel was “baptised into Moses.”
Psychologically, the mind is immersed into a new identity — awareness anchored in <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html"><em>I AM</em></a> 
rather than in appearances.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>Moses and Speech: Knowing Without Dwelling</h2>

<p>
Exodus presents Moses as reluctant to speak.
This is not a flaw.
It describes a psychological truth:
<strong>recognition of I AM does not automatically stabilise identity</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Awareness may awaken, yet the mind may still lack the capacity to remain, feel, and express that awareness
consistently.
This gap necessitates priesthood.
</p>

<p>
Acts 7 emphasises that Moses was “powerful in speech and action,” not because of eloquence,
but because consciousness now knows the creative principle.
Yet knowing alone is insufficient.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>Aaron: Priesthood as Stabilisation of Identity</h2>

<p>
Aaron does not represent public ministry or external religion.
He represents the <strong>inner priestly function</strong> — the faculty that
<strong>dwells in, feels, and sustains the assumed state</strong>.
</p>

<p>
In psychological terms:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Moses recognises <em>I AM</em></li>
<li>Aaron remains in it</li>
</ul>

<p>
This mirrors the pattern later clarified in Hebrews:
early consciousness cannot yet abide permanently in awareness.
It approaches indirectly, through mediation.
</p>

<p>
When God says to Moses, “You shall put the words in his mouth,” the meaning is precise.
Awareness initiates identity, but priesthood <strong>keeps the mind from drifting back into judgement</strong>.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>The Priestly Function and Elohim</h2>

<p>
Elohim — translated as “judges” or “rulers” — represents <a href="elohim-god.html">the many inner evaluations,
assumptions, and voices within the psyche</a>.
</p>

<p>
Priesthood is required when these inner voices are fragmented.
Aaron’s function is to <strong>bring coherence</strong> — aligning thought, feeling,
and self-concept around the recognition Moses introduces.
</p>

<p>
Acts 15:21 notes that Moses is proclaimed continually.
Psychologically, this means the principle of <em>I AM</em>
must be repeatedly stabilised until it becomes natural.
</p>

<p>
Sabbath does not indicate a day, but the mental rest that occurs when
awareness no longer argues with itself.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>Aaron’s Garments: Feeling as Identity</h2>

<p>
The priestly garments described in Exodus are not ritual decoration.
They symbolise the <strong>mental and emotional attitude worn by consciousness</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Neville’s language is exact here:
feeling is not emotion, but <strong>the sense of being</strong>.
The garments represent the mind clothed in the feeling of fulfilment.
</p>

<p>
Without this feeling, recognition remains abstract.
With it, assumption becomes embodied.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>The Golden Calf: Regression to External Validation</h2>

<p>
The golden calf episode does not indict Aaron as weak.
It illustrates a universal psychological regression:
turning away from inner assumption toward visible proof.
</p>

<p>
When attention shifts back to appearances,
priesthood collapses into idolatry — consciousness once again
seeks reassurance outside itself.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>Aaron’s Budding Rod: The Tree of Life in Operation</h2>

<p>
Aaron’s rod that buds is not a miracle performed to prove authority. 
It is the same psychological principle seen earlier in <a href="the-striped-rods-of-jacob-study-in.html">Jacob’s grafted sticks</a>. 
A dead-looking branch placed in the right environment produces life naturally.
</p>

<p>
The rod symbolises a <strong>state assumed</strong>. 
When identity is grafted into the living root of awareness — the <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html"><em>Tree of Life</em></a> — 
expression follows without effort, struggle, or repetition.
</p>

<p>
<a href="the-striped-rods-of-jacob-study-in.html">Jacob’s rods were set before the flock, not to force growth, but to establish a pattern of seeing</a>. 
Likewise, Aaron’s rod buds because consciousness is no longer divided. 
The mind is no longer oscillating between belief and doubt.
</p>

<p>
What appears lifeless is not lacking power. 
It is disconnected from its source. 
Once grafted into the felt assumption of being, life flows automatically.
</p>

<p>
The budding rod therefore represents <strong>natural evidence</strong>, not reward.
Not proof demanded by authority, but confirmation that identity has taken root.
This is the Tree of Life functioning psychologically — awareness expressing itself through form.
</p>


<p>
This is not reward.
It is inevitability.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>Moses and Aaron as a Transitional Priesthood</h2>

<p>
Together, Moses and Aaron describe an <strong>early stage of conscious development</strong>.
Awareness has awakened but still requires mediation to remain stable.
</p>

<p>
This is why Hebrews later declares the priesthood obsolete.
Once consciousness can abide directly in <em>I AM</em>,
mediation is no longer necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a href="the-damascus-turning-from-sauls-old.html">Saul’s collapse into Paul</a>,
<a class="noTag" href="el/romans-3-psychological-meaning.html">Romans 3’s end of self-prosecution</a>,
and <a class="noTag" href="el/jesus-high-priest-new-covenant.html">Christ’s entrance into the holy place</a>
all describe the same movement:
priesthood dissolves when identity becomes permanent.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>The Law of Assumption in Operation</h2>

<p>
Moses initiates recognition.
Aaron stabilises identity.
Together they enact the Law of Assumption before it is fully internalised.
</p>

<p>
Consciousness must first <strong>know</strong> who it is,
then <strong>remain</strong> there,
before priesthood disappears altogether.
</p>

<p>
This is not theology.
It is the psychology of awakening.
