<p>In Neville Goddard’s interpretation of the Bible, every character represents a psychological state or faculty within you — not a literal person in history. Moses and Aaron are two symbolic aspects of your own mind, working together to shape and express your assumptions, which then create your reality.</p>
<h2>Moses: The Creative Power of Imagination</h2>
<p>Moses symbolises your imagination — the creative screen of space that conceives your desires. It is in imagination that all things begin. As Neville teaches, “Imagining creates reality,” and Moses represents that inner movement where you dare to assume a new state.</p>
<h2>Aaron: The Expression and Outward Assumption</h2>
<p>Aaron, as Moses’ brother and spokesman, symbolises your spoken word and outer expression — the bridge between the imaginal act and its physical appearance. According to Neville, your words reflect and reinforce your inner assumptions.</p>
<p>When Moses (imagination) “puts words” into Aaron’s mouth (Exodus 4:15-16), this illustrates that your imagination must first impress itself deeply before it can be spoken or outwardly affirmed. Speech without inner conviction is empty; it is the assumption behind the words that gives them power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.”</em> — Proverbs 18:21</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Role of Elohim: The Inner Judges and Rulers</h2>
<p>The Hebrew word <a href="elohim-god.html">Elohim, often translated "God," means “the judges” or “rulers.”</a> Neville interprets this as the inner collection of assumptions, beliefs, and mental rulers that shape your self-perception and thus your world.</p>
<p>Moses (imagination) creates the assumption. Aaron (expression) speaks it. Together, they work to guide the “Elohim” — the many judgments and inner voices — into agreement with your chosen state. This is how you form a clear self-concept, which is then expressed outwardly as your life experience.</p>
<h2>Aaron’s Sacred Garments: The Attitude You Wear</h2>
<p>Aaron’s priestly <a href="the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">garments</a> (Exodus 28) symbolise the mental states and attitudes you must "put on" to match your desired assumption. Neville would call these your feelings of naturalness — the emotional conviction that your desire is already true.</p>
<h2>The Golden Calf: Warning Against Doubt</h2>
<p>When Aaron yields to the people's request to build the golden calf (Exodus 32), it symbolises turning your attention to external appearances and doubts, instead of remaining faithful to your inner assumption. Neville warns never to worship "graven images" — meaning external facts — but to persist in the unseen imaginal act.</p>
<h2>Aaron’s Budding Rod: The Evidence of Faith</h2>
<p>Aaron’s rod that budded (Numbers 17) symbolises the natural manifestation that follows a sustained assumption. Just as a rod that appears dead brings forth buds, your outer world will blossom when your assumption is held with faith and persistency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”</em> — Mark 11:24</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Moses and Aaron as One Creative Process</h2>
<p>Ultimately, Moses and Aaron work as one: imagination (Moses) conceives, and expression (Aaron) affirms and externalises. They illustrate how you must assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled inwardly, and then reinforce it outwardly through speech, actions, and self-talk — the true Law of Assumption in practice.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Moses and Aaron are not ancient figures but living symbols within you. Together, they teach you that you are Elohim — the inner judge and creator of your world. By mastering imagination and expression as one harmonious process, you shape your assumptions into visible reality.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-moses-series.html" class="noTag">Moses Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-object-symbolism.html" class="noTag">Object Symbolism</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-priesthood-series.html" class="noTag">Priesthood Series</a></p>
