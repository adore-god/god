<h1>Birds in the Expanse of the Heavens</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p></p><p>From the very <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">beginning of Scripture</a>, birds appear as divine announcements from heaven, signaling movements of spirit and imagination. </p><blockquote>"And let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.” - Genesis 1:20</blockquote><p></p><p>In Genesis, the <a href="elohim-god.html">Spirit of God</a> is described as “hovering over the face of the waters” (Genesis 1:2), a hovering like a bird announcing creation’s dawn. Similarly, in the New Testament, at the baptism of Jesus, a dove descends from heaven, revealing the presence of the Spirit resting upon the <a href="creating-with-scripture-word-of-god-and.html">fulfilled Word</a> (Acts 10:38; Matthew 3:16).</p><p>In the symbolic world of Scripture, birds are never just birds. They are movements of spirit, flights of the imagination, messengers that reflect the inner condition of consciousness. They are symbols in the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man's language of imagination</a>.</p><p>Two birds stand out in the biblical narrative: the dove released from Noah’s ark and the dove that descends upon Jesus at His baptism. Understood through the teachings of Neville Goddard, these birds reveal a deeper truth—the journey of imagination itself, from chaos to creative rest.</p><p><strong>The Raven: Wandering Thought Without Rest</strong></p><p>
After the flood, Noah sends out a raven.<br/>
It flies to and fro, never returning.</p><p>The raven represents unfocused thought, imagination still bound to the outer world. It symbolises unrest, circling the ruins of former beliefs, unable to land because it finds no new state ready to receive it.</p><p>In Neville’s terms, this is the imagination reacting to the world, rather than creating it.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Man is all imagination, and God is man, and exists in us and we in Him.”<br/>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>The Dove: Spirit Searching for Fulfilment</strong><br/>
Then Noah sends out a dove.<br/>
But, “she found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned” (Genesis 8:9).</p><p>This is imagination beginning to separate from the old state—the ark—but not yet fully formed in the new. It is the self gently reaching for a higher assumption, testing the waters of the subconscious.</p><p>On her second journey, the dove returns with an olive leaf—a sign of peace and renewal, but more deeply, a sign of evidence.<br/>
The imagined state is beginning to produce fruit.</p><blockquote>
<p>“An assumption, though false, if persisted in, will harden into fact.”<br/>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>On the third release, the dove does not return.<br/>
She has found rest. The assumption is now embodied.</p><p>Imagination has left the ark of uncertainty and made its home in the fulfilled state.</p><p><strong>The Dove at the Jordan: Resting Upon the Fulfilled Word</strong><br/>
At Jesus’s baptism, another dove appears:</p><blockquote>
<p>“And he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him.”<br/>
— Matthew 3:16</p>
</blockquote><p>This is not a bird in search of rest—it finds rest.<br/>
Here, the dove is not returning to the ark. It is descending upon the state of full assumption. Jesus, as the symbolic embodiment of fulfilled imagination, is the Word made flesh.</p><p>The creative spirit rests because the condition is right.</p><p><strong>The Bird as Imaginative Activity</strong><br/>
The bird in both stories is the imagination in movement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The raven is scattered thought—unrest, reaction, wandering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first dove is the reaching spirit—hopeful but unanchored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second dove brings back proof—partial manifestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third dove finds rest—the state assumed and fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dove at the Jordan descends upon rest—creative power dwelling in stability.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“You must enter into the image of your desire and remain there.”<br/>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>From Flight to Fulfilment</strong><br/>
These doves teach us the nature of spiritual movement:<br/>
The Spirit will not rest where belief has not taken root.<br/>
Imagination, like the bird, will return if the waters are not yet still.</p><blockquote>
<p>"And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters."</p>
</blockquote><p>But once you assume the state—once you feel the wish fulfilled and abide there—the bird will no longer circle. It will stay.<br/>
It will descend.</p><p>And when the dove remains, so too does the manifestation.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
