<p>In <a href="only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard’s</a> teaching, “<a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-exodus-3-14--i-am.html">I AM</a>” is not just a phrase — it is the <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-names-and-genealogies-series.html">NAME</a> OF <a href="elohim-god.html">GOD</a>, the key to <a href="elohim-god.html">conscious</a> creation, and the foundation of the Law of Assumption. It is the operating power of awareness and self-perception, the cause of all that appears in your world.</p>

<p><a href="el/bible-kingdom-structure.html">The Bible is written as a kingdom</a>. Every kingdom has a Lord, judges, rulers, laws, and authority. Scripture repeatedly calls God <b>Judge</b>, <b>Ruler</b>, and <b>King</b> — not to describe domination, but governance. In biblical psychology, authority means <b>the right to judge</b>, and judgement means <b>the power to define what something is</b>. The Kingdom of God is within you, and its authority operates upon one thing alone: <b>I AM</b>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I AM is the self-definition of the absolute.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>

<h2>Genesis 1:26 — Man in God's Image</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness…" — <em>Genesis 1:26</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neville taught that “<a href="elohim-god.html">God</a>” in this verse is Elohim — a plural name representing the judges and rulers of consciousness, the manifold powers of imagination. <a href="genesis-126-man.html">Man is made in the image of God</a> — not as flesh, but as identity shaped by judgement. In other words, the states you accept as true of <b>I AM</b> are the very “man” you experience yourself to be.</p>

<p>To be made in God’s image is to be endowed with authority — the power of self-definition. Man is not created as a subject within the kingdom, but as the product of its inner government. Consciousness does not obey circumstance; circumstance obeys the judgements placed upon <b>I AM</b>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Exodus 3:14 — The Name of God Is “I AM”</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"<b>I AM</b> THAT <b>I AM</b>." — <em>Exodus 3:14 (KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Moses asks for <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">God’s name</a>, he is not given a title, but a declaration of authority. <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-exodus-3-14--i-am.html">I AM</a> is the seat of judgement. It is not external. It is the point within the reader from which all meaning is assigned.</p>

<p>God is called <b>Judges</b> and <b>Rulers</b> of <b>I AM THAT I AM</b> because awareness governs identity. Authority is not placed on events, people, or conditions — it is placed on what you consent to be true of yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I AM is the only name of God.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Hebrew, <em>Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh</em> means “<b>I will be what I will be</b>.” The verb <em>hayah</em> (הָיָה) means to exist, to become. This is not prophecy — it is jurisdiction. What I judge myself to be, I must become. This is explored further here: <a href="el/yhvh-ehyeh-linguistic-framework.html">YHVH and Ehyeh — The Linguistic Engine of Transformation</a></p>

<p>The repetition “<b>I AM THAT I AM</b>” reveals <b><a href="the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">the Law of Identical Harvest</a></b>. Identity returns itself. The judgement placed upon I AM is the law under which experience unfolds.</p>

<p>Neville understood this as the revelation of your eternal identity — not a distant deity, but the governing awareness within your own inner kingdom.</p>
<hr>

<h3>The Law of Assumption: Identity Precedes Experience</h3>
<p>The Law of Assumption is the lawful operation of judgement within consciousness. To assume is to rule. To persist in an assumption is to legislate.</p>

<p>You must <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</a> — not as effort, but as identity. Experience does not change first. Authority does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. That assumption, though false, if persisted in, will harden into fact.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“I AM healthy” is not affirmation — it is judgement. You are deciding what law governs your body. The kingdom responds accordingly.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Solomon’s Temple: A Symbol of Inner Structure</h3>
<p><a href="building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html">Solomon’s Temple</a> symbolises the ordered structure of consciousness — a kingdom arranged by authority.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Holy of Holies is I AM — the seat of judgement.</p></li>
<li><p>The outer courts are states — conditions entered by assumption.</p></li>
<li><p>To “<a href="the-symbolism-of-tents-cities-and.html">build the temple</a>” is to establish disciplined authority over thought and feeling.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Bible is a psychological drama. The characters represent states of consciousness.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>

<h3>The Triune Nature of Man: Spirit, Soul, and Body</h3>
<p>Neville linked “I AM” with the triune structure of authority:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Spirit (I AM | Ask):</strong> The presiding awareness — the Lord.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soul (Imagination | Believe):</strong> The judicial chamber where states are assumed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Body (Manifestation | Receive):</strong> The visible decree of inner judgement.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I AM unifies the process. What is judged internally becomes law externally.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Jesus’ “I AM” Sayings: Consciousness in Action</h3>
<p><a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Jesus</a> represents imagination awakened to authority. His “I AM” statements are not theology — they are rulings.</p>

<ul>
<li>“I AM the light of the world”</li>
<li>“I AM the bread of life”</li>
<li>“I AM the way”</li>
<li>“I AM the resurrection”</li>
<li>“Before Abraham was, I AM”</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesus speaks as Lord — not reacting to conditions, but defining them.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Jesus’ “I AM” Statements and the Divine Identity</h3>
<p>The Trinity symbolises the lawful flow of authority:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Father — I AM:</strong> Authority itself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Son — Assumed Identity:</strong> Authority exercised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spirit — Manifestation:</strong> Authority expressed.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Resurrection: The Awakening to “I AM”</h3>
<p>Resurrection is the moment authority is reclaimed. Identity is no longer judged by circumstance but by consciousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The resurrection is when man discovers he is God.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>

<h3>The Practice: Living From “I AM”</h3>
<p>You are always ruling — either unconsciously or deliberately. Salvation occurs when authority is removed from old judges and placed back on I AM.</p>

<ul>
<li>“I AM chosen”</li>
<li>“I AM peaceful”</li>
<li>“I AM already it”</li>
<li>“I AM the one I want to be”</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not affirmations. They are judgements.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Conclusion: “I AM” as the Divine Formula</h3>
<p>The Bible is a kingdom manual. Authority governs identity. Identity governs experience. When you understand I AM, you understand God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You are <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a>, if you would only believe it.” — Neville Goddard</p>
<p>“God is Imagination—the creative power within us all.”</p>
