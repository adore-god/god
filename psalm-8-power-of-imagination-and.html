<h1>Psalm 8: A Little Lower Than The Stars</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p style="text-align: left;">Psalm 8 is often read as a hymn of praise to God's majesty in creation, yet when viewed through Neville Goddard’s teachings, it reveals a profound spiritual pattern of our true creative identity. By connecting these verses to Genesis 1:26, we see that <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> is not l a passive observer but an imagining creator, crowned with the power of imagination. This psalm invites us to rediscover our dominion and realise that the “I AM” within is the very force shaping our world.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Psalm 8:1</strong><br/>
"O <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a> our Lord, how great is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory far above the heavens."</p>
</blockquote><p>This verse acknowledges God’s greatness, which Neville interpreted as the creative consciousness within us. “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">Your name” refers to “I AM”</a>—the source of all creation. When aligned with this “I AM,” we claim our divine power to shape reality.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 8:2</strong><br/>
"You have made clear your strength even out of the mouths of babies at the breast, because of those who are against you; so that you may put to shame the cruel and violent man."</p>
</blockquote><p>The “<a href="label-child-like-faith.html">mouth of babies” represents pure, undoubting imagination</a>. Approaching desires with this simplicity gives strength to silence inner doubts—the “avenger” or critical voice. Strength arises when we return to childlike faith.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 8:3</strong><br/>
"When I see your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have ordered,"</p>
</blockquote><p>The heavens symbolise limitless possibilities. The moon and stars reflect the ordered power of imagination, through which we create. Your imagination is vast and precise, just like the cosmos.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 8:4</strong><br/>
"What is man, that you should keep him in mind? And the son of man, that you should give attention to him?"</p>
</blockquote><p>This verse invites awe at the focus God places on human consciousness. In <em>Genesis 1:26</em>, God makes <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man in His image</a>—imagination—giving him dominion. “Man” and “son of man” represent your imaginative self, which is the true creative power within.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 8:5</strong><br/>
"For you have made him a little lower than the angels, and have crowned him with glory and honour."</p>
</blockquote><p>Echoing <em>Genesis 1:26</em>, this verse reveals that, though we live in form, we possess divine likeness and dominion. The “crown” symbolises your authority as a creator through imagination—the “glory and honour” are your birthright when you assume this power.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 8:6</strong><br/>
"You make him ruler over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet:"</p>
</blockquote><p>You are not subject to conditions; they are subject to you. All is “under your feet” when you realise everything springs from consciousness. Neville teaches that what you accept inwardly becomes outward reality.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 8:7</strong><br/>
"All sheep and oxen, and the beasts of the field;"</p>
</blockquote><p>This directly recalls <em>Genesis 1</em>, where <a href="the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">man is given dominion over all creatures</a>. Symbolically, these represent conditions, emotional states, and manifested outcomes—all creations of imagination that you are meant to direct.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 8:8</strong><br/>
"The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas."</p>
</blockquote><p>Again reflecting <em>Genesis 1</em>, these symbolise the endless range of thoughts, possibilities, and subconscious impressions moving within you. Just as man was given rule over every creature, so too you have dominion over every state within you.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 8:9</strong><br/>
"O Lord our Lord, how great is your name in all the earth!"</p>
</blockquote><p>Repeating the opening, this final verse affirms the power of the “I AM” within. By recognising this divine name as your own creative essence, you reclaim your ability to manifest consciously.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
</p><p>Psalm 8 is more than praise; it is a hidden blueprint for understanding your role as the imaginative power in creation. Together with <em>Genesis 1:26</em>, it affirms your dominion: you are crowned to shape reality from within. By knowing your consciousness is the birthplace of all experience, you realise you are not separate from God, but one with the creative force that spoke all into being—and now speaks through you.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-genesis-1-26-series.html">Genesis 1:26 Series</a> | <a href="label-psalms-series.html">Psalms Series</a></p>
