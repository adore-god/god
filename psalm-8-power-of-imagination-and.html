<h1>Psalm 8: A Little Lower Than The Stars</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Psalm 8 is traditionally ascribed to David: “To the <a href="to-choir-master-what-it-really-means-in.html">chief musician</a> upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.” Seen through Neville’s teachings, David represents the <strong>ideal self</strong>, and the one he addresses is the<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html"> <strong>I AM</strong> — the creative consciousness within</a>. The psalm opens and closes with recognition of this inner source, showing that though <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> may appear “a little lower than the stars,” he is in truth crowned with imagination and possesses dominion over all states of consciousness.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p>“O Lord, our Lord, how great is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.”<br/>
<em>Psalm 8:1</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">“name” is I AM, the source of all creation</a>. David, <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">the ideal self, recognises that the glory of imagination precedes all apparent order</a>. The heavens are not external powers above him; they represent the outer manifestation of thought, all of which are shaped by the I AM within.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p>“Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have ordained strength, because of your enemies, that you might still the enemy and the avenger.”<br/>
<em>Psalm 8:2</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The <a href="scrolls/label-child-like-faith.html">“mouth of babes” symbolises pure, undoubting imagination</a>. When the ideal self approaches creation with simplicity, critical or resisting voices — the “enemy and avenger” — are silenced. Strength arises naturally when imagination is expressed without doubt or fear.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p>“When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have ordained…”<br/>
<em>Psalm 8:3</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">stars, moon, and heavens represent fixed states of consciousness — outer patterns of thought</a>. David sees that these states are the “work of the fingers” of imagination. Consciousness, not some external deity, is the origin of this order. The ideal self recognises its role as co-creator of these patterns.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p>“What is man, that you are mindful of him? And the son of man, that you visit him?”<br/>
<em>Psalm 8:4</em></p>
</blockquote><p><a href="genesis-126-man.html">“Man” and “son of man” are states of self-awareness</a>, not biological labels. God’s mindfulness is the I AM activating itself through the ideal self. The ideal self marvels at the awareness it has been given — the capacity to direct and shape consciousness.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p>“For you have made him a little lower than the angels, and crowned him with glory and honour.”<br/>
<em>Psalm 8:5</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Though the stars and angels — representing higher or fixed states of consciousness — may seem above the ideal self, he recognises that <strong>imagination crowns him with creative dominion</strong>. This crown is the authority to assume states and bring them into being. The glory and honour are the birthright of every awakened self who recognises the I AM within as their source.</p><p>This also echoes Genesis 4:4–7, where <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">alignment with imagination is praised</a>: “If you do well, will you not be accepted?” Honour and dominion are inherent, arising naturally when the ideal self assumes the imagined state.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p>“You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet.”<br/>
<em>Psalm 8:6</em></p>
</blockquote><p>All <a href="elohim-god.html">states of consciousness — conditions, impressions, and possibilities — are under the direction of imagination</a>. The ideal self is not subject to circumstances; they are subject to the assumed state of being. Dominion is realised the moment one aligns with the I AM within.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p>“All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field; the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.”<br/>
<em>Psalm 8:7–8</em></p>
</blockquote><p>These creatures symbolise the raw elements of consciousness: conditions, emotional states, and manifested outcomes. All are under the crown of the ideal self — the directing power of imagination — and respond to the alignment of consciousness with the I AM.</p><hr/><blockquote>
<p>“O Lord our Lord, how great is your name in all the earth!”<br/>
<em>Psalm 8:9</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The psalm closes as it began: with recognition of the I AM. The ideal self sees that glory and dominion are internal realities, not external rewards. All creation is the expression of the imagined state, and the awakened self is its crown.</p><hr/><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Psalm 8 begins and ends with the same recognition: the I AM within. David, as the ideal self, speaks to this inner source and sees that all glory, honour, and dominion are inherent in imagination. Though man appears beneath the stars, he is in truth crowned with the power to assume and direct all states of consciousness. To recognise and dwell in this awareness is to take up the crown and rule consciously — the natural expression of every awakened self.</p>
