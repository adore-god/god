<h1>Jesus as the Ultimate State of Consciousness: Neville Goddard Style</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In Neville Goddard’s understanding of the Bible, the <strong>Old Testament</strong> is seen as an <strong>adumbration</strong> or <strong>foreshadowing</strong> of the <strong>New Testament</strong>. This means that the characters, events, and stories in the Old Testament are symbolic representations of the deeper spiritual truths revealed in the New Testament. For Neville, the Bible is a <strong>story of consciousness</strong>, with the Old Testament reflecting the journey of humanity in a more limited state of awareness, while the New Testament reveals the <strong>higher state of consciousness</strong> that leads to spiritual awakening and manifestation.</p><p>When comparing the <strong>state of consciousness</strong> of <strong>Jesus</strong> to that of the figures in the Old Testament, <strong>Jesus stands out</strong> as the embodiment of the <strong>highest level of consciousness</strong>—a <strong>perfect state of awareness</strong>. His life and teachings illustrate the <strong>ultimate realisation</strong> of the creative potential within human consciousness. In this article, we will explore how Neville would interpret <strong>Jesus as the highest state of consciousness</strong>, and what makes him stand out compared to the figures of the Old Testament.</p><hr><h3><strong>1. The Perfect Realisation of Imagination</strong></h3><p>In Neville Goddard’s view, <strong>Jesus embodies the creative power of imagination</strong> in its fullest form. In the Old Testament, figures like <strong>Moses</strong>, <strong>Abraham</strong>, and <strong>David</strong> serve as <strong>imperfect examples</strong> of the potential for spiritual transformation, yet they still struggle to fully understand and harness the power of imagination. They act as <strong>prototypes</strong> or <strong>symbols</strong> for what is to come.</p><p>However, <strong>Jesus represents the full manifestation</strong> of the principle that the <strong>Kingdom of Heaven is within us</strong>. He constantly emphasised the power of <strong>belief</strong> and <strong>imagination</strong>, teaching that <strong>faith</strong> and belief in the unseen are the keys to spiritual awakening and manifestation. Jesus exemplified the <strong>perfect state of imagination</strong>, knowing that the <strong>Father</strong> (the divine within) always hears him and answers his prayers. He demonstrated that <strong>imagination</strong> is not merely a mental exercise but the very <strong>creative force</strong> of the universe.</p><p>As <strong>Mark 11:24</strong> states:</p><blockquote><p>"Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."</p></blockquote><p>This perfectly aligns with Neville’s teaching that <strong>imagination, belief, and feeling</strong> are the forces that bring our desires into reality. Jesus’ consciousness represented the <strong>full realisation</strong> that what he believed, he created. This is the highest state of consciousness—realising the <strong>power of imagination and belief</strong> to shape the world around us.</p><hr><h3><strong>2. Jesus as the Embodiment of Divine Love</strong></h3><p>Another significant aspect of Jesus' consciousness is his embodiment of <strong>unconditional love</strong>. The Old Testament often presents love in a more conditional form, expressed through <strong>obedience to laws</strong> and <strong>rituals</strong>. While figures like <strong>Moses</strong> and <strong>David</strong> displayed great faith and love, their understanding was incomplete.</p><p>In the New Testament, however, <strong>Jesus transforms the concept of love</strong>, teaching that it is the <strong>greatest commandment</strong> and the key to spiritual fulfilment. As Neville interprets it, <strong>Jesus exemplifies the consciousness of love</strong> by teaching that we should love our neighbour as ourselves, forgive unconditionally, and focus on <strong>inner transformation</strong> rather than external circumstances.</p><p>In <strong>Matthew 22:37-39</strong>, Jesus says:</p><blockquote><p>"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself."</p></blockquote><p>For Neville, <strong>love</strong> is the highest expression of divine consciousness, because it is the <strong>foundation of all creation</strong>. Jesus’ state of consciousness reflected the <strong>purity of divine love</strong>, which enabled him to perform miracles, heal the sick, and teach others the path to spiritual awakening.</p><hr><h3><strong>3. Jesus and the Resurrection: The Awakening of Consciousness</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s interpretation, the <strong>resurrection of Jesus</strong> is not just a historical event, but rather a <strong>symbol of the awakening of consciousness</strong>. Jesus' rising from the dead represents the <strong>ultimate realisation of the true self</strong>—the <strong>Christ consciousness</strong>. This awakening to one’s divine nature is the culmination of the <strong>spiritual journey</strong> that the Old Testament figures were attempting to achieve, but could not fully realise.</p><p>In the Old Testament, figures like <strong>Moses</strong> and <strong>Elijah</strong> had glimpses of spiritual transformation, but they were not able to achieve the <strong>full realisation</strong> of their divine nature in the way that Jesus did. His resurrection symbolises the <strong>realisation of the Christ within</strong>, the <strong>highest state of consciousness</strong>. This is the state Neville teaches is available to all: the realisation that we are <strong>one with God</strong>, and that we have the creative power to manifest our desires.</p><p>In <strong>Romans 6:4</strong>, it says:</p><blockquote><p>"We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."</p></blockquote><p>In Neville’s teachings, <strong>living the new life</strong> refers to the <strong>awakening of our true nature</strong>. Like Jesus, we must realise our <strong>divine creative power</strong> through imagination and belief, which will bring about the transformation of our lives.</p><hr><h3><strong>4. Jesus and the Forgiveness of Sins: The Power of Inner Redemption</strong></h3><p>In the Old Testament, redemption was often linked to <strong>ritual sacrifice</strong>, and forgiveness was earned through acts of atonement. However, in the New Testament, Jesus reveals that forgiveness is not about external rituals but about an <strong>inner realisation</strong> of divine love and the <strong>forgiveness of others</strong>. This marks a <strong>higher state of consciousness</strong> because it involves the <strong>power of inner transformation</strong> rather than relying on external actions or circumstances.</p><p>In <strong>Matthew 18:21-22</strong>, Jesus teaches:</p><blockquote><p>"Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?' Jesus answered, 'I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.'"</p></blockquote><p>For Neville, <strong>forgiveness</strong> is about an <strong>internal state of consciousness</strong>. To forgive is to <strong>release old beliefs</strong>, <strong>resentments</strong>, and <strong>limitations</strong> that bind us to negative past experiences. By forgiving, we create the space for new and more positive manifestations to take place in our lives.</p><hr><h3><strong>5. Jesus as the Light of the World</strong></h3><p>Jesus is often referred to as the <strong>"Light of the World"</strong>. In Neville’s interpretation, this refers to the <strong>illumination of consciousness</strong>. Jesus embodies the <strong>inner light</strong> that leads us to self-realisation and the recognition of our creative potential. While figures in the Old Testament like <strong>Moses</strong> and <strong>Elijah</strong> had moments of spiritual illumination, Jesus is the <strong>ultimate expression</strong> of the <strong>light of divine consciousness</strong> that guides us to manifestation.</p><p>In <strong>John 8:12</strong>, Jesus says:</p><blockquote><p>“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</p></blockquote><p>For Neville, this <strong>light</strong> represents the <strong>awareness</strong> of the <strong>power of imagination and belief</strong> to create the reality we desire. Jesus’ state of consciousness is one where he <strong>fully realises</strong> that his inner light—his imagination and belief—has the power to shape the world around him. He teaches us to do the same.</p><hr><h3><strong>Conclusion: Jesus as the Ultimate State of Consciousness</strong></h3><p>In comparison to the figures of the Old Testament, <strong>Jesus stands out as the embodiment of the highest state of consciousness</strong>. He embodies the <strong>creative power of imagination</strong>, the <strong>purity of divine love</strong>, the <strong>resurrection to higher awareness</strong>, and the <strong>forgiveness</strong> that allows us to transcend old limitations and manifest a new reality.</p><p>While the Old Testament figures point toward the potential for spiritual growth and self-realisation, Jesus represents the <strong>ultimate realisation</strong> of these principles. He is the <strong>way, the truth, and the life</strong>—the perfect example of how the creative power of imagination, when fully realised, leads to <strong>spiritual transformation</strong> and <strong>manifestation</strong>.</p><p>In Neville’s terms, Jesus is the <strong>ideal state of consciousness</strong>, showing us that we, too, can rise to the same realisation of our own <strong>divine creative power</strong>.</p><p><br></p>
