<h1>Eutychus: The Boy Who Fell From the Window</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In Acts 20:8–12, we find a vivid scene—a young boy sitting in a window falls asleep and plunges to his death, only to be brought back to life through Paul’s conviction. While this might seem like a miracle, from Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption, it reveals a symbolic story of imagination, the momentary loss of assumption, and resurrection:</p><blockquote>
<p>“A certain young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in the window, sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. Overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third storey and was picked up dead. But Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. ‘Do not be alarmed,’ he said. ‘He is alive.’” (Acts 20:9–10)</p>
</blockquote><p>The boy’s name, Eutychus, means <strong>“fortunate” or “well-fated.”</strong> This represents the aspect of mind imagining good fortune that momentarily fell asleep—lost the feeling of the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">wish fulfilled</a>. Paul immediately strengthens the vision by assuming the reality of life and raising the boy, showing the power of living in the end.</p><hr/><h2>The Window as a Metaphor for Imagination</h2><p>The boy is described as sitting in a <strong>window</strong>, which, according to the <strong><a href="the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Mathers table of correspondences</a></strong>, is a symbol of imagination itself—the place where inner scenes are formed before they manifest outwardly.</p><p>Falling asleep in the window means losing the feeling of the fulfilled desire and identifying again with the evidence of the senses. This causes a fall from the state of assumption, appearing as death or failure.</p><hr/><h2>Paul and the Power of Assumption</h2><p>Paul represents the awakened imagination that knows the end is already accomplished. Without hesitation, he embraces the boy and declares, <em>“He is alive.”</em> This is the essence of the Law of Assumption—<strong>to assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled despite contrary appearances.</strong></p><p>Just as Neville taught, the spoken word and feeling combined in faith bring the imagined scene to life.</p><hr/><h2>Bread and Wine: Feeding the Assumption</h2><p>After the boy is revived, Paul <a href="feeding-5000-gospel-comparison.html">breaks bread</a> and eats, then continues speaking until dawn. In Neville’s terms, this breaking of bread is the act of <strong>feeding the assumption</strong>—revisiting the state of fulfilment and dwelling in the feeling of it.</p><p>Wine symbolises the joy and inner celebration of the fulfilled desire. Persisting in this state until dawn means remaining in the feeling of the end until it hardens into experience.</p><hr/><h2>Resurrection of the Assumed State</h2><p>“They brought the boy in alive, and were not a little comforted.” This story is a metaphor for the resurrection of any state of consciousness that has fallen asleep—any desire or identity that was abandoned but can be revived by <strong>living in the end</strong> and assuming its reality.</p><p>What fell from the window was not just a boy but a lost assumption. What rose again was the power to believe and feel the wish fulfilled.</p><p><strong>Assume the end. Live from it. And what seemed lost will be made real again.</strong></p><div class="share-dropdown">
