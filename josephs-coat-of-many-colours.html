<h1>Joseph's: Coat Of Many Colours</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In Genesis 37, <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph, an early teacher of the law of assumption</a>, demonstrates how the mind imaginatively assumes and how the principle—that what we assume to be true becomes our reality—operates in practice.</p>

<h3><strong>Joseph: The Embodiment of Emerging Consciousness</strong></h3>
<p><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph</a>, the son of Jacob and Rachel, represents a new aspect of the mind coming into awareness through the law of assumption. <a href="jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html">Jacob taught how to wrestle with and hold a brand-new identity</a>. As his youngest son, Joseph embodies the newest emerging form of that consciousness. The fact that he is loved above all his brothers is not about favouritism—it is the Bible presenting a choice to the reader, showing how to recognise, honour, and nurture the emergence of a new self.</p>

<p>The <strong>colourful <a href="the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">coat</a></strong> he wears is more than a garment—it symbolizes imagination in full expression. Each colour represents the many possibilities the mind can bring to life when actively assumed. Just as Joseph wears his coat visibly, <a href="the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">dressing the mind in imagination</a> allows inner vision to manifest in the outer world.</p>

<h3><strong>The Brothers’ Jealousy: Resistance to Imagination</strong></h3>
<p><a href="the-hatred-of-brothers-imagining.html">Joseph’s brothers, who envy him</a>, represent the rational or conditioned mind resisting the emergence of imagination. They resent the dreams and creative power Joseph embodies. This mirrors how our logical thoughts often feel threatened by bold, imaginative assumptions. Resistance may arise, but it only highlights the strength and inevitability of what is imagined.</p>

<h3><strong>Joseph’s Dreams: Imagination Shaping Reality</strong></h3>
<p>Joseph’s dreams of his <a href="joseph-dreamer-when-imagination-is.html">brothers’ sheaves bowing to his sheaf</a> symbolise imagination actively shaping reality. In Neville Goddard’s revelation, a dream is more than fantasy—it is the mind imagining. By imagining himself in a position of influence, Joseph demonstrates the law of assumption: <a href="genesis-111-seed.html"><strong>what you assume in your consciousness inevitably manifests in your life</strong></a>. Imagination is the blueprint; the external world is the reflection.</p>

<h3><strong>The Sale into Slavery: Temporary Suppression</strong></h3>
<p>When Joseph is sold into slavery, this represents the suppression of imagination by rational or external circumstances. Yet, as the story shows, imagination cannot be permanently restrained. Even when appearances suggest defeat, the law of assumption ensures that persistent belief in the imagined state will ultimately manifest. Challenges serve to test the firmness of your assumptions.</p>

<h3><strong>The Colourful Coat: Dressing the Mind</strong></h3>
<p>The coat of many colours embodies the active use of imagination. Just as one dresses the body, one must <a href="the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">“dress” the mind with imagination</a>, adorning it with vivid assumptions and bold expectations, like in <a href="eyes-of-fire-waist-of-gold-daniels.html">Daniel's visions of a man</a>. The coat reminds us that the mind can hold multiple creative possibilities simultaneously, and when embraced fully, these assumptions shape reality. Even when misrepresented or misunderstood, imagination retains its inherent power to manifest.</p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion: Living in Assumption</strong></h3>
<p>Genesis 37, read through Neville Goddard’s teachings, is a lesson in trusting imagination and assuming the reality you desire. Joseph’s story shows that imagination, though resisted or suppressed, is destined to rise. By “wearing the coat” of colourful assumptions and holding them vividly in consciousness, we align ourselves with the creative power within. <strong>Dress your mind with imagination, trust your assumptions, and watch your inner vision shape your outer world.</strong></p>
