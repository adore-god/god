<h1>Weaponised Scripture: 1 John 3:4–7</h1>
<p><i>The Bible: Psychological Simplicity, Not Religious Complexity</i></p><p>Before it was ever a religious text, the Bible was <strong>a psychological map</strong>.<br/>
Its stories, laws, and figures symbolise <strong>inner movements</strong>—shifts of consciousness, changes in assumption, and the invisible battles of the mind.<br/>
To read it literally is to miss the point.<br/>
To read it psychologically is to unlock its power.</p><p>The Bible is not a rulebook but a record of <strong>how your inner world creates your outer one.</strong><br/>
It deals not with external behaviours but with internal states—of faith, imagination, fear, and love.</p><hr/><h3><strong>When Scripture Is Misused</strong></h3><p>Few things cut deeper than weaponised scripture.<br/>
For centuries, verses like <strong>1 John 3:4–7</strong> have been quoted in spiritual warfare to shame, frighten, and control.<br/>
They’ve been twisted to suggest that sin is proof of unworthiness, that imperfection is damnable, and that righteousness is reserved for the few who appear flawless.</p><p>But the original message is nothing of the sort.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Sin, as the Bible Defines It: A Condition, Not a Curse</strong></h3><p>The Bible itself quietly defines sin in the earliest chapters.<br/>
Look to <strong>Genesis 4:7 (BBE)</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“If you do well, will you not be lifted up? and if you do not do well, sin is waiting at the door, desiring to get control over you: but you are to get the better of it.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Here, “if you do well” can be understood as <strong>imagining pleasurably</strong>—living from a place of positive, creative imagining. It is the call to align your inner world with joy and constructive faith.</p><p>In the story of Cain and Abel, this is the moment where Cain is invited to shift his imagination from jealousy and frustration to pleasure and faith.<br/>
He is told that if he imagines rightly, he will be “lifted up”—raised to a higher state of consciousness and fulfilment.</p><p>But “sin” here is the lurking condition—<strong>negative imagining</strong>—“waiting at the door,” ready to take control if he fails to “do well.”<br/>
This sin is not a moral stain but a <strong>lost opportunity</strong> to live from the creative power within.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Sin never meant moral failure.</strong><br/>
<strong>Sin never meant wickedness or a stain on the soul.</strong><br/>
<strong>Sin is simply missing the mark—failing to live in alignment with the truth of who you are.</strong></p>
</blockquote><hr/><h3><strong>What Is the Law Being Broken?</strong></h3><p><strong>1 John 3:4 (BBE)</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Everyone who is a sinner goes against the law, for sin is going against the law.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>But what is this law?<br/>
Not the law of commandments written in stone—but the <strong>Law of Consciousness</strong>.</p><p>Sin is not about breaking external rules.<br/>
It’s about <strong>turning away from the truth</strong> that your own wonderful human imagination is God.</p><p>Neville Goddard puts it clearly:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Sin is the refusal to imagine lovingly. It is the failure to live by faith in your own wonderful human imagination.”</em></p>
</blockquote><hr/><h3><strong>Jesus: The Living Law of Assumption in Action</strong></h3><p>When the Bible says Jesus “came to take away sin,” it’s not speaking of a historical figure arriving from outside.</p><p><strong>Jesus represents a state of awareness</strong>—the awakened consciousness that lives fully in the law of assumption.<br/>
This state is the inner recognition that <strong>your imagination is reality’s creative force</strong>.</p><p>To “be in Jesus” means to dwell in the fulfilled desire, to assume the end and live from that assumption.</p><p>Jesus is the embodiment of that powerful awareness—the <strong>living proof</strong> that sin (missing the mark) can be overcome by simply changing your inner state.</p><hr/><p><strong>1 John 3:5 (BBE)</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And you have knowledge that he came to take away sin: and in him there is no sin.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>He came—or better said, <strong>He is</strong>—the <strong>revelation of a sinless state</strong>.<br/>
In this awareness, there is no sin, because there is no misalignment.</p><p>To “abide in Him” means to live from the fulfilled desire.<br/>
It is not perfection—it is <strong>position</strong>.</p><hr/><p><strong>1 John 3:6 (BBE)</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Anyone who is in him does no sin; anyone who is a sinner has not seen him and has no knowledge of him.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>You do not see Him when you identify with lack, fear, or failure.<br/>
You see Him when you dwell in your assumed end.<br/>
When you live in the wish fulfilled, <strong>you are in Him</strong>—and in that state, you are not missing the mark.</p><hr/><p><strong>1 John 3:7 (BBE)</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>“My little children, let no man put you wrong: he who does righteousness is upright, even as he is upright.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To do righteousness is not to act perfectly.<br/>
It is to think and live from the state you choose to embody.<br/>
It is to <strong>feel the truth of your new identity</strong> so deeply that it becomes your reality.</p><p>Neville would say:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“You are already what you want to be, and your refusal to believe this is the only reason you do not see it.”</em></p>
</blockquote><hr/><h3><strong>You Are Not Condemned—You Are Called</strong></h3><p>This passage does not condemn—it awakens.<br/>
It doesn’t accuse you of being shameful.<br/>
It calls you to <strong>rise</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>You are righteous the moment you believe you are.</strong><br/>
<strong>You are sinless the moment you imagine rightly.</strong><br/>
<strong>You are redeemed not by blood, but by assumption.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>There is <strong>no wrath</strong> here.<br/>
Only awakening.<br/>
No threat.<br/>
Only invitation.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Sin has no hold on the one who knows who they are.</strong></p>
