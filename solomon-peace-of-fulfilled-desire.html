<h1>Solomon: The Peace of Fulfilled Desire</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Of all the figures in Scripture, Solomon stands as a luminous symbol of fulfilled desire, divine wisdom, and inner rest. Neville Goddard—whose teachings reveal the spiritual meanings veiled within biblical narrative—interprets Solomon not as a historical monarch, but as the personification of a spiritual state.</p><p><strong>Solomon represents what happens when imagination is faithfully and lovingly directed: desire gives birth to peace.</strong></p><p>Where <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David is longing—burning with faith and intensity</a>, Solomon is the realisation of that longing. He is what Neville might call <em>“the embodiment of the wish fulfilled”</em>—the result of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagining oneself into a state until it hardens into fact</a>. His very name, derived from <em>shalom</em>, means peace—not merely the absence of conflict, but the harmony born from union with one’s fulfilled assumption.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.”</strong><br>
— <em>1 Kings 2:12</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is not a statement about dynastic succession, but about consciousness. <strong>Solomon is the state of fulfilment that follows persistent faith.</strong> He is the result of having sat faithfully within the imagined end, allowing it to take the throne of awareness.</p><hr><h2><strong>The Temple of Fulfilled Awareness</strong></h2><p>One of Solomon’s defining achievements is the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. But for Neville, this Temple was never about stone and cedar.</p><p><strong>It is an inner structure—consciousness made sacred by deliberate assumption.</strong> This is the house we build for the name of the Lord, which is simply our “I AM”.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God…”</strong><br>
— <em>1 Kings 5:5</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The Temple’s ornamentation is deeply symbolic:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gold</strong> – spiritual value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cherubim</strong> – guardians of divine ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="the-hidden-power-of-tamar-how-palm.html">Palm trees</a></strong> – triumph over limitation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open flowers</strong> – consciousness blooming under the sun of inner conviction</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Solomon’s wisdom is not intellect—it is <strong>intuitive knowing</strong>. He asks not for power or vengeance, but for inner discernment:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart… that I may discern between good and bad.”</strong><br>
— <em>1 Kings 3:9</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To Neville, this is the wisdom to <strong>discern between states</strong>—between the fruitful and the barren, the true and the false.</p><p>Solomon’s famed judgment between the two women and the living child symbolises this very discernment. The true mother is <em>love</em>—the only power that breathes life into imagination. The false one is <em>fear, envy, or doubt</em>.</p><hr><h2><strong>The Song of Songs: The Union of Self and Fulfilment</strong></h2><p>Solomon is also linked to one of the most mysterious and poetic texts in Scripture—the <em>Song of Songs</em>. Traditionally seen as an allegory of divine love, Neville’s interpretation renders it more intimate:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>It is the soul’s romance with its fulfilled assumption.</strong></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>“I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine.”</strong><br>
— <em>Song of Solomon 6:3</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is not sentimental—it is metaphysical. This verse expresses <em>total identification</em> with the desired. The imagined state has become one’s identity.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.”</strong><br>
— <em>Song of Solomon 2:6</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This embrace is consciousness resting in fulfilment. <strong>It is the Sabbath</strong>—the moment striving ceases, and the soul knows it is complete.</p><hr><h2><strong>The Peace of Fulfilment</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>“And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree…”</strong><br>
— <em>1 Kings 4:25</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Solomon’s reign is marked by peace and plenty—not as a political reality, but as a <strong>state of consciousness aligned with truth</strong>. The vine and fig tree are symbols of spiritual fruitfulness. To dwell beneath them is to live <em>from</em> the fulfilled state—not merely to desire it.</p><p><strong>To walk in the state of Solomon is to live from completion, not towards it.</strong><br>
It is the end realised. The temple built. The wisdom known. The love consummated.</p><hr><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Living Temple</strong></h2><p>Solomon is not just a man remembered—<strong>he is a state entered</strong>. He is the fruit of faithful inner work, the reward of persistence in imagining, the glory of resting in what <em>is</em>.</p><p><strong>He is imagination crowned, love fulfilled, and peace enthroned.</strong></p><p>If David is the dreamer,<br>
<strong>Solomon is the dream made manifest.</strong><br>
And the <em>Song of Songs</em> is the echo of that union—<br>
<strong>the poetry of a soul in love with its fulfilled being.</strong></p>
