<h1>John: Jesus&rsquo; Appeal to the Father</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>John 17 is often read as a conversation between <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> and the Father, but Neville Goddard teaches that it actually describes an <b><a href="elohim-god.html">inner dialogue within a single consciousness</a></b>. In this framework, the &ldquo;Father&rdquo; is the deep I AM&mdash;the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">unconditioned awareness underlying all perception</a>&mdash;while references to &ldquo;disciples&rdquo; or &ldquo;believers&rdquo; symbolise the inner faculties of mind&mdash;imagination, memory, will, emotion, and intellect&mdash;<a href="twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">trained to accept the assumption</a>, &ldquo;the world&rdquo; represents the outer realm of appearances and attachments that contradict it. This chapter becomes a psychological map for<a href="genesis-224-love.html"> maintaining the fulfilled wish across every facet of the psyche, ensuring inner harmony despite external opposition</a>&nbsp;&mdash; Love.</p><hr/><h2>The Hour of Union</h2><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash;John 17:1</p>
</blockquote><p>&ldquo;Father&rdquo; addresses the deep <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>, the unconditioned awareness. &ldquo;Son&rdquo; represents the conscious self, the perceiving &ldquo;I.&rdquo; There is no pleading here, but a confident assertion: the inner conviction of unity has matured. This is the conscious mind affirming to the subconscious: the fulfilment is now. The &ldquo;glorify&rdquo; exchange is a mutual recognition of wholeness, experienced in the mind as inner certainty.</p><hr/><h2>Returning to the Original Glory</h2><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash;John 17:5</p>
</blockquote><p>The &ldquo;glory&rdquo; is not a future reward, but a return to the felt reality of oneness. Neville taught that all states are present&mdash;so this is a conscious descent into the state of unity. To say &ldquo;before the world began&rdquo; is to transcend appearances and identify with the eternal. It is a conscious claim: <em>I dwell in the end.</em></p><hr/><h2>The Inner Conflict Begins</h2><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash;John 17:14</p>
</blockquote><p><a href="elohim-god.html">&ldquo;Them&rdquo; refers to your mental faculties&mdash;imagination, intellect, will, emotion&mdash;that have accepted the new assumption</a>. &ldquo;The world&rdquo; is outer perception resisting inner change. Any time part of the psyche shifts, resistance arises. To say &ldquo;they are not of the world&rdquo; is to anchor those faculties in truth despite appearances.</p><hr/><h2>Not Escape&mdash;Preservation</h2><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash;John 17:15</p>
</blockquote><p>Ascension doesn&rsquo;t require fleeing the world&mdash;it demands <em>faithfulness in it</em>. &ldquo;Protect them&rdquo; means preserving each mental function from doubt. &ldquo;The evil one&rdquo; is any internal voice of fear, lack, or contradiction. Neville taught that when the inner state is stable, the outer has no power to shake it.</p><hr/><h2>Shielded by the Name</h2><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me&hellip; None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash;John 17:11&ndash;12</p>
</blockquote><p>&ldquo;Name&rdquo; means nature&mdash;awareness of being. The &ldquo;power of your name&rdquo; is the assumption itself. If a faculty (e.g. imagination) refuses to join in the assumption, it fragments the unity. This statement acknowledges that only what rejects the unity is &ldquo;lost.&rdquo; Everything else is preserved by the felt conviction of being.</p><hr/><h2>The Transfer Begins</h2><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I AM coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash;John 17:13</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, Jesus (the conscious &ldquo;I&rdquo;) announces a shift: <a href="genesis-224-love.html">from outer identification to inner wholeness</a>. &ldquo;Full measure of my joy&rdquo; signals that this isn&rsquo;t future happiness&mdash;it is joy as a <em>now-state</em>, a <a href="feeling-is-secret-unlocking-bliss.html">mood to be infused into every part of mind</a>. Neville calls this &ldquo;living from the end.&rdquo;</p><hr/><h2>Setting the Mind Apart</h2><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash;John 17:17</p>
</blockquote><p>To sanctify is to consecrate&mdash;to set apart each faculty to the one assumption. &ldquo;Your word is truth&rdquo; echoes like an anchor in the subconscious, dissolving contradictory beliefs. The conscious &ldquo;I&rdquo; repeats the truth until all of mind holds it. Neville described this as <em>watering the garden of the subconscious.</em></p><hr/><h2>One Mind, One Assumption</h2><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. I in them and you in me&mdash;so that they may be brought to complete unity.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash;John 17:21, 23</p>
</blockquote><p>&ldquo;All of them&rdquo; refers to the <a href="elohim-god.html">inner functions of mind</a>. Unity isn&rsquo;t abstract&mdash;it&rsquo;s psychological integrity. When imagination, will, memory, intellect, and emotion all reflect the same assumption, manifestation becomes inevitable. Neville called this the resonance of agreement: the subconscious and conscious reinforce each other in a loop of fulfilment.</p><hr/><h2>Where I AM&mdash;Bring Them Also</h2><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I AM, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash;John 17:24</p>
</blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those you have given me&rdquo; are the mental faculties again. &ldquo;Where I AM&rdquo; is a state of <a href="genesis-224-love.html">full awareness of union</a> with the deep I AM. This is not about a place&mdash;it&rsquo;s a level of consciousness. The goal is that imagination, memory, intellect, will, and emotion all dwell in this inner state, perceiving the &ldquo;glory&rdquo; of fulfilled being.</p><hr/><h2>Summary of Nevillean Psychology in John 17</h2><h3>The Father as the Deep I AM</h3><p>Each use of &ldquo;Father&rdquo; is a call to the subconscious&mdash;the foundation of reality. There is no duality; the dialogue is internal.</p><h3>Prayer as Assumption, Not Petition</h3><p>The statements are not requests but affirmations of what is. Saying &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; &ldquo;I know&rdquo; establishes the fulfilled wish.</p><h3>The World as Sensory Resistance</h3><p>&ldquo;The world&rdquo; is the contradiction that outer appearances present. But faculties that abide in the assumption are shielded from this resistance.</p><h3>Faculties as Aspects of Mind</h3><p>&ldquo;I in them&rdquo; means that the assumed state transfers to all parts of self. This is how inner conviction spreads into full alignment.</p><h3>Manifestation Through Inner Harmony</h3><p>When every inner function holds the same belief, outer life must reflect it. Unity within guarantees expression without.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>When interpreted through Neville Goddard&rsquo;s teachings, John 17 becomes a step-by-step process of inner alignment. It teaches how to move from divided thought to psychological wholeness. The &ldquo;glory&rdquo; of the Son is the manifestation that results when every inner function abides in one truth: <em>I AM that which I assume myself to be.</em></p><div class="share-dropdown">
