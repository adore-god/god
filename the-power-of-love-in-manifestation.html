<h1>The Power of Love in Manifestation: A Neville Goddard Perspective</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, <strong>love is not merely an emotion or ideal—it is the power that fuses consciousness with its object</strong>. It is the <strong>substance of assumption</strong>, the felt unity between the self and what is longed for. Love is not passive; it is the <strong>active, imaginal state</strong> of knowing that what you desire is already yours. When you <em>love</em> a state, you become one with it.</p><p>The Bible, when read symbolically as Neville taught, becomes a map of consciousness showing that <strong>love is the gateway to assumption</strong>, and assumption is the mechanism of manifestation. Let us explore this through the figures of the <strong>Good Samaritan</strong>, <strong>David</strong>, and <strong>Jesus</strong>—each of whom demonstrates what it means to assume the state of love and embody it into form.</p><hr><h3><strong>Love as Assumption: The Good Samaritan</strong></h3><p>The parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37) is often read as a moral lesson, but Neville would view it as a psychological allegory. The Samaritan doesn’t merely feel compassion; he <strong>identifies</strong> with the man on the road. He assumes the man’s restoration and acts as though it were already so. This is love in its highest creative expression: <strong>the assumption of oneness with another’s well-being</strong>.</p><p>In Neville’s terms, the Samaritan enters the state of love by imagining the man whole, <em>without separation or delay</em>. He does not deliberate, debate, or doubt—he assumes the truth of healing and moves in that belief. He fuses with the reality he chooses to see.</p><blockquote>
<p>"Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and live in it." – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>This parable teaches us that <strong>to love is to assume the state of fulfilment for another as if it were your own</strong>. It is not emotional sentiment, but <strong>imaginative possession</strong>—the act of inwardly claiming the desired reality and responding to it.</p><hr><h3><strong>David: The Beloved Who Assumed Kingship</strong></h3><p>David, whose name means “beloved,” symbolises the individual who aligns with divine imagination through love. He is described in 1 Samuel 13:14 as <em>a man after God’s own heart</em>, and Neville would interpret this as <strong>a consciousness aligned with the divine ideal</strong>.</p><p>David did not become king because he earned it externally—he embodied it internally. When he faced Goliath, he did not see opposition; he saw confirmation of his assumed identity. David loved God—not as an external figure, but as <strong>his own inner awareness of power</strong>. That love became unity. That unity became assumption. And that assumption took form as kingship.</p><p>To “love God” in Neville’s terms is to feel yourself to be one with the power of creation, to say inwardly: <strong>“I and my Father are one.”</strong> David’s life reveals that <strong>love is the act of assuming your oneness with what you are called to be</strong>.</p><hr><h3><strong>Jesus: Love Embodied as Creative Fixation</strong></h3><p>Jesus, in Neville’s teachings, is not a historical figure but a symbol of <strong>awakened imagination</strong>—the I AM within each of us. His teachings on love are not commandments but <strong>creative laws</strong>. “Love your neighbour as yourself” (Mark 12:31) means: <strong>see your neighbour as yourself in a different state</strong>, and what you assume of them, you assume of yourself.</p><p>Neville interprets the <strong>crucifixion</strong> not as a sacrifice but as a <strong>symbol of fixation</strong>—the moment when a new state is nailed in consciousness. To be “crucified” is to assume so completely that you become one with the imagined state, holding it without flinching until it hardens into fact.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The cross is the state you wear. Fix the idea and it will resurrect.” – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>Jesus’s love is not sentimental—it is creative identification. He imagines the world transformed and remains fixed in that inner knowing. This is how he “saves”: not by dying, but by <strong>assuming the fulfilled state for all</strong>.</p><p>Through love, he enters union with the ideal, and that union becomes reality. <strong>Love is not a response to reality—it is the assumption that creates it</strong>.</p><hr><h3><strong>Love as the Power to Assume and Become</strong></h3><p>For Neville, <strong>love is the means by which you assume and inhabit a new identity</strong>. To love is to move beyond desire into union—to feel as though the thing longed for is already yours. Imagination is the vessel, but love is the fire that fuels it. It is the <strong>acceptance of fulfilment</strong>, emotionally felt and silently known.</p><p>David shows us how loving the divine ideal leads to dominion.<br>
The Samaritan shows us how loving another is assuming their healing.<br>
Jesus shows us that love is the act of becoming what you behold.</p><p>In all cases, <strong>love is the cause of manifestation</strong>—not because it pleases a God, but because it <em>is</em> God in expression.</p><hr><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Law of Assumption Is the Law of Love</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s teachings, <strong>to love is to assume</strong>, and to assume is to create. Love is the highest frequency of identification. It is the state in which there is no separation between self and desire. It does not beg or chase—it claims and becomes.</p><p>When you move into a state of love—toward a person, a condition, or a dream—you are not waiting for it to appear. You are <em>feeling from it</em>. You are <em>becoming it</em>. That is the Law of Assumption.</p><p>And that is what the Bible, rightly read, is always revealing:<br>
<strong>“Love never fails”</strong>—because love assumes unity, and unity is always fulfilled.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-genesis-2-24-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 2:24 Series</a></p>
