<h1>The Word of God: Inner Dialogue and Speech </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<blockquote>
  But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim)". — Romans 10:8
</blockquote>

<p>Neville Goddard teaches that the Bible’s “Word of God” is not an external message but the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">activity of imagination within the individual</a>. Instead of treating the Bible as literal history, he explains that it describes how inner assumptions become outward facts. The <a href="genesis-126-man.html">Word of God</a> is therefore the imaginal word — the thoughts, pictures and assumptions we accept as true.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>The Word of God as Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>Neville reads the creation story in <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">Genesis</a> as a description of how imagination works. When God says, “Let there be…,” it symbolises the individual <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">forming an inner assumption</a>. Creation through speech in Genesis shows that outcomes begin as inner statements of belief. We create our own experience in the same way: what we assume within becomes what we witness without.</p>

<p>This means the “Word” is not something outside of us. It is the inner activity of imagining and assuming.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Genesis 2:24 — Becoming One Flesh</strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
“And they shall become one flesh” — Genesis 2:24
</blockquote><p>This is central in understanding the Bible's narrative. Symbolically, it teaches that two things must join: the imaginal state and the lived experience. When you assume a state in imagination and then live from it, the assumption and your behaviour “become one flesh.”</p>

<p><strong>This is the Law of Assumption in simple terms:</strong> when your inner word (your assumption) and your outer actions unite, the assumption becomes real. The imaginal state takes on physical form.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Imagination as the Source of Creation</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">Genesis creation account</a> is a model for how every person shapes their world. Neville explains that just as God “speaks” creation into existence, we create our experience through the imaginal acts we accept as true. This aligns with <a href="genesis-126-man.html">Genesis 1:26</a>, which presents humanity as having the same creative function symbolically.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>The Word Became Flesh</strong></h3>
<p>John 1:14 says “the Word became flesh.” Neville interprets this psychologically: the inner assumption becomes an external fact. The same principle appears in Genesis 2:24 — what is held within us and what we do outwardly join together, producing a visible result.</p>

<p>In practice, this means every imaginal state will become “flesh” when it is accepted, felt, and lived from.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Mastering Imagination for Transformation</strong></h3>
<p>Neville teaches that imagination must be directed consciously. We shape our lives by choosing what to assume. When we deliberately focus on a desired outcome and feel it as real, we guide our imagination instead of letting old habits guide it for us.</p>

<p>This is not daydreaming. It is the deliberate selection of the state you intend to experience, followed by living from that state until it becomes fact.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>The Role of Words and Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p>Words, both spoken and unspoken, reveal what we assume. In Scripture, words carry creative power because they symbolise inner belief. Neville explains that our speech shows what we have already accepted as true. If we want different results, we must change our inner conversations and assumptions to match the state we desire.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Living in Alignment with Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>To manifest, Neville emphasises “living from the end.” This means adopting the feelings, behaviours and assumptions of the person you would be if the desire were already fulfilled. When this inner state and outer living join — when they become “one flesh” — the imagined state becomes fact.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Neville Goddard shows the Bible as a practical guide to inner creation. “The Word” is imagination, and “the Word becoming flesh” is the process by which our assumptions solidify into experience. Genesis 2:24 reinforces this: the imaginal state and outward behaviour must join to produce a result. By using the Law of Assumption, and accepting the desired state as already true, the imagined becomes real — the word becomes flesh.</p>
