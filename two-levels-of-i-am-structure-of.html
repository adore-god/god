<h1>Two Levels of 'I AM': God and Man are One</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>One of the more mysterious, often overlooked implications in Neville Goddard’s teaching is this: <strong><a href="genesis-126-man.html">God is imagining us, and we are imagining ourselves</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This isn't a contradiction. In fact, it forms the very framework of Neville’s psychological reading of Scripture—where God is not some external being, but <strong>your own wonderful human imagination</strong>. Let’s unpack this dual structure.</p>
<hr>
<h2>God as Imagination: The Original Dreamer</h2>
<p>Neville repeatedly said, <em><a href="i-and-father-are-one-interpreted.html">“God and man are one.”</a></em> Not because man is equal in personality or power to some external deity, but because man’s very <strong>consciousness</strong> is divine in origin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Man is all imagination. Therefore, man must be where he is in imagination, for his imagination is himself.”<br>
— <em>Neville Goddard, Out of this World</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God is not a man in the sky. God is the <strong>I AM</strong>—<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">the root awareness behind all states, the <strong>first principle</strong> of being</a>. In this view, God becomes man, <strong>descends into individuality</strong>, and appears fragmented through us. This is the dream of life.</p>
<p>We are not separate from God in essence, only in <em>appearance</em>. In the deep structure of being, <b><a href="elohim-god.html">God is dreaming us</a></b>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Imagination Within the Dream</h2>
<p>But here’s the layered genius of Neville’s framework: though we are dreamed by God, we are <strong>also dreaming within that dream</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“God became man that man may become God.”<br>
— <em>Neville Goddard, The Law and the Promise</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are not passive. We participate. <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Each individual experiences life according to their inner assumptions and beliefs</a>. Your self-concept—what you assume yourself to be—is the <strong>seed of your experience</strong>. <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">What you are conscious of being, you become.</a></p>
<p>So, within the divine dream of God, <strong>you also imagine yourself into various states</strong>—and those states, like the “many mansions” of Scripture, determine your reality.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Paradox That Awakens</h2>
<p>This duality is not contradiction but <strong>symbolic recursion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>God, as the great <em>I AM</em>, <strong>imagines creation</strong>—including you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, in turn, as a conscious extension of that <em>I am</em>, <strong>imagine your own reality</strong> from within the story.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s the mystery of being. You are the dreamed and the dreamer. The created and the creator. The sleeper and the one awakening.</p>
<p>And as Neville said, <strong>awakening is remembering</strong>. Remembering that the outer world is yourself pushed out. Remembering that every figure, every object, every event is <strong>the shadow of your current state of awareness</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion: Living From the I AM</h2>
<p>Neville’s message is not that God controls you from the outside, nor that you are alone in your power to create. It’s that you are <strong>God become man</strong>, dreaming your way back to full remembrance of Self.</p>
<p>You are imagined by the One Imagination—and <strong>you are also the one who imagines</strong>.</p>
<p>And so, the question is never <em>What is real?</em> but always:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What am I assuming to be true about myself right now?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because whatever that is...<br>
You are living it.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-exodus-3-14--i-am.html">Exodus 3:14: I AM</a> | <a href="label-genesis-1-26-series.html">Genesis 1:26 Series</a></p>
