<h1>Is Jesus God or Not? Discover the Hidden Biblical Truth from Genesis</h1>
<p>For centuries, people have debated the question: <b><i>Is Jesus truly God?</i></b> While many approach this from a literal, historical perspective, there is a deeper and more eye opening way to understand it — one that reveals profound psychological and spiritual concepts.</p>
<p>Through the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Law of Assumption</a>, as taught by Neville Goddard, we discover that Jesus is not an external figure to be worshipped but a personification of imagination and assumption in action. This answer begins in the very first chapters of <a href="genesis-foundational-principles.html">Genesis - the foundational book</a> the biblical narrative is built upon.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Creative Power of 'I AM' in Genesis</strong></h3>
<p>Genesis opens with the majestic statement: <em>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</em> The word translated as <a href="elohim-god.html">"God" is "Elohim,"</a> a plural form suggesting a unified creative force rather than a distant individual deity.</p>
<p>We read that "the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the <a href="label-water-symbolism.html">waters</a>." Symbolically, waters represent the subconscious mind — formless, receptive, and infinite in potential. The creative movement upon these <a href="label-water-symbolism.html">waters</a> is the stirring of imagination itself.</p>
<p>In Genesis 1:26: <em>"<a href="genesis-126-man.html">Let us make man in our image, after our likeness</a>."</em> This "image" is not physical but refers to consciousness. We are expressions of this same creative awareness — the very "<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>." <b>Any male or female character presented in the Bible is a psychological concept of your mind</b>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Revelation of God's Name: 'I AM'</strong></h3>
<p>Later, in Exodus 3:14, God declares: <em>"<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM THAT I AM.</a>"</em></p>
<p>This is not merely a name; it is a statement of pure being. <a href="elohim-god.html">"I AM"</a> is the essence of awareness, the root of all existence.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that this "I AM" is the true God within each person — the consciousness that shapes reality through assumption. The moment you say "I AM" followed by any idea, you are claiming and creating that state.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Jesus: The Personification of 'I AM'</strong></h3>
<p>When <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> says, <b><em>"Before Abraham was, I AM,"</em> or <em>"I AM the way, the truth, and the life,"</em></b> he is not describing himself as a historical figure to be worshipped externally. These are statements of universal truth, pointing directly to the divine creative power within each person.</p>
<p><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> symbolises the highest state of <b>self perception</b> — the complete awakening to one’s creative power and full identification with the assumed end. He embodies the principle of living from the end, knowing and feeling that the desire is already fulfilled.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Other Genesis Patterns Revealing 'I AM'</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>The Woman: Bone of My Bones, Flesh of My Flesh</strong></h4>
<p>In Genesis 2:23, <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Adam declares of Eve</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Symbolically, Adam represents the conscious mind, and Eve represents the subconscious mind. Neville taught that the subconscious receives impressions from the conscious (Adam) and gives form to them — bringing them into "flesh."</p>
<p>This dynamic reveals that whatever you <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">consciously assume </a>and impress upon the subconscious will become your experienced reality. It foreshadows Paul’s statement about Christ and the "church":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones." (Ephesians 5:30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> as "<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>" symbolises this perfect union — the harmonious relationship between conscious assumption and subconscious embodiment.</p>
<hr/>
<h4><strong>Sin, Pleasure, and Anger: Genesis 4:4–7</strong></h4>
<p><a href="genesis-47-sin.html">In the story of Cain and Abel</a>, God says to Cain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If thou doest well, shalt thou not have honour? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, "sin" means "missing the mark" (from the Hebrew <em>chatta’ah</em>). Rather than a moral failing, it points to the failure to assume correctly — to hold to the ideal state in imagination.</p>
<p>Abel represents the offering made in true feeling and faith, while Cain symbolises a mechanical or forced effort without inner alignment.</p>
<p><b>Pleasure </b>and<b> anger </b>are emotional responses that follow from our assumptions. Neville stressed that feeling is the secret: what you truly feel as real determines what you experience. Anger and jealousy, as seen in Cain, arise when one fails to maintain faith in the assumed end — when one "misses the mark."</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Genesis Patterns Foreshadowing Jesus</strong></h3>
<p>These <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">early stories set the stage</a> for the ultimate revelation in Jesus:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adam’s deep sleep</strong> represents humanity’s descent into forgetfulness of its divine nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The seed within itself (Genesis 1:11)</strong> symbolises that every desire already exists within us. Manifestation begins from within, never from chasing outwardly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abraham’s unwavering faith</strong> represents the commitment to unseen reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jacob wrestling the angel</strong> symbolises the persistence needed to sustain an assumption until it becomes fact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as the adventures of <a href="label-joseph-series.html">Joseph</a> and <a href="label-judah-series.html">Judah</a>, each of these themes builds towards the full awakening expressed in Jesus — the realisation of "I AM" as the creative power.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Law of Assumption and the Christ State</strong></h3>
<p>The Law of Assumption teaches that what you persistently assume to be true will harden into fact. Jesus represents the perfected state of fully embodying an assumption, living as though the wish is already fulfilled.</p>
<p>His crucifixion symbolises the fixation of attention upon the desired state, and his resurrection represents rising into this new identity.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>So, <em>is Jesus God?</em></p>
<p>From the perspective of the Law of Assumption and symbolic reading of scripture, Jesus is not an external God to be worshipped. He is the embodiment of our own "I AM" — the divine creative power within each of us.</p>
<p>Genesis lays the foundation, revealing that we are made in the image of consciousness itself. Jesus completes this revelation by showing how to live as that creative power — by fully identifying with our assumptions and allowing them to become flesh.</p>
<p>When seen this way, the Bible transforms from an external narrative into a practical guide for awakening and transformation, revealing that the true "I AM" is always within.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-architecture-series.html">Architecture Series</a> | <a href="label-exodus-3-14--i-am.html">Exodus 3:14: I AM</a> | <a href="label-genesis-1-11-series.html">Genesis 1:11 Series</a> | <a href="label-genesis-2-23-series.html">Genesis 2:23 Series</a> | <a href="label-genesis-2-24-series.html">Genesis 2:24 Series</a></p>
