<h1>Zechariah: Passage Analysis 9:14–17 </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><strong>Zechariah 9:14</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Then the <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">LORD</a> will appear over them; his arrow will flash like lightning. The Sovereign LORD will sound the trumpet; he will march in the storms of the south.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"The LORD will appear over them"</strong><br>
Your awareness of being—the I AM—rises and takes precedence over old beliefs. A higher assumption (the desired state) is now enthroned above the lower state (the present unwanted condition). This is the moment you <strong>consciously choose</strong> a new identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"His arrow will flash like lightning"</strong><br>
A focused desire or assumption, once impressed with clarity and feeling, strikes the subconscious with the speed and power of lightning. The arrow is your <strong>concentrated imaginative act</strong>—it travels with precision and force.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"The <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Sovereign LORD</a> will sound the trumpet"</strong><br>
This signifies <strong>a declaration</strong>—you are making an internal proclamation: “I am now what I desire to be.” The trumpet, like a bold affirmation, awakens and commands the subconscious to bring forth that which has been assumed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"He will march in the storms of the south"</strong><br>
The path to manifestation is not free of emotional turbulence. Yet, this verse shows your <strong>new state moving boldly through emotional resistance</strong>, chaos, and doubt—still in command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Zechariah 9:15</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“And the LORD Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"The <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">LORD Almighty</a> will shield them"</strong><br>
Once you dwell in the end (the wish fulfilled), your assumption becomes <strong>a shield</strong>—it protects your inner world from contrary thoughts. The subconscious aligns with your vision and safeguards it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"They will destroy and overcome with slingstones"</strong><br>
Old doubts and limiting beliefs are cast down by simple yet potent tools—<strong>imagination, inner speech, and feeling</strong>—the symbolic slingstones. Like David against Goliath, small inner acts can overthrow towering outer obstacles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"They will drink and roar as with wine"</strong><br>
This expresses <strong>ecstatic inner conviction</strong>. As Neville often said, feeling is the secret. Drinking wine here symbolises being <strong>intoxicated with the feeling of fulfilment</strong>, roaring with joy and assurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar"</strong><br>
The bowl represents <strong>readiness and spiritual preparation</strong>. You are now full—mentally and emotionally saturated with your assumption—ready to bless every corner of your reality with the new state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Zechariah 9:16</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“The LORD their God will save his people on that day as a shepherd saves his flock. They will sparkle in his land like jewels in a crown.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"The LORD... will save his people"</strong><br>
Salvation, in Neville’s terms, is the <strong>liberation from limitation</strong> through identification with a higher state. Your “people” are the inner faculties—thoughts, feelings, attitudes—rescued and reconditioned by a new assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"As a shepherd saves his flock"</strong><br>
The I AM lovingly guides your thoughts, gathering wandering emotions and focusing them on the desired state—<strong>leading your mind from lack to fulfilment</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"They will sparkle in his land like jewels in a crown"</strong><br>
Your world begins to reflect the new inner state. Just as jewels radiate light, so too does your outer experience shine with <strong>evidence of your sustained assumption</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Zechariah 9:17</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“How attractive and beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men thrive, and new wine the young women.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"How attractive and beautiful they will be!"</strong><br>
This is the moment of <strong>manifestation</strong>—your assumed reality has become visible and desirable. The world now mirrors the beauty of your inner transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Grain will make the young men thrive"</strong><br>
Grain symbolises <strong>sustenance and stability</strong>. The masculine principle—conscious direction—grows strong. Your directed thought, now fed by assumption, is productive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"New wine the young women"</strong><br>
The feminine aspect—<strong>receptivity and feeling</strong>—is refreshed. New wine suggests fresh joy and emotional vitality springing from your fulfilled desire.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Zechariah 9:14–17, interpreted through Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption, reveals not a prophecy of external warfare, but the <strong>inner triumph of imagined identity</strong> over limitation. The I AM—the LORD within—pierces through resistance, declares a new state, and ushers in a life that sparkles with the fruits of assumption.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
