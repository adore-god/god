<h1>God Became Man So That Man Might Become God</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption is grounded in the idea that <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">you become what you consciously accept as true</a>. This isn’t just positive thinking—it’s the ancient spiritual truth hidden in the Bible: <em>“<a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> became <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> so that man might become God.”</em></p><blockquote>
<p>“To whom, though himself in the form of God, it did not seem that to take for oneself was to be like God; But he made himself as nothing, taking the form of a servant, being made like men;.”— <em>Philippians 2:6–7</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville taught that this describes <a href="elohim-god.html">imagination</a> descending into human limitation. When you forget your true identity and identify with lack, fear, or struggle, you are the Word made flesh—God becoming man.</p><p>This descent is not accidental—it is built into the structure of the story itself. The Bible begins not with a list of laws, but with a vision—a dream of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">creation</a>.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Let us make man in our image.”<br>
— <em>Genesis 1:26</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is not the voice of distant deities, but the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">chorus of man’s own inner powers speaking</a>.<br>
Man is the dreamer, the image, and the God who forms it.</p><p>This is the journey Neville mapped so clearly: when you <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume the feeling of your desired state</a>, believing it to be real even before it appears, you retrace that path. You rise from the forgetfulness of limitation to the knowing of conscious creation. You are man becoming God.</p><p>The story of the Prodigal Son in Luke 15 illustrates this beautifully. The son falls into a far country—into forgetfulness—living beneath his true inheritance. But when he remembers who he is and returns to his father’s house (assumes the truth of his being), he is welcomed as though he had never left. This is the return from the assumption of separation to the assumption of power.</p><p>Neville’s brilliance was in showing that this is not theory. It is something you practise. Assume the state, and you give it life. This is the mystery of Scripture—<em><a href="pauls-mysteries-and-revelation-of.html">Christ in you, the hope of glory</a></em>—unfolding as your own awakening.</p><hr/><p><strong>Footnote</strong><br>
The phrase <em>“God became man so that man might become God”</em> is most famously attributed to Athanasius of Alexandria, a 4th-century Church Father. In his work <em>On the Incarnation</em>, he wrote:</p><blockquote>
<p>“For the Son of God became man so that we might become God.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This early Christian teaching, known as <em>theosis</em> or <em>divinisation</em>, aligns closely—though not identically—with Neville Goddard’s view: that imagination is the divine in man, and awakening to that truth is the journey of salvation.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
