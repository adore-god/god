<h1>The Disciples as States of Awareness:  List of Attributes </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In the traditional, literal view, the twelve disciples are seen as historical followers of Jesus — men who physically accompanied him in first-century Judea. But when read through the psychological understanding offered by Neville Goddard, a more intimate and empowering meaning emerges.</p><p>The disciples are not external companions but symbolic faculties of mind — the inner <a href="elohim-god.html"><em>Elohim</em></a> (the "judges, rulers, and powers" within you) deliberately <a href="the-calling-of-twelve-gospel-story.html">chosen to support the assumption</a>. Each disciple represents a spiritual quality or mental state you must consciously select to sustain the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p><p>These twelve states are not passive traits; they are dynamic, living aspects of consciousness. They form the ordered inner <a href="elohim-god.html">council of <em>Elohim</em></a>, working together to shape your self-perception and create your world.</p><p>Crucially, they are chosen by <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> — the personification of your own wonderful human imagination, your "I AM." The act of Jesus selecting the twelve reflects the conscious movement within you: your deeper self, the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">"I AM,"</a> calls forth and names these inner states to support the embodiment of your desire.</p><p>As it is written, </p><p></p><blockquote>"You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you" (John 15:16). </blockquote><p></p><p>In this psychological drama, your inner <em>Elohim</em> — the collective power of mind — organises and directs these faculties, guiding them to serve the realisation of your assumption.</p><hr><h3><strong>1. Peter – Awareness of Faith</strong></h3><p><em>“And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church”</em> (Matthew 16:18).<br>
<a href="el/peter-rock-that wavers.html">Peter represents foundational faith</a>. It is your inner commitment to believe that imagination is the creative power. Peter is your willingness to walk on water—to trust the unseen.</p><hr><h3><strong>2. Andrew – Awareness of Inner Movement</strong></h3><p><em>“Andrew... first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith... We have found the Messiah”</em> (John 1:40–41).<br>
Andrew’s immediacy shows readiness and eagerness to move toward the wish fulfilled. His inner movement reflects the shift from desire to assumption.</p><hr><h3><strong>3. James the Elder – Awareness of Discernment</strong></h3><p><em>“James the son of Zebedee... he called them: And they left their father Zebedee… and went after him”</em> (Mark 1:19–20).<br>
James leaves behind inherited thinking ("the father") to follow higher awareness. This symbolises your discernment in choosing only thoughts aligned with your aim.</p><hr><h3><strong>4. John – Awareness of Loving Union</strong></h3><p><em>“The disciple whom Jesus loved”</em> (John 13:23).<br>
John represents emotional oneness. This is the inner state of love and fusion with the end—feeling the wish fulfilled as already accomplished.</p><hr><h3><strong>5. Philip – Awareness of Vision</strong></h3><p><em>“Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father”</em> (John 14:8).<br>
Philip seeks vision and clarity. He reminds you to see imaginatively and to look beyond appearances toward the reality your heart sees first.</p><hr><h3><strong>6. Bartholomew – Awareness of Inner Clarity</strong></h3><p>While little is recorded of Bartholomew, he is traditionally paired with Nathanael, of whom it is said:<br>
<em>“Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile”</em> (John 1:47).<br>
This represents purity of thought—clarity, sincerity, and trust in divine inner guidance.</p><hr><h3><strong>7. Thomas – Awareness of Inner Proof</strong></h3><p><em>“Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands… be not faithless, but believing”</em> (John 20:27).<br>
Thomas represents the felt reality of inner evidence. You trust the inner conviction more than the outer facts.</p><hr><h3><strong>8. Matthew – Awareness of Identity Shift</strong></h3><p><em>“And as Jesus passed forth... he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him”</em> (Matthew 9:9).<br>
Matthew leaves behind his role as tax collector—symbolising your abandonment of the old self-image and assumption of a new identity.</p><hr><h3><strong>9. James the Less – Awareness of Divine Order</strong></h3><p>Though not much is said of James the Less, his name suggests humility and order.<br>
<em>“God is not the author of confusion, but of peace”</em> (1 Corinthians 14:33).<br>
He embodies inner awareness that manifestation happens in divine sequence. You do not force it—you trust the process.</p><hr><h3><strong>10. Simon the Zealot – Awareness of Passionate Devotion</strong></h3><p>Simon was called a Zealot (Luke 6:15), indicating fervour.<br>
His name reflects inner fire—emotional persistence that keeps your attention steady and alive toward the desired outcome.</p><hr><h3><strong>11. Jude (Thaddeus) – Awareness of Praise</strong></h3><p><em>“Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ…”</em> (Jude 1:1).<br>
Jude, also called Thaddeus, represents gratitude and inner joy. Praise is not mere politeness—it is the atmosphere of the fulfilled soul.</p><hr><h3><strong>12. Judas – Awareness of Total Surrender</strong></h3><p><em>“That thou doest, do quickly”</em> (John 13:27).<br>
Judas represents the final release of the old identity. He hands over the former self so that the new may rise. This is the surrender of doubt, fear, and delay.</p><hr><h2><strong>The Inner Circle of Manifestation</strong></h2><p>When seen through Neville Goddard’s symbolic understanding, the disciples form not a cast of external characters, but an <strong>inner circle of support</strong>—a set of twelve spiritual attitudes that align you with the creative power of “I AM”. These states of awareness, once deliberately chosen and inhabited, bring forth the manifestation you seek.</p><p>You are not waiting for Jesus to walk beside you. You are awakening to the truth that <strong>he is your own wonderful human imagination</strong>—selecting and sending forth these inner qualities that whisper:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“It is finished.”</em> (John 19:30)</p></blockquote><div class="share-dropdown">
