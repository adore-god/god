<blockquote>“And God said, ‘Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.’ And it was so.” — Genesis 1:11</blockquote>
<p>Genesis 1:11 is more than an observation about nature, it is the architecture of reality. This verse declares that <strong>everything contains its future within itself</strong>, encoded as seed. That seed carries not just form but nature—<strong>each produces after its kind</strong>. This is the metaphysical law behind all creation: <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">you experience not what you wish for, but what you are</a></strong>.</p>
<p>When viewed through Neville Goddard’s teachings, this verse emerges as the pattern for every transformation story in Scripture. It also introduces—implicitly but unmistakably—the two trees of Eden: <strong>the Tree of Life</strong> and <strong>the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</strong>. These are not botanical curiosities; they are <strong>spiritual metaphors</strong>, <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">each representing the full-grown result of a specific inner state</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Seed in Itself: Consciousness Bears Fruit</strong></h3>
<p>Neville taught that <strong>imagination is the only creative power</strong>, and <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-1-11-series.html">every outer condition is the outpicturing of an inner assumption</a>. Genesis 1:11 affirms this: what you carry inwardly <strong>reproduces itself</strong>, in form and quality. The world is not imposed on you—it is grown from you.</p>
<p><a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">A fearful assumption produces a fearful world. A confident assumption produces a life of favour.</a> The seed cannot betray its nature. It does not “learn” what to become—it simply <strong>unfolds what it already is</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the silent law behind every life experience, and it’s not retributive but <strong>causative</strong>. You reap because you sow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. <br> </p> <p> 
Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver." — 2 Corinthians 9:6-7
</p>
<small class="blockquote-cap"> 
Cheerful giving is first defined in <span class="noTag"> Genesis 4:4-7 </span> under <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">sin </a>
</small>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Eden: The Trees as Conscious Pathways</strong></h3>
<p>In Eden, the <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-genesis-1-11-series.html">seed principle</a> becomes story. The garden is the mind, and at its centre are <strong>two trees</strong>, <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">representing two modes of consciousness:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</strong> is the outgrowth of duality—of seeing the world as divided, external, and full of opposites. It represents the mind that reacts, judges, and sees itself at the mercy of circumstance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Tree of Life</strong> stands for unity, creative faith, and inner causation. It is the life-giving imagination used with purpose and trust—<a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html"><strong>the assumption of the wish fulfilled</strong>.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both trees are grown from seed—the inner perception that leads to them. This is why the verse says “fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed.” Your inner state is always sowing. What grows depends on what you’ve planted.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Trees Across Scripture: The Seed Principle in Action</strong></h3>
<p>The Bible continues to use <strong>trees</strong> as markers of spiritual state—evidence that <strong>seeded consciousness becomes visible form</strong>. Consider these examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Nebuchadnezzar’s tree in Daniel 4</strong>: the great tree seen in his dream symbolised his dominion—an outward expression of his self-image. When that self-image became inflated, the tree was cut down. His fall was not punishment; <a href="daniel-chapter-4-verses-1-18-symbolism.html">it was the result of the <strong>seed of pride maturing into consequence</strong>.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="fig-trees-and-false-appearances-eden.html">Jesus and the fig tree (Mark 11)</a></strong>: Jesus finds the fig tree with no fruit and curses it, and it withers. This isn’t anger—it’s symbolic. <strong>A state of being that offers no real nourishment</strong>—no fruit—cannot be sustained. What is lifeless within must pass away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Psalm 1</strong> describes the blessed man as “a tree planted by rivers of water,” whose leaf does not wither. Why? Because “his delight is in the law of the Lord”—the spiritual law that consciousness creates reality. He meditates day and night—<strong>sowing deliberately</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In Revelation 22</strong>, the tree of life reappears, bearing fruit each month, its leaves “for the healing of the nations.” This is not a future location, but <strong>a healed consciousness</strong>, consistently yielding the fruit of inner alignment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trees in Scripture are never background—they are <strong>symbolic confirmations</strong> that the inner world becomes the outer form. <strong>They are the mature embodiment of seed—of assumption.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Every Story Grows from Genesis 1:11</strong></h3>
<p>The pattern set in Genesis 1:11 never breaks; it underlies <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus’</a> well-known saying:</p><p></p><blockquote>"Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.” — Matthew 17:20</blockquote><p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Abraham’s promise</strong>: <em>“So shall your seed be”</em> (Genesis 15:5). <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham’s entire life becomes the unfolding of this seed—faith in the unseen.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Joseph’s journey</strong>: His dream is the seed. Betrayal, imprisonment, and elevation are the unfolding. His life, like a tree, is <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html"><strong>rooted in a vision</strong>, not in conditions</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Kingdom parables of Jesus</strong>: <em>“The <a href="elohim-god.html">Kingdom of God</a> is as if a man should cast seed into the ground...”</em> (Mark 4:26). The whole mystery of spiritual growth is illustrated through <strong>hidden seed becoming visible fruit</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The crucifixion itself</strong>: Neville saw this as the fixing of an assumption—the moment when <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html">a new identity is planted so deeply in imagination that it must rise again in changed form</a>. <strong>The cross is the planting; the resurrection is the fruit.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Made in His Image: To Imagine Is to Sow</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“So God created man in his own image...” — Genesis 1:27</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be <a href="genesis-126-man.html">made in God’s image is to imagine</a>, to choose, to sow. You are not here to passively observe creation. You are the one sowing the seed by every assumption, thought, and emotional tone you hold.</p>
<p>This is why Neville urged students to <strong>stop blaming the world</strong>. The outer is never first. The seed is first. And <strong>the seed is in you</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Let It Be So</strong></h3>
<p>Genesis 1:11 ends with the simple phrase: <em>“And it was so.”</em> No delay. No effort. Assumption accepted, manifestation follows.</p>
<p>This is the rhythm of spiritual creation. You are the earth. Your inner state is the seed. The life that grows around you is the tree.</p>
<p>You do not need permission, signs, or ideal conditions. The seed already exists in you. The trees of Scripture—from Eden to Daniel, from Psalms to Revelation—<strong>stand as witnesses</strong> to this truth: <strong>you are sowing your future now.</strong></p>
