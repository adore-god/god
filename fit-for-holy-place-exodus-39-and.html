<main class="content"><article>
<p></p><blockquote>"And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold… and wrote upon it… HOLINESS TO THE LORD.” </blockquote><div><img alt="Priest Crown Icon The Way" border="0" data-original-height="606" data-original-width="710" height="171" src="images/Untitled%20Design_1-3.webp" width="200"/></div><p>Exodus 39 majestically details the making of the priestly garments, a passage often overlooked as historical record. Yet when viewed through the spiritual teachings of Neville Goddard—who emphasised the power of assumption and imagination—these garments become rich symbols of consciousness, identity, and the inner transformation required to manifest our desires. This commentary explores each section of the chapter not as an ancient ritual, but as a blueprint for dressing the inner man in the qualities of the fulfilled wish. Through fabric, colour, and craftsmanship, Exodus 39 reveals how we weave the reality we live.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Exodus 39:1 – The Service Garments Are Woven</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place…”</em> (v. 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Blue</strong> reflects the imagination’s clear vision of the unseen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purple</strong> (a blend of blue and red) symbolises the union of spiritual insight with passionate desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scarlet</strong> represents the vivid feeling you bring to your assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Cloths of service”</em> remind us that every assumption is an act of worship—service to an imagined end.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Neville’s terms, these colours are states of consciousness you assume within your inner theatre. To “do service” is to maintain that state until it hardens into fact.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Verses 2–7 – Crafting the Ephod</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen… And he set the two onyx stones upon the shoulders of the ephod…”</em> (vv. 2, 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>ephod</strong> is your new self-concept, sewn of the finest linen (purity of thought) and embroidered with the assumed qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gold</strong> threads speak of the awareness of richness in imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>onyx stones</strong>, engraved with the names of the tribes (Israel), represent every former state you’ve passed through. Placed on the shoulders, they signify how past experiences now support your present assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“As the LORD commanded Moses.”</em> (v. 7)<br>
Moses here stands for your conscious “I AM” awareness. When your assumption is perfectly imagined, your inner law affirms, “It is done.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Verses 8–21 – The Breastplate of Judgement</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And he made the breastplate of cunning work, after the work of the ephod… it was foursquare: they made the breastplate…”</em> (vv. 8–9)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>breastplate</strong> sits over the heart, where feeling resides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Twelve precious stones</strong>, each bearing a tribe’s name, form a complete circle of emotional conviction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gold settings hold each stone, just as your unshakeable assumption holds every feeling in place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate…”</em> (v. 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aaron (your inner priest) carries these names—states you claim—as he enters the sanctuary of imagination.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Verses 22–26 – The Robe of Blue</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue… And upon the hem of it… pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, round about the hem…”</em> (vv. 22–24)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>robe of blue</strong> signifies life completely woven of imaginative vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pomegranates</strong> (fruitfulness) and <strong>bells</strong> (vibration) alternate around the hem—symbolising the rhythm of feeling and imagining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Neville taught, <em>“Feeling is the secret.”</em> Here the pomegranate-bell motif reminds you to sustain feeling until the garment (your new identity) moves and sounds like reality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Verses 27–29 – Tunics, Mitre and Girdle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And they made coats of fine linen… and the mitre of fine linen… and the girdle of needlework…”</em> (vv. 27–29)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Coats of linen</strong> are the daily disciplines of assuming your desire already fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>mitre</strong> (headpiece) carries the word “Holiness” (set-apart assumption) on its front plate. This is your dominant thought: <em>“I AM _____.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>girdle</strong> binds the whole, reminding you to tie every thought and feeling around your assumption, preventing stray doubts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Verses 30–31 – The Plate and Its Inscription</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold… and wrote upon it… HOLINESS TO THE LORD.”</em> (vv. 30–31)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>gold plate</strong> is the conscious declaration of your chosen identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Holiness to the Lord”</em> is Neville’s version of <em>“I AM THAT I AM”</em>—the unalterable assumption fixed in imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like a signet, it seals your assumption on the subconscious.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Verses 32–43 – Presentation and Perfection</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Thus was all the work of the tabernacle… And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded…”</em> (vv. 32, 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every detail was brought before Moses—your self-awareness—and pronounced <em>“good.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This mirrors the final stage: after living in the assumed state long enough, you step back and accept that <em>“it is finished.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no struggle now; the imagined end wears itself as naturally as these garments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>The Symbolism of Clothing in Scripture</h2>
<p>Clothing in the Bible consistently represents identity, assumption, and inner transformation—never merely outward appearance. Neville Goddard interpreted garments as states of consciousness worn in the imagination:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clothing as Identity</strong><br>
<em>“They were clothed in sackcloth”</em> (Joel 2:12) refers not to literal mourning but to assuming a sorrowful state. In contrast, <em>“He has clothed me with the garments of salvation”</em> (Isaiah 61:10) refers to joy adopted inwardly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dress of Righteousness</strong><br>
When Paul says <em>“Put on the Lord Jesus Christ”</em> (Romans 13:14), he is describing what Neville would call feeling the reality of your desire already fulfilled—adopting the assumption of the new man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transformation Garments</strong><br>
Revelation’s <em>“white robes”</em> (Revelation 3:5) are the purity of consciousness that results from persistent assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing Clothes as Inner Change</strong><br>
When Joseph’s coat is taken from him (Genesis 37), it symbolises the loss or shift of identity. To be re-clothed is to re-identify with a new role—just as you do when consciously assuming a new state in Neville’s teachings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, to be clothed in Scripture is always to be dressed in your accepted self-concept. Whether joy, righteousness, sorrow, or majesty—what you wear inwardly is what the world reflects back to you. In Neville’s words: <em>“You are what you assume that you are.”</em></p><div class="share-dropdown">
