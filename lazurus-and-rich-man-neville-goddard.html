<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, every biblical story is a symbolic representation of the <a href="elohim-god.html">workings of consciousness</a>, imagination, and the law of assumption. The story of <a href="jesus-wept-for-easter-sunday.html">Lazarus</a> and the Rich Man is no different. Through Neville's lens, this parable is about the relationship between our inner states—the poor (humble consciousness) and the rich (self-centered, ego-driven consciousness)—and the manifestation of our beliefs in our external world.</p>
<h3>The Story of Lazarus and the Rich Man</h3>
<p>In Luke 16:19-31, Lazarus is a poor man who suffers in life but eventually finds peace after death, while the rich man lives a life of luxury and self-indulgence, only to suffer in the afterlife. The rich man sees Lazarus in the “bosom of Abraham” (a place of peace) while he himself is in torment and calls out for help.</p>
<h3>Neville Goddard’s Metaphysical Interpretation:</h3>
<p>Lazarus represents the humble, poor consciousness, the subconscious mind that is open and receptive, yet often overlooked or ignored. This represents a state of being where there are no rigid attachments to material wealth or the ego. Lazarus’ sores represent the pain or suffering caused by false beliefs—but this suffering is ultimately what opens the mind to transformation, to the deeper awareness of one's divine nature.</p>
<p>The Rich Man symbolizes the conscious mind that is focused on materialism, wealth, and egoic desires. His riches represent the false sense of security that comes from external achievements and material accumulation. The self-centered consciousness that believes it is separate from the divine, focused solely on the external, is spiritually poor, even though it may appear to be outwardly prosperous.</p>

<h3>The Spiritual Meaning of the Parable:</h3>

<h4>The Role of Consciousness: </h4><p> 
The rich man, despite his material wealth, is in spiritual torment because he is disconnected from the deeper, divine truth of his being. He has not cultivated a humble heart or a receptive mind like Lazarus, which is why he remains spiritually poor. His wealth is a symbol of the ego's attachment to external validation, which can never provide true peace or fulfillment.</p>

<h4>Lazarus and the Receptive Subconscious:</h4> <p> 
Lazarus, on the other hand, despite his external poverty, represents a consciousness that is open, humble, and receptive to divine wisdom and the inner guidance of the subconscious. Lazarus does not cling to the external world but accepts his suffering and uses it to open himself to a deeper connection with the divine, represented by his eventual resting in the bosom of Abraham—a symbol of peace, rest, and spiritual fulfillment.</p>

<h4>The Great Divide: </h4> <p>
The great chasm that separates the rich man from Lazarus after death is symbolic of the mental division between the self-centered ego and the receptive, humble consciousness. This chasm reflects the division between those who live in the illusion of separation from their divine source (the rich man) and those who have surrendered their ego and embraced their spiritual nature (Lazarus). The rich man is separated from the divine peace that Lazarus experiences because of his attachment to the material world and his failure to recognize the divine within him.</p>
<h3>The Parable as a Lesson on Assumption and Belief:</h3>

<p>The rich man’s request to send Lazarus back to warn his brothers (who are still alive) is symbolic of how the mind must come to the realization that it is not enough to rely on external forms or worldly knowledge. The rich man believes that if his brothers could see a miracle, they would change their ways. But Abraham (the symbol of divine wisdom) tells him that if they do not listen to the messages already available to them, they will not change. This represents the law of assumption—the idea that your assumptions, beliefs, and inner states are what create your external reality. No external evidence can change your inner beliefs unless you are willing to change your assumptions first.</p>

<p>The rich man’s torment and Lazarus’ peace reflect the consequence of one’s inner assumptions and beliefs. The suffering of the rich man is a result of his attachment to false beliefs and a focus on external wealth. Lazarus, on the other hand, finds peace because he is not attached to material wealth or status. He is open to the divine nature within him, which brings him peace despite external circumstances.</p>
<h3>The Takeaway:</h3><p>Through Neville Goddard’s lens, the story of Lazarus and the Rich Man teaches us about the power of consciousness and assumption.</p>
<p>Lazarus represents the humble, receptive state of mind that aligns with the divine power of the subconscious mind. He teaches us that true wealth lies in spiritual awareness and acceptance of our divine nature, not in the external accumulation of riches.</p>

<p>The Rich Man symbolizes the ego-driven mind, focused on external forms and materialism, which leads to spiritual poverty and suffering.</p>

<p>The divide between the two represents the mental chasm between those who are attached to the ego and the material world and those who have surrendered to divine wisdom and live in alignment with their true nature.</p>
<p>The parable is a lesson about the law of assumption, emphasizing that our beliefs and inner assumptions shape the life we experience. If we remain attached to the material world and the false beliefs of the ego, we will experience separation and suffering. But if we humble ourselves and align our consciousness with the divine, we will experience true peace, wealth, and fulfillment.</p>
