<h1>Interpreting the Song of Solomon through the Teachings of Neville Goddard</h1>
<p>The Song of Solomon is often read as a sensual dialogue between lovers—but when interpreted through Neville Goddard’s revelations, it unveils something far deeper: the journey of the soul as it unites with its imagined ideal.</p>
<p>This is not a romance of flesh. It is the unfolding of union between awareness (I AM - Ex 3:14) and its chosen state. The mystic knows that each longing, each image, each word is a movement of creation within.</p>
<p>The following verses explore that mystery through Neville’s understanding of imagination, feeling, and assumption.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.</strong><br/>
<em>Song of Solomon 1:2</em></p>
<p>Imagination's kiss is the moment of full acceptance. This is not a physical embrace, but the impression of desire upon consciousness. Neville would call this the “felt reality” of assumption—sweeter, deeper, and more intoxicating than the outer world could ever offer.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem…</strong><br/>
<em>1:5</em></p>
<p>Here, the soul acknowledges its current condition—perhaps marked by hardship or limitation—but affirms its inherent beauty. The daughters of Jerusalem are external states of mind that judge by appearances. But imagination sees beyond. It knows its power to redeem.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers…</strong><br/>
<em>1:4</em></p>
<p>The “drawing” is desire. To run after it is to focus the whole self upon the imagined end. The “king” is imagination itself, and his chambers are the inner realm—where assumption is made, where union takes place. This is the place of conception.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.</strong><br/>
<em>1:14</em></p>
<p>The beloved is the assumed state—vivid, fragrant, and healing. Engedi, a fertile oasis, symbolises the richness of the inner world. Even when the outer life seems barren, imagination is always abundant when we dwell in our chosen end.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</strong><br/>
<em>2:5</em></p>
<p>Here the soul experiences the ache of desire not yet fulfilled. Neville often spoke of the tension that precedes manifestation. The flagons and apples are images of inner support—reminders to remain faithful, for the harvest is near.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</strong><br/>
<em>2:10</em></p>
<p>This is the call from within. The imagined self, already perfected, beckons the soul upward. It is an invitation to leave behind the state of lack and rise into the identity of fulfilment. "Come away" is the inner cry of imagination, drawing you into your ideal.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>I sleep, but my heart waketh…</strong><br/>
<em>5:2</em></p>
<p>Though the conscious mind rests, the subconscious remains ever awake. The heart—often used in Scripture to symbolise the subconscious—continues its work. Neville taught that even in silence, the feeling impressed upon the heart is shaping the world to come.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Set me as a seal upon thine heart… for love is strong as death.</strong><br/>
<em>8:6</em></p>
<p>To set the beloved “as a seal” is to make the assumption permanent. Love—deep conviction, unwavering inner union—is the force that brings all things into being. Just as death ends separation in the natural, so does love end separation in the spiritual. What is felt as true becomes fact.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-song-of-solomon-series.html">Song of Solomon Series</a></p>
