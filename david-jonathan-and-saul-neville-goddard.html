<h1>David, Jonathan and Saul: Love Taking Precedence</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The story of <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David</a>, Jonathan, and Saul personifies separating from the old identity, and loyally <a href="genesis-224-love.html"><i>cleaving</i> or <i>knitting</i> to what you love</a> — fully joining yourself to the new state in unwavering union.</p>
<hr>
<h2>David: The Wish Fulfilled</h2>
<p>David represents the new aim - "I AM that I AM" —the <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">beloved new self beginning to gain strength</a>. When you dare to imagine yourself as someone greater, that state arises in you. Though unseen by the world, it is already chosen and anointed by imagination.</p>
<blockquote>
“I have found David… a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.”
— Acts 13:22
</blockquote>
<p><a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David’s name means “beloved,”</a> reflecting the state of your imagined self that is fully embraced. His victory over Goliath is your victory over limiting beliefs — defeating doubt with focused, confident assumption.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Goliath: The Giant of Limiting Beliefs</h2>
<blockquote>
“And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath…”
— 1 Samuel 17:4
</blockquote>
<p>Goliath represents the loud, mocking voice of limitation. David refuses Saul’s heavy armour, choosing instead the smooth stone — the pure, unwavering thought acting from conviction.</p>
<blockquote>
“You come to me with a sword… but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts…”
— 1 Samuel 17:45
</blockquote>
<p>Neville taught: imagination creates reality. Obstacles are overcome not by force, but by assuming the victory in mind and heart.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Saul: The Old Self Resisting Change</h2>
<p>Saul symbolises the old self—the established state clinging to what is familiar. He is the reigning king in your consciousness, threatened by the new self rising.</p>
<blockquote>
“And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.”
— 1 Samuel 18:9
</blockquote>
<p>As David rises, Saul becomes restless and jealous. Neville explained that old beliefs resist fiercely, but persistence in the new assumption ensures their eventual fall.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Jonathan: The Heart of Loyalty</h2>
<blockquote>
“And it came to pass… the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.”
— 1 Samuel 18:1
</blockquote>
<p>Jonathan represents the heart of loyalty — the part of you that recognises the new assumption and commits to it. Though Saul’s son, he supports and protects David, the new state. His loyalty shows how a sincere heart moves in favour of what has been revealed as true, even before the world sees it.</p>
<p>Jonathan’s soul being "knit" to David symbolises the moment your heart fully accepts your desire. He lays down his robe and weapons, treating David as king before any external confirmation.</p>
<blockquote>
“Jonathan stripped himself of the robe… and gave it to David.”
— 1 Samuel 18:4
</blockquote>
<p>This act captures living from the end: acting as though your desire is already fulfilled and supporting the inner vision before the world acknowledges it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Young Boy and the Arrows: Emerging Desire</h2>
<p>Jonathan sends a <a href="the-arrows-aiming-toward-mark.html">young boy to gather arrows</a> as a sign to David (1 Samuel 20). The boy represents the early stage of your desire — fragile but alive.</p>
<p>Like the young man who flees naked in Mark 14:51–52, he reflects a newly born assumption that feels exposed but is real evidence that the new state is forming.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Gift of Alignment: Jonathan’s Name</h2>
<p>Jonathan’s name, Yehonatan, meaning “Yahweh has given,” reflects the heart of loyalty that recognises truth and moves toward it. It is that quiet knowing when you sense peace about your desire and understand, “This is mine.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Drama: Saul, Jonathan, and David</h2>
<p>This is not external history — it is your own consciousness in motion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>David:</strong> the new, beloved state — your imagined self, fulfilled.</li>
<li><strong>Saul:</strong> the fearful old self, clinging to control.</li>
<li><strong>Jonathan:</strong> the heart of loyalty, devoted to the vision of your true self.</li>
<li><strong>The young boy:</strong> your early manifestation — small, tender, but alive.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you defeat Goliath (limiting beliefs) and allow Jonathan (the heart of loyalty) to knit to David (the wish fulfilled), Saul (the old self) must step aside.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion: Knit Your Soul to the Beloved</h2>
<blockquote>
“Delight yourself also in the LORD, and He shall give you the desires of your heart.”
— Psalm 37:4
</blockquote>
<p>To manifest, follow Jonathan’s example: knit your heart to the beloved state before it appears. Support your <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">Beloved "David"</a>. Honour the promise in you. Defeat doubt with faith.</p>
<p>When the heart of loyalty aligns with the new state and the old self steps aside, manifestation is certain.</p>
<blockquote>
“And the LORD was with David…”
— 1 Samuel 18:14
</blockquote>
<p>So too is the Lord — your I AM — with anyone who claims the end as already true.</p>
