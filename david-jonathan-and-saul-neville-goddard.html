<h1>David, Jonathan and Saul: Love Taking Precedence</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<div><img border="0" class="icon2" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="744" height="200" src="images/1748252551780%20(4).jpg" width="186"/></div><div>The story of David, Jonathan, and Saul is about the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">act of <i>cleaving</i> or <i>knitting</i> to that which you love</a> — fully joining yourself to the new self, the fulfilled state, in unwavering union.</div><hr><h3>David: The Wish Fulfilled</h3><p>David represents the new state—the wish fulfilled. When you dare to imagine yourself as someone greater, that state (David) is born within you. Though it starts unseen and unrecognised by the world, it is already chosen and anointed by imagination.</p><blockquote>
<p>“I have found David… a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.”<br>
— Acts 13:22</p>
</blockquote><p>David’s name means “beloved,” signifying the state in which God (your own I AM consciousness) delights. He embodies the boldness and faith required to assume your desired identity. His victory over Goliath is your victory over limiting beliefs—slaying the giant of doubt with the single stone of focused, confident assumption.</p><hr><h3>Goliath: The Giant of Limiting Beliefs</h3><blockquote>
<p>“And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath…”<br>
— 1 Samuel 17:4</p>
</blockquote><p>Goliath represents the loud, mocking voice of limitation—those internal fears that shout, “It’s impossible!” David refuses Saul’s heavy armour (external methods), choosing instead the smooth stone—the pure, unwavering thought hurled from inner conviction.</p><blockquote>
<p>“You come to me with a sword… but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts…”<br>
— 1 Samuel 17:45</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the secret Neville taught: imagination creates reality. You overcome outer obstacles not by force, but by inwardly assuming your victory.</p><hr><h3>Saul: The Old Self Resisting Change</h3><p>Saul symbolises the old self—the established state of consciousness that clings to what is familiar and fears being replaced. He is the reigning king within you, deeply threatened by the emergence of a new self-concept.</p><blockquote>
<p>“And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.”<br>
— 1 Samuel 18:9</p>
</blockquote><p>As your new desire (David) rises, the old self (Saul) becomes restless and jealous. Neville explained that when you assume a new identity, old beliefs will resist fiercely, yet their downfall is inevitable if you persist in your assumption.</p><hr><h3>Jonathan: The Higher Self in Devotion</h3><blockquote>
<p>“And it came to pass… the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.”<br>
— 1 Samuel 18:1</p>
</blockquote><p>Jonathan embodies the higher self—the divine intuitive faculty within that instantly recognises truth and aligns with it. Though Jonathan is Saul’s son, he does not serve the old self. Instead, he supports and protects David, the new identity.</p><p>Jonathan’s soul being "knit" to David symbolises the moment your inner spiritual awareness wholly embraces your desire. This is not mere admiration—it is union. Jonathan does not wait for David to be crowned; he lays down his robe and weapons in symbolic surrender, treating David as king before any external confirmation.</p><blockquote>
<p>“And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe… and gave it to David.”<br>
— 1 Samuel 18:4</p>
</blockquote><p>This act captures the essence of living from the end: behaving as though your desire is already fulfilled, supporting the inner vision before the world acknowledges it.</p><hr><h3>The Young Boy and the Arrows: The Tender, Emerging Desire</h3><p>In a later scene, Jonathan sends a young boy to gather arrows as a sign to David (1 Samuel 20). The boy is innocent and unaware of the deeper meaning behind his actions. Symbolically, he represents the fragile, early stage of your manifested desire—young, vulnerable, but real.</p><p>Like the young man who flees naked in Mark’s Gospel (Mark 14:51–52), the boy signifies a newly born assumption that feels exposed and unprotected. Though small, this emerging self is evidence that the new state is taking shape and moving toward full expression.</p><hr><h3>The Gift of Alignment: Jonathan’s Name</h3><p>Jonathan’s name—Yehonatan, meaning “Yahweh has given”—reveals his role as the divine faculty that recognises and moves toward truth without reasoning. It is that moment within when you feel a quiet, unwavering peace about your desire and know, “This is mine.”</p><p>This inner gift is essential. The higher self joins fully with the new state and refuses to turn back—this is the knitting of souls.</p><hr><h3>The Drama Within: Saul, Jonathan, and David</h3><p>This drama is not external history—it is your own consciousness in motion.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong> is your new, beloved state—your imagined self, already fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saul</strong> is the fearful old self clinging to control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jonathan</strong> is your higher self, loyal to the vision of what you truly are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The young boy</strong> is your early manifestation—vulnerable but alive.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>When you slay the Goliath of limiting beliefs and allow Jonathan (the higher self) to knit to David (the wish fulfilled), Saul (the old self) must inevitably fall away.</p><hr><h3>Conclusion: Knit Your Soul to the Beloved</h3><blockquote>
<p>“Delight yourself also in the LORD, and He shall give you the desires of your heart.”<br>
— Psalm 37:4</p>
</blockquote><p>To manifest, you must do what Jonathan did: knit your soul to the beloved state before it appears. Support your David. Honour the promise within. Slay the inner giant of doubt with the stone of faith.</p><p>When your higher self aligns with the new identity and the old self steps aside, your manifestation becomes not just possible but certain.</p><blockquote>
<p>“And the LORD was with David…”<br>
— 1 Samuel 18:14</p>
</blockquote><p>So too is the Lord—your I AM—with anyone who dares to claim the end as already true.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
