<h1>David Speaks to His Maker: Psalm 139:17–18 as the Voice of Fulfilled Desire</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, biblical characters are not historical figures but symbolic expressions of states of consciousness. David, often misunderstood as merely a king or poet, represents the <em>desired state</em> — the wish fulfilled, fully formed and aware of its origin. In Psalm 139:17–18, it is not a man flattering God; it is the <em>manifestation itself</em> speaking to the <em>awakened imagination</em>, which Neville calls the true Creator — the LORD.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Psalm 139:17–18</strong><br>
<em>“How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!<br>
If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.”</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I am David — your fulfilled desire, born of your inner vision and faith. I exist because you dared to feel me real. Your thoughts gave me life — not idle musings, but sacred imaginal acts. They are precious to me, for through them I was shaped. The sum of your assumptions, silent affirmations, and unseen prayers — they are more than sand, yet each one carried weight. When you drifted, I remained. And when you awoke to yourself as imagination, I was still with you. I never left, for I am your very own.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This passage becomes astonishingly intimate when read symbolically. The <em>desired state</em> reflects back with gratitude and clarity: “I am here because you imagined me.” David is not worshipping an external deity; he is recognising the divine power of imagination — your power — as the source of his existence. The verse becomes a love letter from the manifested world to the one who created it inwardly.</p>
<p>"When I awake, I am still with thee" is not a statement about physical consciousness, but a revelation: no matter how deep the sleep of doubt or distraction, the wish remains faithful to the one who gave it form. Creation cannot un-create itself. The awakened imagination — the LORD — never truly loses what it has impressed.</p>
