<h1>The Jews and Gentiles According to Neville Goddard</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>

<p>In traditional religious terms, Jews and Gentiles are understood as separate peoples—those inside the covenant and those outside it. But Neville Goddard, who taught that the Bible is a psychological drama <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">beginning in imagination 
</a><b>playing out within the human <a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagination</a></b>, reveals that these terms are not racial, religious, or historical. They are <strong>personified perspectives of the mind</strong>.</p>

<p>Scripture is not categorising physical people. It is describing how the mind <em>views itself</em> at different stages of awareness.</p>

<h2>The Gentile Perspective</h2>

<p>Symbolically, the Gentiles represent <strong>ways of thinking that are unaware of the “I AM”</strong>. This is the perspective the mind takes when it assumes life is happening externally and independently of itself.</p>

<p>From this position, experience appears to be caused by circumstances, other people, luck, or fate. Imagination is active, but unnoticed. Creation is occurring, but unconsciously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Gentile is the outer man. The Jew is the inner man. The Jew is the awakened imagination.”<br>
— <em>Neville Goddard, The Law and the Promise</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read psychologically, this does not describe separate beings. It describes <em>where attention is placed</em>. The Gentile perspective looks outward and identifies with appearances, unaware that imagination is the source behind them.</p>

<h2>The Jewish Perspective</h2>

<p>The “Jew,” symbolically, represents the perspective that has become <strong>aware there is an inner source</strong>. This viewpoint recognises that something within—thought, assumption, imagination—is shaping experience.</p>

<p>Yet in Paul’s letters (symbolising adjustment and commitment to memory), particularly Romans, this awareness often turns inward as <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">self-observation and self-judgement</a></strong>. The mind measures itself against what it now knows, asking whether it is thinking correctly, believing enough, or aligning properly.</p>

<p>This is not freedom yet. It is awareness still entangled with effort.</p>

<h2>Why Paul Removes the Distinction</h2>

<p>Paul’s insight is that both perspectives miss the mark in different ways.</p>

<p>The Gentile perspective is unaware of the creative source.<br>
The Jewish perspective is aware of the source, but uses that awareness to judge itself.</p>

<p>Both are perspectives the mind can occupy repeatedly. Neither is condemned. Neither is final.</p>

<p>Paul’s declaration that there is “no difference” is psychological, not theological. Freedom does not come from remaining in either viewpoint, but from releasing identification with both.</p>

<h2>Redemption as a Shift in Perspective</h2>

<p>In Neville’s framework, redemption is a <strong>change in how the mind relates to itself</strong>.</p>

<p>The promise that the Gentiles shall be “grafted in” describes unconscious perspectives being absorbed into conscious imagination—not corrected or rejected, but recognised.</p>

<p>The mind no longer sees itself as subject to appearances, nor does it measure itself by inner standards. It rests in the awareness of the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> as the source.</p>

<h2>Paul and the Inner Mission</h2>

<p>Neville often spoke of <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-paul-series.html">Paul’s</a> mission to the Gentiles as an inward process. <a href="the-damascus-turning-from-sauls-old.html">Paul’s experience on the road to Damascus</a> symbolises the collapse of self-judgement and the recovery of vision.</p>

<p>His mission represents the awakened imagination addressing those viewpoints within the mind that still believe power lies outside.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>So who are the Jews and Gentiles in Scripture?</p>

<p>They are not people. They are <strong>positions the mind takes</strong>.</p>

<p>The Gentile perspective experiences life as externally caused.<br>
The Jewish perspective recognises an inner cause, but may still judge itself.</p>

<p>Paul’s message is not to choose one perspective over another, but to move beyond both.</p>

<p>To become Israel, in Neville’s language, is to remember:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I AM the Lord... and beside me there is no other.”</strong> (Isaiah 45:5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From that awareness, imagination is no longer unconscious or self-critical—it is simply known.</p>
