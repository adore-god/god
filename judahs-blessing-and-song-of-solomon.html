<h1>Jacob's Blessing Over Judah and the Song of Solomon</h1>
<blockquote><p><strong>"Judah, your brothers will give you praise: your hand will be on the neck of your haters; your father's sons will go down to the earth before you.</strong><br/>
<strong>Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, you have gone up: he has bent down and gone to rest like a lion, and like a lioness; who will make him get up?</strong><br/>
<strong>The rod of authority will not be taken from Judah, and the ruler's rod from between his feet, till he comes to Shiloh; and the peoples will put themselves under his rule.</strong><br/>
<strong>Knotting his ass to the vine, and his ass's foal to the best vine; washing his robe in wine, and his clothing in the blood of grapes:</strong><br/>
<strong>His eyes will be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk."</strong><br/>
— Genesis 49:8–12 (BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>Jacob’s blessing over Judah is full of rich symbolism: the lion’s strength, the royal sceptre, the vineyard, and the wine. These images echo powerfully in the Song of Solomon, which also uses lush, sensual language to express love and desire.</p><p>Through Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption, these symbols show us how to bring our desires to life: by fully embodying the feeling of fulfilment, as if it is already true.</p><h3>The Lion, the Sceptre, and the Vine</h3><p>Judah is called a lion’s cub and promised a sceptre — the symbol of ruling authority. This strength is not cold or distant; it is closely linked to the imagery of vineyards and wine, symbols of life, sweetness, and abundance.</p><p>The Song of Solomon uses similar language: the beloved’s lips drip honey, her cheeks are fragrant, and her eyes are gentle pools. These are more than poetic details — they represent the imagination’s creative power, the inner garden where desires grow and ripen.</p><h3>Eyes Like Wine, Teeth Like Milk</h3><p>Genesis 49:12 describes Judah’s eyes as red with wine and his teeth white with milk. The Song of Solomon repeats this type of imagery, inviting us to involve all the senses in our assumptions.</p><p>Neville taught that to manifest, you must feel your desire as real in a full, sensory way. Wine and milk symbolise this rich, sweet, lived-in feeling that impresses the subconscious mind.</p><h3>The Lineage: Possess, Beloved, Peace</h3><p>Judah’s line gives us a symbolic map:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesse</strong>, meaning “I possess,” shows that we must first claim the feeling of our desire as ours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong>, meaning “beloved,” stands for embodying this cherished state confidently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solomon</strong>, meaning “peace,” represents the rest and calm assurance that the manifestation is done.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These names outline the Law of Assumption in three steps: possess, embody, and rest.</p><h3>Embodying Judah’s Blessing</h3><p>Judah’s blessing and the Song of Solomon’s language invite us to take on our creative power with strength, beauty, and love. To live by Neville’s Law of Assumption is to be like Judah — ruling with imagination’s sceptre, tasting the sweet wine of fulfilled desire, and engaging all senses in the feeling of already being.</p><p>When we do this, our inner world and outer reality align, and what we desire naturally takes form.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-animals-series.html">Animals Series</a> | <a href="label-jacob-s-twelve-son-s-and-tribes-series.html">Jacob's Twelve Son's and Tribes Series</a> | <a href="label-judah-s-blessing-series.html">Judah's Blessing Series</a> | <a href="label-praise-series.html">Praise Series</a></p>
