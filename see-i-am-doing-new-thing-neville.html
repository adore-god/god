<blockquote>"See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?
I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland." — <em>Isaiah 43:19 (NIV)</em></blockquote>
<p>There is something stirring about this verse. It whispers of hope, change, and divine renewal. On the surface, it’s a promise of deliverance to a weary people. But when we reflect on it through the spiritual insights of Neville Goddard, it becomes more than poetic reassurance—it becomes a creative formula.</p>
<p>Neville taught that Scripture is not history or prophecy, but a psychological drama unfolding within us. <a href="elohim-god.html">God, he said, is our own wonderful human imagination</a>. Every verse, every miracle, every promise is a reflection of what’s possible when we awaken to the creative power within.</p>
<p>So what is this “new thing” Isaiah speaks of?</p>
<p>It is the emergence of a <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">new state of consciousness—a new inner image, born from the act of imagining differently </a>. This is not wishful thinking. It’s a deliberate movement of the inner eye. Neville would say that when you dare to feel yourself to be what you long to be—<em>before</em> there is any external evidence—you are doing a new thing. You are forming a new picture within, and that picture begins to radiate through the outer world, reshaping it in time.</p>
<p><em>"Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?"</em><br/>
This question is not about seeing with the physical eyes. It’s a divine nudge, asking:<br/>
<strong>“Do you not recognise this activity within yourself? Can you not feel your imagination at work?”</strong><br/>
It is pointing us directly to the faculty that brings the “new thing” into being—<strong>imagination itself</strong>. Before the new life appears outwardly, it stirs as a new picture within. A new mood, a new tone, a new assumption. That subtle inner motion is the seed breaking through the soil.</p>
<p>Neville often said that imagination is spiritual sensation. It is how we see what is yet unseen, and how the unseen becomes seen. When we imagine lovingly, persistently, and with belief, the new picture grows strong roots. It begins to express itself through outer events, sometimes subtly, sometimes in dramatic turns—but always as a reflection of the inner image we held.</p>
<p>The wilderness and wasteland symbolise the barren places in our lives—those parts of us that feel dry, stuck, fruitless. But God (our imagination) promises to bring forth streams there. That means transformation is possible <em>anywhere</em>. There is no place too desolate, no mind too tormented, no past too heavy. The “new thing” springs up because we dared to imagine differently.</p>
<p>This verse, then, is not only an ancient promise—it is a spiritual technique.</p>
<p>Are you ready to perceive the activity of imagination within yourself?<br/>
Will you allow the new picture to spring up—even while the outer world still reflects the old?</p>
<p>Neville would urge you to turn within. To revise. To imagine lovingly. To assume the wish fulfilled.</p>
<p>Because the new thing is not coming <em>to</em> you.<br/>
It is coming <em>through</em> you—by way of the imagination.</p>
