<h1>What Witchcraft and Manifestation Have in Common (And Why the Bible Was Never Truly Against It)</h1>
<p>For many of us raised in traditional Christianity, the word <em>witchcraft</em> was stamped with fire and brimstone. It wasn’t just frowned upon—it was feared, condemned, and often quoted out of context with verses like <em>“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.”</em> But what if the Bible was never actually against the principle behind witchcraft? What if, at its core, the same power that fuels spells, intention-setting, and ritual is the very power Neville Goddard spent his life teaching about?</p>
<p>What if the real problem was never magic, but <strong>misunderstood imagination</strong>?</p>
<h3>The Power Behind Witchcraft Is the Power of Consciousness</h3>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that imagination is the creative force behind everything we experience. “Imagination,” he said, “is God in action.” That’s not metaphor. That’s literal. Every image, emotion, and assumption you persist in becomes your world. It’s the power behind prophecy, prayer, healing, and yes—what many call magic.</p>
<p>Witchcraft, at its best, is not about superstition or control. It’s about conscious creation. A ritual, a chant, a spell—these are nothing more than focused tools to harness the imagination and direct belief. When you strip away the fear-based interpretations, you begin to see: <em>there is no conflict between the Bible and true magical practice</em>. They both honour the same principle. The trouble comes when religion forgets this—and starts policing power instead of understanding it.</p>
<h3>A Funny Thing Happened (Twice)</h3>
<p>I didn’t always see this clearly. In fact, there were a couple of points in my life where I dramatically <em>threw away my witchcraft books</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, actually threw them away—twice.</p>
<p>Each time was under the intense pressure of my well-meaning but very devout mother, who took Deuteronomy more seriously than she took my curiosity. One occasion even involved a church bin, holy water, and me sheepishly trying to look repentant while wondering why I felt worse tossing them than I ever did reading them.</p>
<p>Even then, something in me knew: those books weren’t “evil.” They held mystery, symbolism, power. They felt alive. I didn’t have words for it at the time, but now I do: they resonated with <strong>imagination</strong>. With the same creative force Neville later described as the Christ within.</p>
<h3>The Bible Was Never Meant to Be Read Literally</h3>
<p>When the Bible condemns “witchcraft,” it’s not talking about conscious creation or honouring inner symbolism. It’s warning against misuse of power, manipulation, and unconscious living—just as it also condemns empty ritual in religion, or blind obedience to the law without understanding the spirit.</p>
<p>Neville never separated the spiritual from the magical. In fact, he fused them by showing that the <em>real magic</em> is belief. The power isn’t in the ritual itself, but in the <strong>intensity and clarity of imagination</strong> behind it. The witchcraft I was taught to fear was, in truth, an intuitive form of manifestation. It was people tapping into the same creative force that moves mountains, when believed in deeply.</p>
<h3>Reclaiming What Was Never the Enemy</h3>
<p>It’s time to reclaim that power—and the Bible too. Not as enemies of each other, but as different expressions of the same truth: <em>You are the operant power.</em> Whether you call it a spell, a prayer, or a mental diet, the core remains the same. Consciousness creates reality. That’s not heresy. That’s scripture. That’s Neville. And that’s the missing piece that fear tried to bury.</p>
<p>So if you’ve ever felt torn between your spiritual hunger and your interest in magic, manifestation, or the esoteric—know this: you’re not off-track. In fact, this feeling is captured in the story of <a href="tamah-judah-and-perez.html" target="_blank">Judah and Tamar</a>. You’re being called to see deeper. To stop apologising for your intuition. To stop hiding your imagination. Because what they once told you was dangerous… might actually be divine.</p>
