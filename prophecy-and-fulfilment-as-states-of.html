<h1>Isaiah and John: Dialogue Similarities</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The Gospel of John is often described as the most mystical of the <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">four</a>, filled with imagery and symbolism that echo the prophecies of Isaiah. But these echoes are more than fulfilments of scripture&mdash;they represent inner states of consciousness, the &mdash; <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM &mdash;&nbsp;<i>unfolding through</i> imaginative realisation</a>. Drawing from Neville Goddard&rsquo;s teachings on the Law of Assumption, this comparison highlights key parallels between Isaiah and John not just as textual correspondences, but as stages in the spiritual awakening of the individual.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Forerunner: &ldquo;A voice crying in the wilderness&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>Isaiah 40:3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A voice cries: &lsquo;In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>John 1:23</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, &ldquo;Make straight the way of the Lord,&rdquo;&rsquo; as Isaiah the prophet said.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Textual Echo</strong>: John 1:23 quotes Isaiah 40:3 almost verbatim. The Greek verb (&kappa;&rho;ᾶ&zeta;&epsilon;&iota;) for &ldquo;crying out&rdquo; and the call to &ldquo;make straight the way&rdquo; are identical in both passages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Neville&rsquo;s Interpretation: Law of Assumption</h4>
<p>Under Neville Goddard&rsquo;s principle, &ldquo;living in the end&rdquo; begins with an inner declaration&mdash;&ldquo;a voice&rdquo;&mdash;that precedes outward manifestation. Here, the &ldquo;voice in the wilderness&rdquo; is the individual&rsquo;s awakened imagination, crying out against limiting beliefs (&ldquo;wilderness&rdquo;) and preparing the inner state for the assumed reality of fulfilment. The injunction to &ldquo;make straight the way&rdquo; signifies clearing internal pathways of doubt. When John 1:23 repeats Isaiah&rsquo;s words, it symbolises the internal alignment&mdash;two &ldquo;voices,&rdquo; Old Testament and New, converging on the same inner transformation.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Unheeded Servant: Hardening of Hearts</h2>
<h3>Isaiah 6:9&ndash;10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And he said, &lsquo;Go, and say to this people: &ldquo;Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.&rdquo;<br/>
Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn and be healed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>John 12:39&ndash;40</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said, &lsquo;He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Textual Echo</strong>: John 12:40 cites Isaiah 6:10 almost word-for-word. The Greek phrasing (&ldquo;&tau;ὴ&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&rho;&delta;ί&alpha;&nu; &tau;&omicron;ῦ &lambda;&alpha;&omicron;ῦ &tau;&omicron;ύ&tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &hellip; &tau;&upsilon;&phi;&lambda;&omicron;ῖ &alpha;ὐ&tau;ῶ&nu; &tau;ὰ ὦ&mu;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&rdquo;) mirrors Isaiah&rsquo;s summons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Neville&rsquo;s Interpretation: Law of Assumption</h4>
<p>Neville&rsquo;s teaching emphasises that every <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">visible effect has its root in an inner assumption</a>. &ldquo;Hardening of heart&rdquo; represents the unyielding assumption that prevents the individual from perceiving the imagined end. In Neville&rsquo;s terms, refusal to believe is refusal to assume the end is already accomplished. Isaiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;dull heart&rdquo; and &ldquo;blind eyes&rdquo; correspond to an unaltered subconscious assumption. When John 12:39&ndash;40 applies this, it shows that even obvious &ldquo;signs&rdquo; cannot penetrate a resistant assumption. Until one revises their <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-word-of-god-series.html">inner dialogue</a>&mdash;persistently imagining and feeling the desired end&mdash;these &ldquo;signs&rdquo; remain external and powerless.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Suffering Servant and the Crucifixion</h2>
<h3>Isaiah 53:7&ndash;9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.<br/>
By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people? And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>John 19:28&ndash;37</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus&rsquo; Silent Demeanour</strong>: Before Pilate and Herod, Jesus remains silent, &ldquo;opening not his mouth&rdquo; (cf. John 19:9&ndash;12; compare Matthew 27:12&ndash;14).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Piercing and No Bones Broken</strong> (John 19:34&ndash;36):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water.&hellip; For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: &lsquo;Not one of his bones will be broken.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/>
This alludes to Psalm 34:20, and Genesis 2:23 where Adam, recognises Eve as &ldquo;bone of my bones,&rdquo;. This illustrates the intimate unity between the imagination (the assumed state) and your conscious experience.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;They made his grave with the wicked and &hellip; with a rich man&rdquo;</strong> (Isaiah 53:9) is not quoted verbatim, but John <a href="the-assumption-of-jesus-rich-in.html">records Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy man</a>, providing his tomb (John 19:38&ndash;42).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Textual Echo</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Like a Lamb&rdquo;</strong>: John previously names Jesus &ldquo;the Lamb of God&rdquo; (John 1:29, 1:36). The crucifixion narrative&rsquo;s silent, sacrificial imagery aligns with Isaiah 53:7&ndash;8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Not One Bone Broken&rdquo;</strong>: John 19:36 explicitly connects this with Scripture&rsquo;s fulfilment (Psalm 34:20 in association with Isaiah 53). This symbolism was originally set in Genesis 2:23.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Rich Man&rsquo;s Tomb&rdquo;</strong>: Isaiah speaks of a &ldquo;rich man&rdquo; in the death scene; John describes Joseph of Arimathea&rsquo;s tomb.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interpretive Note</strong>: John&rsquo;s passion narrative assumes familiarity with Isaiah 53; these details confirm the match between prophecy and event.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Neville&rsquo;s Interpretation: Law of Assumption</h4>
<p>In Neville&rsquo;s framework, the &ldquo;Suffering Servant&rdquo; personifies the assumed fulfilled state in the imagination, which must be &ldquo;sacrificed&rdquo; to manifest outwardly. &ldquo;Opening not his mouth&rdquo; symbolises ceasing self-contradictory thoughts&mdash;replacing them with the assumption of victory. The pierced side (blood and water) metaphorically represents the inner flow of feeling and faith that follows true assumption. The &ldquo;rich man&rsquo;s tomb&rdquo; signifies the inner wealth of imagination entombing the old, limiting beliefs&mdash;laying them to rest so the new reality can emerge. Thus, these details instruct that to manifest, one must embody the assumption wholeheartedly, unmoved by external circumstances.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Light and Darkness Motif</h2>
<h3>Isaiah 9:2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>John 8:12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, &lsquo;I AM the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Textual Echo</strong>: Isaiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;people &hellip; in darkness &hellip; have seen a great light&rdquo; is not quoted verbatim, but John 8:12 closely parallels that imagery: &ldquo;light of the world &hellip; walk in darkness.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Neville&rsquo;s Interpretation: Law of Assumption</h4>
<p>Neville teaches that &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; reflects the untransformed state of consciousness&mdash;clouded by doubt&mdash;while the &ldquo;great light&rdquo; is the fully assumed end held in imagination. When Jesus declares &ldquo;<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> the light of the world,&rdquo; Neville would say this identifies with the imagined reality: to &ldquo;walk in the light of life&rdquo; means to persist in the mental attitude of the fulfilled desire. Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy of light shining details the process: hold the image of the end (light), allow that vibration to dispel inner darkness, and the outer world follows.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Voice from the Throne and the Messianic Reign</h2>
<h3>Isaiah 6:1&ndash;3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.<br/>
Above him stood the seraphim.&hellip; And one called to another and said: &lsquo;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>John 12:41</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Textual Echo</strong>: After quoting Isaiah 6:10 (hardening of hearts), John 12:41 notes that Isaiah &ldquo;saw his glory,&rdquo; indicating that the prophet&rsquo;s vision points ahead to the one now revealed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Neville&rsquo;s Interpretation: Law of Assumption</h4>
<p>For Neville, Isaiah&rsquo;s throne scene is an archetype of the inner consciousness fully assumed&mdash;&ldquo;high and lifted up.&rdquo; &ldquo;The train of his robe filled the temple&rdquo; symbolises the all-encompassing nature of an assumed reality: once one occupies that consciousness, it permeates every part of the mind (&ldquo;temple&rdquo;). When John says Isaiah &ldquo;saw his glory,&rdquo; it shows the prophet&rsquo;s experiential assumption&mdash;Isaiah beholds the inner kingdom. Neville would argue that anyone who &ldquo;sees&rdquo; and sustains that imagery is effectively enthroned in consciousness. Thus, John 12:41 portrays Jesus as the embodiment of that assumed glory; to live from that throne is to let the inner image become the outer reality.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Harvest and Gathering of the Gentiles</h2>
<h3>Isaiah 27:12&ndash;13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In that day the Lord will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt, and you, O people, will be gathered one by one, O children of Israel.<br/>
And in that day a great trumpet will be blown&hellip; and they will come, worship the Lord, and celebrate the feast of booths.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>John 12:20&ndash;21 (and implicit in 10:16)</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Greek &ldquo;Greeks&rdquo; Seeking Jesus (12:20&ndash;21):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, &lsquo;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And I have other sheep that are not of this fold&hellip;&rdquo; (10:16):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Textual Echo</strong> (thematic correspondence):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Gathered one by one&rdquo; (Isaiah 27:13)</strong> &harr; &ldquo;Greeks &hellip; came to Philip &hellip; wishing to see Jesus&rdquo; (John 12:20&ndash;21). &ldquo;In that day&rdquo; (Isaiah) signals an eschatological harvest; John signals this when outsiders seek Jesus, indicating an expansion beyond a single nation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;One flock, one shepherd&rdquo; (Isaiah&rsquo;s vision of unity)</strong> &harr; John 10:16&rsquo;s &ldquo;other sheep &hellip; one flock, one shepherd,&rdquo; indicating inclusion beyond the original fold.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Point</strong>: Though John never quotes Isaiah 27 directly, his narrative structure and emphasis on outsiders echo Isaiah&rsquo;s hope for a universal gathering.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Neville&rsquo;s Interpretation: Law of Assumption</h4>
<p>Neville teaches that &ldquo;in-gathering&rdquo; is the internal realisation that the assumed end already includes every aspect of desire. &ldquo;Threshing&rdquo; from &ldquo;Euphrates to Egypt&rdquo; symbolises separating limiting beliefs (chaff) from pure assumption (grain). When &ldquo;Greeks&rdquo; approach Jesus, it shows unfamiliar facets of the subconscious aligning with the new assumption. &ldquo;One flock, one shepherd&rdquo; signifies the unification of all thoughts under a single guiding assumption. To Neville, gathering &ldquo;one by one&rdquo; means mentally welcoming each suppressed desire into the assumed fulfilment. John&rsquo;s portrayal of Gentiles coming to Jesus thus depicts the unfolding inner harvest: every latent desire drawn into the sphere of the assumed reality.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>&ldquo;My House Shall Be Called a House of Prayer&rdquo; (Temple Imagery)</h2>
<h3>Isaiah 56:7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>John 2:16&ndash;17</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And to those who sold pigeons he said, &lsquo;Take these things away; do not make my Father&rsquo;s house a house of trade.&rsquo; His disciples remembered that it was written, &lsquo;Zeal for your house will consume me.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/>
(John 2:17 cites Psalm 69; yet, Isaiah 56:7&rsquo;s vision of an inclusive &ldquo;house of prayer&rdquo; resonates here.)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Textual Echo</strong>: John 2:17 explicitly recalls Psalm 69, but the larger context of Isaiah 56:7 (foreigners accepted into &ldquo;my house of prayer&rdquo;) is evoked by Jesus&rsquo; corrective action&mdash;removing commerce from a space intended for all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Neville&rsquo;s Interpretation: Law of Assumption</h4>
<p>In Neville&rsquo;s terms, the &ldquo;house of prayer&rdquo; is the mind&rsquo;s inner sanctuary where the assumed end is cultivated. &ldquo;All peoples&rdquo; denotes every aspect of the self&mdash;both conscious and subconscious&mdash;welcomed into the prayerful assumption. Jesus overturning tables symbolises clearing transactional, doubting thought-forms (&ldquo;trade&rdquo;) that obscure true imaginative prayer. Isaiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;holy mountain&rdquo; becomes the elevated state of consciousness when one assumes the end with unwavering faith. Neville would assert that to manifest, one must treat the inner temple as a &ldquo;house of prayer for all,&rdquo; meaning every thought and feeling aligns with the assumption. The cleansing process rejects discordant thoughts so the subconscious (&ldquo;altar&rdquo;) receives only the pure offering of the imagined fulfilment.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>&ldquo;Behold, your King is coming to you&rdquo; (Triumphal Entry)</h2>
<h3>Isaiah 62:11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth: &lsquo;Say to the daughter of Zion, &ldquo;Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>John 12:12&ndash;13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The next day&hellip; large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, &lsquo;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Textual Echo</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Isaiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Salvation comes; his reward is with him&rdquo; parallels the crowds&rsquo; cry &ldquo;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord&rdquo; (John 12:13).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though John does not quote Isaiah 62:11 verbatim, the language of arrival (&ldquo;he who comes&rdquo;) and the acclaim of a king evoke Isaiah&rsquo;s messianic announcement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Neville&rsquo;s Interpretation: Law of Assumption</h4>
<p>Neville teaches that &ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; means &ldquo;save now&rdquo; and represents the cry of the heart realising its own divine identity. Isaiah&rsquo;s proclamation to &ldquo;the end of the earth&rdquo; is the internal broadcast of the assumed reality across all levels of consciousness. When the crowd waves palms and cries &ldquo;Blessed is he who comes,&rdquo; it symbolises the inner reception of the presumed end&mdash;welcoming that assumed state into conscious awareness. The waving of palms also recalls Tamar&mdash;whose Hebrew name means &ldquo;palm tree&rdquo;&mdash;as an archetype of the receptive imagination, aligned with the bride imagery of Song of Solomon and Eden&rsquo;s garden. To Neville, every triumphant entry is an inner act of reception: one must mentally and emotionally acclaim the victory&mdash;&ldquo;Hosanna!&rdquo;&mdash;to manifest it outwardly. The &ldquo;daughter of Zion&rdquo; thus becomes the receptive faculty of the imagination, recognising that her &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; (the assumed fulfilled desire) has already arrived. John 12:12&ndash;13 is not only a historical event but a depiction of the inner reception required by the Law of Assumption.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>&ldquo;It Is Finished&rdquo; and the End of Sacrificial System</h2>
<h3>Isaiah 53:10&ndash;12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.<br/>
Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous; and he shall bear their iniquities.<br/>
Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>John 19:28&ndash;30</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfil the Scripture), &lsquo;I thirst.&rsquo; A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth.<br/>
When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, &lsquo;It is finished,&rsquo; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Textual Echo</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;To make his soul an offering for guilt&rdquo;</strong> (Isaiah 53:10) corresponds to &ldquo;I thirst&rdquo; and &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo; (John 19:28, 30). &ldquo;I thirst&rdquo; echoes Psalm 69:21, which forms part of the Suffering Servant milieu. &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo; (&tau;έ&tau;&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&iota;) signals the completion of that offering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Bearing the sin of many&rdquo;</strong> (Isaiah 53:12) is echoed in John&rsquo;s emphasis that Jesus&rsquo; final utterance completes the redemptive act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interpretive Note</strong>: John frames Jesus&rsquo; final words so that readers recognise Isaianic prophecy as fulfilled in both substance and form.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Neville&rsquo;s Interpretation: Law of Assumption</h4>
<p>Neville teaches that the final utterance &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo; represents the completion of inner assumption&mdash;when imagination has perfectly embodied the end result, requiring no further mental effort. &ldquo;I thirst,&rdquo; linked to Psalm 69, signals the climax of desire fully satisfied. Isaiah&rsquo;s servant &ldquo;making an offering for guilt&rdquo; describes the process of offering up all contrary thoughts (doubt, guilt) so that the only remaining assumption is the end. When Neville says, &ldquo;Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled,&rdquo; that inner realisation corresponds precisely to &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo; The external sacrificial system ends because the true act of offering lies within the mind&rsquo;s surrender of all opposing beliefs. John 19:28&ndash;30, through Neville&rsquo;s lens, reveals that the outer declaration of completion mirrors the inner completion of assumption&mdash;when the individual fully occupies the mental state of the desired reality, the world inevitably reflects that state.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah 6:9&ndash;10 &rarr; John 12:39&ndash;40</strong></p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He Saw His Glory (Throne Vision)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah 6:1&ndash;3 &rarr; John 12:41</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville</strong>: The enthroned Lord is the consciousness seated in the assumed fulfilled state; the train filling the temple is the pervasive nature of that assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gentile Inclusion (Harvest, One Flock)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah 27:12&ndash;13 &rarr; John 12:20&ndash;21; John 10:16</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville</strong>: Harvest signifies separating limiting beliefs from true assumption; &ldquo;one flock&rdquo; unifies all thought-forms under the assumed end.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>House of Prayer (Temple Cleansing)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah 56:7 &rarr; John 2:13&ndash;17</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville</strong>: Temple is the mind; &ldquo;house of prayer for all peoples&rdquo; is the receptive imagination; cleansing is removing contradictory thoughts so only the assumed end remains.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Triumphal Entry (&ldquo;He Who Comes&rdquo;)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah 62:11 &rarr; John 12:12&ndash;13</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville</strong>: &ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; is the acclaim of internal victory; palm branches (Tamar as palm) recall the bride&rsquo;s readiness; &ldquo;daughter of Zion&rdquo; recognises her salvation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It Is Finished (Sacrificial Completion)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah 53:10&ndash;12 &rarr; John 19:28&ndash;30</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville</strong>: &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo; is the inner certainty of desire fulfilled; &ldquo;I thirst&rdquo; signals the peak of desire now satisfied; external sacrifices cease once inner assumption is complete.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h4>Concluding Reflections with Neville&rsquo;s Lens</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Deliberate Fulfilment</strong>: John weaves Isaianic prophecy to show that Jesus&rsquo; &ldquo;signs and wonders&rdquo; are the outward expressions of fulfilled inner assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Symbolic Continuity</strong>: Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecies concern both external deliverance and inner transformation. John&rsquo;s Gospel, through Neville&rsquo;s lens, reveals that every &ldquo;sign&rdquo; is a symbolic act of imagination made manifest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inner Realisation</strong>: Isaiah&rsquo;s calls for awakened hearts and opened eyes parallel Neville&rsquo;s call to live in the end. John&rsquo;s emphasis on belief, spiritual sight, and hearing corresponds to Neville&rsquo;s insistence that &ldquo;faith&rdquo; is persistent inner assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By preserving every quotation and textual echo, and ensuring each paragraph is interpreted according to Neville&rsquo;s Law of Assumption, this analysis remains complete&mdash;showing how Isaiah&rsquo;s prophetic fabric is fulfilled in John as a profound teaching on consciousness, inviting the reader to assume and embody the reality behind each &ldquo;sign and wonder.&rdquo;</p><div class="share-dropdown">
