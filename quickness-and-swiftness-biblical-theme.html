<h1>Quickness and Swiftness: A Biblical Theme of Divine Movement and Neville Goddard’s Inner Union</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

    Swiftness in the Bible is more than mere speed. It’s a profound symbol of spiritual readiness, inner transformation, and the rapid manifestation of assumed realities. Neville Goddard emphasised that the moment we fully assume a state in imagination, manifestation follows without delay.<div><br/></div><div><img border="0" data-original-height="347" data-original-width="400" height="174" src="images/1748249939596%20(1).jpg" width="200"/></div><br/><div><p>More than just speed, the Bible teaches a vital truth: a <strong>swiftness in asserting the ‘I AM’—a continuous, forward-moving union with new, fresh, loving states of being</strong>. This swift movement in consciousness keeps imagination free from stagnation or negative entanglements, allowing manifestation to flow effortlessly.</p><p>This divine quickness pulses through the entire Bible—from prophetic narratives and psalms to the poetry of the Song of Solomon, the architecture of Solomon’s Temple, and the soaring visions of the prophets.</p><hr/><h2>1. The Speed of Inner Obedience and Faith</h2><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Abraham</strong> rose early and moved swiftly to obey God’s call (Genesis 22:3), reflecting immediate inner alignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong>, confident in his inner vision, runs quickly to meet Goliath (1 Samuel 17:48), embodying the swiftness of faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus’</strong> miracles happen <em>immediately</em> upon belief (Mark’s Gospel repeatedly uses “immediately” or <em>eutheōs</em>), illustrating Neville’s idea that inner conviction moves reality instantly.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr/><h2>2. The Divine Wind and Whirlwind: Prophetic Speed</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>“He makes His angels winds” (Psalm 104:4) and the <strong>whirlwinds</strong> of Ezekiel’s chariot (Ezekiel 1) symbolise the rapid and powerful movement of spiritual truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joel’s locust army (Joel 2) is described with <em>swift, coordinated motion</em>, a picture of imagination unleashed.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville would say this is the subconscious mind moving at its fastest once fully impressed by a new belief.</p><hr/><h2>3. Boaz: The Pillar of Strength and Swiftness</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>Among the two famous pillars of Solomon’s Temple, <strong>Boaz</strong> is interpreted as <strong>“fleetness”</strong> or <strong>“in him is swiftness.”</strong> This pillar represents <strong>dynamic readiness</strong>, the ability to act with <strong>power and quickness</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its counterpart, <strong>Jachin</strong>, means “He will establish,” symbolising stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together, they embody the balance of <strong>steady establishment and swift action</strong>—a perfect metaphor for Neville’s teaching: first establish the state in imagination, then watch manifestation rush in.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr/><h2>4. Song of Solomon: The Beloved’s Nimble Quickness</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Behold, he standeth behind our wall…showing himself through the lattice</strong>” (Song 2:9). The Beloved is ever-present yet hidden—like our desired state, always near, awaiting recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>My beloved is like a roe or a young hart…</strong>” (Song 2:9). The roe epitomises <strong>nimble swiftness</strong>, ready to appear the moment you call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>He cometh leaping upon the mountains…</strong>” (Song 2:8). Joyful, rapid movement towards union.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Make haste, my beloved…</strong>” (Song 8:14). An urgent plea for <strong>no delay</strong> in spiritual union.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For Neville, the Song is a mystical allegory of self (the soul) and imagination (the Beloved)—once assumed, fulfilment bounds toward you.</p><hr/><h2>5. The Quickening of the Spirit</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>Paul’s phrase “<strong>quickened together with Christ</strong>” (Ephesians 2:5 KJV) speaks of being <em>made alive</em>—an instantaneous awakening from doubt into faith.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville’s <em>I AM</em> teaching captures this: the moment you claim your state as real, you are spiritually “quickened,” and the outer world begins to echo that new life.</p><hr/><h2>6. Eagles and the Deer: Poetic Images of Swift Renewal</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>“<strong>They that wait upon the Lord shall mount up with wings as eagles</strong>” (Isaiah 40:31). The eagle’s soaring flight symbolises the soul’s rapid uplift when sustained by belief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>He makes my feet like hinds’ feet…to walk upon mine high places</strong>” (Habakkuk 3:19). The deer’s sure-footed, swift leap over obstacles mirrors how imagination carries us effortlessly over resistance.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To Neville, these images portray the body and circumstances rising quickly to meet the inner conviction of the new state.</p><hr/><h2>7. Elijah’s Whirlwind Ascent: The Swift Exit</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>“And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven” (2 Kings 2:11). The prophet’s sudden, whirlwind departure illustrates the <strong>instantaneous transition</strong> from one state to another when the inner vision is complete.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville would liken this to the moment of full assumption: the old self is left behind in a flash, and the new reality takes you up in its swift current.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion: The Dance of Divine Speed and Inner Conviction</h2><p>From Abraham’s obedience and David’s confident run to Jesus’ instantaneous healings, from the whirlwind angels to the beloved leaping in the Song of Solomon, the pillar of <strong>Boaz</strong>, the soaring eagle, the nimble hind, and Elijah’s ascent—the Bible repeatedly shows:</p><p><strong>When the inner man is ready, manifestation follows with joyous and effortless speed.</strong></p><p>More deeply, the Bible appears to teach a <strong>swiftness in asserting the ‘I AM’—a continuous, forward-moving union with new, fresh, loving states of being</strong>. This swift, unwavering movement in consciousness prevents the imagination from stagnating or becoming entangled in negative thoughts or doubt.</p><p>Neville Goddard’s teaching beautifully echoes this: to move swiftly and confidently in <em>I AM</em>—claiming and living as the desired state—so that your manifestations arise naturally and without delay.</p></div><div class="share-dropdown">
