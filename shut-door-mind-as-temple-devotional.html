<h1>Devotional: to Increase Faith</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The Bible is not a history book, but a map of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>. In its verses lie hidden instructions for inner transformation. Again and again, it calls you inward—to shut the door on appearances, to withdraw from the noise of the world, and to dwell in the holy place of imagination.</p><p>
The temple is not made with hands. It is your own mind, sanctified by the awareness of “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” (Exodus 3:14).</p>
<p>Below are twelve verses, each paired with a simple interpretation that reveals the deeper call: to live from within.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 6:6</strong><br>
</p><blockquote>But when you make your prayer, go into your private room, and shutting the door, say a prayer to your Father in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will give you your reward.</blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Shut out the senses. Withdraw into the silence of your imagination. The secret act of assuming the wish fulfilled is the true prayer.<p></p>

<p><strong>1 Corinthians 3:16</strong><br></p><blockquote>Do you not see that you are God’s holy house, and that the Spirit of God has his place in you?</blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Your mind is the true sanctuary. God—the creative power—is not outside you, but dwells within your awareness.<p></p>

<p><strong>Proverbs 4:23</strong><br>
</p><blockquote>Keep your heart with all care; for out of it come the sources of life.</blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Your inner feeling is the fountain of your world. Guard it. What you dwell upon becomes your life.<p></p>

<p><strong>Romans 12:2</strong><br>
</p><blockquote>And let not your behaviour be like that of this world, but be changed and made new in mind, so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of God.</blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
The world is your shadow. Change your inner assumptions and the world must follow. Renewal begins in imagination.<p></p>

<p><strong>Psalm 46:10</strong><br>
</p><blockquote>Be at peace in the knowledge that I am God: I will be lifted up among the nations, I will be honoured through all the earth.</blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Still the mental chatter. Feel “I AM” in quiet confidence. That awareness is God.<p></p>

<p><strong>Luke 17:21</strong><br>
</p><blockquote>And men will not say, See, it is here! or, There! for the kingdom of God is among you.</blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Don't look outside for your salvation. The kingdom—the state you desire to occupy—is within your own consciousness.<p></p>

<p><strong>2 Corinthians 6:16</strong><br>
</p><blockquote>And what agreement is there between a house of God and images? for we are a house of the living God; as God said, I will make my living-place among them, and go among them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.</blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
You are the dwelling of the creative force. Your every mood, belief, and assumption is where God walks.<p></p>

<p><strong>Isaiah 26:3</strong><br>
</p><blockquote>The man whose heart is unmoved you will keep in peace, because his hope is in you.</blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Peace is the fruit of faith. Dwell inwardly in the feeling of your wish fulfilled, and the outer will harmonise.<p></p>

<p><strong>Mark 4:24</strong><br>
</p><blockquote>Take care what you give ear to: the measure you give will be the measure you get, and more will be given to you.</blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
What you accept as true within determines what is returned to you. The world reflects your inner measure.<p></p>

<p><strong>Philippians 4:8</strong><br>
</p><blockquote>...whatever things are true, serious, right, clean, pleasing, and of good name... keep your thoughts on these things.</blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Discipline your attention. Imagination fed on truth and beauty becomes the womb of your better world.<p></p>

<p><strong>Ephesians 4:23–24</strong><br>
</p><blockquote>Be made new in the spirit of your mind; and put on the new man, to which God has given life, in righteousness and a true and holy way<i>.</i></blockquote>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Your identity is chosen. Assume the feeling of the new man. That state, once worn, brings its own evidence.<p></p>

<p><strong>Colossians 3:2–3</strong><br>
<em>Keep your mind on the higher things, not on the things of earth. For your life is gone, and is now hidden with Christ in God.</em><br>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Detach from appearances. Your true life—the fulfilled version of yourself—exists now in the unseen. Claim it inwardly.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
