<h1>Esau and Jacob: Isaac's Blessing</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Before we enter the story of Jacob and Esau, it is important to understand why the rest of the Bible and the story of Jesus are necessary, even when <strong>feeling is the secret</strong>. Feeling alone initiates creation, but the Scriptures provide the orderly demonstration of how feeling manifests reality. They show the steps, the progression, and the precise cultivation of consciousness needed to live fully in the state you wish to embody. Jesus’ life, crucifixion, and resurrection represent the ultimate enactment of the Law of Assumption, revealing the full power of inner feeling made external.</p>

<p>The story of <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Jacob</a> receiving Isaac’s blessing is not about trickery in any moral sense. It is a symbolic parable — a teaching story. At its centre is the message: <strong>You <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">become what you assume</a>, and feeling is the secret that brings it into being.</strong> The blessing belongs to the one who <strong>steps into the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">identity</a> with conviction and feeling</strong>, not the one who claims it by birth.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Isaac: The Law of Assumption and Feeling</h3>
<p>Isaac is the <strong>child of promise</strong> (Galatians 4:23) — the embodiment of faith and inner conviction. He represents the Law of Assumption in action, recognising and blessing the state that has been assumed. Crucially, it is the <strong>felt reality</strong> of the one presenting themselves that secures the blessing.</p>
<p>Within Isaac dwell two sons — two states of being. <strong>Esau</strong> represents the outer, reactive self, tied to sensation and habit. <strong>Jacob</strong> is the inner, imaginative self — the one who assumes the state through <strong>feeling and inner knowing</strong>. Isaac’s blessing goes not to birthright or effort, but to the living enactment of assumed feeling.</p>

<hr>
<h3>The Birthright and the Hunger for Spiritual Inheritance</h3>
<p>Esau sells his birthright for fleeting satisfaction (Genesis 25:29–34). Desire alone is not enough; it must be paired with <strong>felt experience of the assumed state</strong>. Jacob hungers for the spiritual inheritance and claims it — not through force, but by internalising and living the feeling of already having it. The Bible continually demonstrates that the feeling must be sustained and disciplined to bear fruit.</p>

<hr>
<h3>The Act of Clothing: Identity Assumed and Felt</h3>
<p>Jacob dons Esau’s garments and covers himself with goatskin. Clothing in the Bible symbolises the <strong><a href="genesis-111-seed.html">outer expression of an inner state</a></strong>. Jacob does not become Esau by deception alone — he becomes him through <strong>imaginative feeling</strong>. The Law of Assumption operates fully when the <strong>inner sensation of already being</strong> aligns with outward presentation. This is the precise method demonstrated throughout Scripture: to feel oneself into the end before the world confirms it.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Not Annihilation, But Replacement by Assumption and Feeling</h3>
<p>Jacob does not destroy Esau but <strong>supplants him through assumed feeling</strong>. One state of consciousness overtakes another not by force but by the intensity of inner experience, which Neville Goddard calls the secret: <strong>feeling is the bridge from imagination to reality.</strong> The stories of the Bible, including Jesus, serve to train the mind to maintain that feeling consistently until manifestation occurs.</p>

<hr>
<h3>The Blessing Given: The Moment of Felt Choice</h3>
<blockquote><p><em>“The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”</em> — Genesis 27:22</p></blockquote>
<p>Isaac discerns the fusion of imagination and physical sensation. Jacob’s inner identity (voice) is united with outward appearance (hands). It is <strong>the felt reality of Jacob’s assumption</strong> that secures the blessing. Esau, arriving later, lacks the inner feeling and is too late.</p>

<hr>
<h3>The Fulfilment of Genesis 1:26 through Feeling</h3>
<blockquote><p><em>“Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The likeness is not simply received; it is <strong>assumed and felt</strong>. Man becomes what he presents himself as, through the living experience of inner conviction and sensation made real. The Bible demonstrates repeatedly how this principle is enacted over time, culminating in the life of Jesus.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Paul’s Echo: Putting on the New Man through Feeling</h3>
<blockquote><p><em>“Putting on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.”</em> — Ephesians 4:24</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>“Putting off the old man… and being renewed in the spirit of your mind.”</em> — Ephesians 4:22–24</p></blockquote>
<p>Jacob’s donning of Esau’s garments enacts this principle. The <strong>felt readiness</strong> to live as the desired person precedes external confirmation. This is the secret: you must <strong>feel yourself into the state</strong> you wish to manifest. The rest of Scripture, and especially Jesus, shows the ultimate expression of sustained feeling brought to fulfilment.</p>

<hr>
<h3>The Blessing Belongs to the One Who Assumes and Feels</h3>
<p>This story is not deceit but spiritual instruction. The outer man (Esau) represents reactive habit; the inner man (Jacob) represents imaginative assumption <strong>fused with feeling</strong>. The daring message:</p>
<p><strong>You do not receive the blessing by waiting —<br>
You <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">receive it by assuming the identity and feeling yourself into it</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s words: <strong>“Feeling is the Secret.”</strong> The one who dares to live in the sensation of fulfilled desire will always hear:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Surely, he shall be blessed.”</em></p></blockquote>
