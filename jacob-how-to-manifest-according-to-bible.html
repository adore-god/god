<h1>Jacob:  Wrestling with a New Identity</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In <strong>Genesis 32</strong>, Jacob wrestles through the night with “<a href="genesis-126-man.html">a man</a>” until the break of day. At face value, it’s a strange and gripping encounter—one that results in Jacob’s name being <a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">changed to <strong>Israel</strong></a>, meaning <em>“he who struggles with God.”</em> But this is not a tale of physical combat. It’s a powerful symbolic story of the internal battle we each face when we decide to change the conception of ourselves.</p><hr><h2>The Man as the Ideal</h2><p>Neville Goddard often pointed out that biblical characters represent <strong>states of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a></strong>. In this light, “<a href="genesis-126-man.html">the man</a>” Jacob wrestles is not external — it is Jacob’s own <strong>higher ideal</strong>, the new <a href="genesis-126-man.html">self-conceived man</a> he desires to assume. This new self isn’t easy to grasp. It’s unfamiliar, elusive, and demands persistence to hold. The struggle Jacob undergoes is the psychological effort it takes to claim and sustain a new state of being.</p><p>Every time you <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">imagine a better version of yourself</a> — healthier, wealthier, more confident — you are, like Jacob, grabbing hold of a divine idea. But the old self doesn’t let go quietly. The doubts, the past patterns, the emotional inertia — all of it resists. That is the <strong>night of wrestling</strong>. The night when you decide to embody a new self-concept and must persist against every suggestion from within that says, <em>“You’re still Jacob.”</em></p><hr><h2>“I will not let you go unless you bless me.”</h2><p>This line from Jacob is the key to understanding what’s required to truly change. You must refuse to release the new ideal, no matter how dark the night or how long the struggle. That ideal — the man you're wrestling with — must bless you, must give you its name. That is, the new self must become your identity.</p><p>To be blessed by the ideal means <strong>to become it</strong>. But this only happens when you hold to it with unrelenting <strong>faith and determination</strong>.</p><hr><h2>The Limp as the Mark of Change</h2><p>The limp shows the strain of trying to maintain the vision of the newly perceived <b><a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a></b>, that isn’t yet fully embodied. It’s the faltering that comes with stretching the mind to accept a higher version of self — an identity that feels foreign at first.</p><hr><h2>Psalm 132:1-5 and the Power of Persistent Seeking</h2><p>Neville Goddard sheds further light on this theme in his interpretation of <strong>Psalm 132:1-5</strong>, which calls for earnest seeking and holding fast to the “place” where God’s presence is found:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Lord, remember David, and all his affliction;<br>
How he swore unto the Lord, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;<br>
Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;<br>
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids,<br>
Until I find out a place for the Lord, a habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville explains that this “place for the Lord” is the <strong>inner mental state</strong> or <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> where the divine presence — your ideal self — can dwell. Just as <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-david-series.html">David</a> vowed to seek this place without rest or sleep, the seeker of transformation must persist tirelessly in imagination, refusing to surrender until the new self is fully realised within.</p><p>This relentless seeking mirrors Jacob’s night-long wrestling. It is the refusal to accept anything less than the full embodiment of the new identity — the “habitation” where your ideal being can rest and abide. Neville reminds us that spiritual transformation is not passive; it requires the same determined, sleepless resolve David promises in Psalm 132.</p><hr><h2>Becoming Israel</h2><p>Jacob’s name change to <a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel</a> marks the moment he mentally overcomes the old self. “Jacob” means supplanter — the one who grasps, struggles, and schemes. But after wrestling with the formation in consciousness of a new "<a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>",  and refusing to let go until he receives a blessing, he is renamed “Israel,” meaning “he who rules as God” or “God prevails.”</p><p>To become <a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel</a> means to become one who persists in claiming a newly formed perception of<b> self</b>, even when everything in the world denies it. It is the moment the imagined state is no longer a wish, but a truth you have become.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
