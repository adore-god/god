<h1>Son of Man vs. Son of God: What Do These Titles Really Mean?</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><p><em>"Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.”</em></p><blockquote><p>
— <em>Ezekiel 2:1</em></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p><em></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Book of Ezekiel is filled with prophetic visions, symbolic encounters, and one repeated phrase: <strong>Son of Man</strong>. This title appears more than <strong>ninety times</strong> in Ezekiel, and yet—surprisingly—it is also the most common way <strong>Jesus refers to Himself</strong> in the New Testament.</p>
<p>How can this be?</p>
<p>According to <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, there is no contradiction here at all. In fact, the shared title reveals something profound:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Bible is not a history book—it is the spiritual autobiography of every individual.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2><strong>From Genesis to Revelation: The Evolution of Awareness</strong></h2>
<p>Neville teaches that the Bible is a continuous narrative—not of world events, but of the <strong>inner evolution of consciousness</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We begin in Genesis in <strong>unconscious perfection</strong>, symbolised by the Garden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then comes the <strong>fall into duality</strong>, the rise of tribes, kings, and prophets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each character is not a historical figure, but a <strong>state of consciousness</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From <strong>Adam</strong> to <strong>Noah</strong>, to <strong>Abraham</strong>, <strong>Moses</strong>, <strong>David</strong>, and finally <strong>Jesus</strong>, we move through the <strong>stages of awareness</strong> leading to spiritual awakening.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Jesus Christ is your own wonderful human imagination.”</em><br>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Who Is the Son of Man?</strong></h2>
<p>In Neville’s interpretation, <strong>the Son of Man is the awakened awareness of being</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s the moment you stop looking outside yourself for power and begin to recognise the <strong>divine voice within</strong>. When Ezekiel is addressed as <em>Son of Man</em>, it symbolises his entry into a new state—one in which he is ready to <strong>receive divine instruction directly</strong>.</p>
<p>He must “eat the scroll”—internalise truth. Just as Jesus later says, <em>“I and my Father are one.”</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Son of Man is not a man born 2,000 years ago, but the awakened imagination in every man.”</em><br>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Why Not Just Call Him ‘Son of God’?</strong></h2>
<p>Neville makes a clear distinction between the two titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Son of God</strong> = the <strong>eternal I AM</strong>, the divine spark, the <strong>original identity</strong> within every individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Son of Man</strong> = the <strong>process of awakening</strong>—that same divine spark <strong>coming into awareness within the world of form</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Son of God is your essence.<br>
The Son of Man is your realisation of it.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while the Son of God is who you have always been in truth, the Son of Man is who you become when you start to remember it.</p>
<p><strong>Ezekiel</strong> is in the process of awakening.<br>
<strong>Jesus</strong> is that process <strong>fully realised</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Why Do People Think 'Son of Man' Refers Exclusively to Jesus?</strong></h2>
<p>It’s a common misconception, but there are a few reasons for it:</p>
<h2>1. <strong>Jesus Uses the Title Repeatedly</strong></h2>
<p>In the Gospels, Jesus refers to Himself as “Son of Man” more than any other name:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.”</em> — Luke 19:10<br>
<em>“The Son of Man must suffer many things…”</em> — Mark 8:31</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2. <strong>Daniel’s Vision Adds a Mystical Weight</strong></h2>
<p>Daniel 7:13 describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“One like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven...”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was interpreted as a Messianic prophecy and became linked to Jesus by early theologians.</p>
<h2>3. <strong>Church Tradition Cemented the Dual Identity</strong></h2>
<p>Over time, Christian doctrine taught that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Son of Man</em> = Jesus's humanity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Son of God</em> = Jesus's divinity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This formalised a divide which Neville’s teachings seek to dissolve.</p>
<h2>4. <strong>Literal Readings Miss the Symbolic Pattern</strong></h2>
<p>If you read the Bible as historical record, you’ll see these titles as exclusive to individuals. But when you see it as <strong>symbolic</strong>—a map of spiritual evolution—you realise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Titles belong to states, not people.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Jesus: The Fulfilment of the Pattern</strong></h2>
<p>For Neville, <strong>Jesus is not merely a man</strong>, but a <strong>state of perfected imagination</strong>—the end of the inner journey. Every biblical figure that comes before Him is a <strong>shadow or prototype</strong> of that ultimate realisation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Jesus Christ is the personification of every man’s fulfilled desire.”</em><br>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ezekiel</strong>, then, is a bridge.<br>
A threshold figure.<br>
He is addressed as Son of Man because he is learning to listen—not to the outer world, but to the <strong>inner voice of God</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>What This Means for You</strong></h2>
<p>When God says to Ezekiel, <em>“Son of man, stand upon thy feet,”</em> He is saying the same thing to you.</p>
<p><strong>Awaken.</strong><br>
<strong>Stand in your imagination.</strong><br>
<strong>Take back your power.</strong></p>
<p>You are not a victim of the world around you. You are the one who imagines it.</p>
<p>Every title in Scripture belongs to you—when you step into the state it represents:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are <strong>Adam</strong> when you forget who you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are <strong>Moses</strong> when you lead yourself out of limiting beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are <strong>David</strong> when you face the giant of fear or circumstance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And you are <strong>Jesus</strong> when you awaken and declare, <em>“Before Abraham was, I AM.”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: The Title Is a Signpost</strong></h2>
<p>When Ezekiel is called <em>Son of Man</em>, it’s not an overlap—it’s a <strong>signpost</strong> in the journey of awakening. It shows us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible describes your own inner transformation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the title of <em>Son of Man</em> is not reserved for one man in history—it is a stage on the path to remembering that you are, and have always been, <strong>the Son of God</strong>.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
