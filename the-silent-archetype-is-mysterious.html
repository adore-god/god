<h1>Young Boys and Children </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p></p><blockquote><p>"But if anyone causes one of these <b><i>little ones</i></b> who have faith in me to be turned away from me, it would be better for him to have a great stone fixed to his neck, and to be sent down to the deep sea." — Matthew 18:6</p><p>"And he took a little child, and put him in the middle of them, And said, Truly I say to you, if you do not have a change of heart and become like <b><i>little children</i></b>, you will not go into the kingdom of heaven." — Matthew 18:2–5</p></blockquote><p>Throughout the Bible, we occasionally meet a nameless boy or young man who appears without context, without dialogue, and often without explanation. These figures slip into the narrative just long enough to carry out a task or witness a pivotal moment—then vanish.</p>
<p>At first glance, they seem incidental. But in light of symbolic interpretation—especially through the teachings of Neville Goddard—these silent figures may represent something far more powerful: <strong>the Benjamin archetype</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Benjamin: The Youngest, the Hidden, the Beloved</strong></h3>
<p>Benjamin is the youngest son of Jacob and Rachel, and the only full brother of Joseph. He is born into sorrow—his mother dies in childbirth—and yet his name means “Son of the Right Hand,” a title full of power, intimacy, and favour.</p>
<p>In symbolic terms, Benjamin represents the <strong>emerging new self</strong>—the delicate beginning of a transformation formed through desire and imagination. He is often silent in the narrative, and yet the drama turns around him: Joseph weeps at his presence, Judah pleads for his freedom, and the silver cup—the hidden assumption—is planted in his sack.</p>
<p>Benjamin is that <strong>inner self born of longing</strong>, the unspoken but essential part of us that carries the potential for real change.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Boy with Jonathan and David</strong></h3>
<p>In 1 Samuel 20, as Jonathan sends David away to protect him from Saul, he enlists a young boy to gather arrows. The boy does not understand the hidden meaning behind Jonathan’s actions, but he enacts them faithfully. He is the carrier of a message he doesn’t comprehend—<strong>an unconscious servant of love and destiny</strong>.</p>
<p>This boy is a Benjamin figure. He moves between two larger forces—Jonathan and David—just as Benjamin moves between Judah and Joseph. He is the <strong>silent link</strong> through which transition occurs. His very innocence and unawareness reflect how the subconscious acts: obediently, without reasoning, but with immense consequence.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Young Man Who Flees at Gethsemane</strong></h3>
<p>In the Gospel of Mark 14:51–52, during Jesus’s arrest, a young man wrapped in linen follows at a distance. When the soldiers grab him, he flees naked, leaving his garment behind. He appears out of nowhere—and is never named or mentioned again.</p>
<p>Who is he?</p>
<p>Again, we find a Benjamin-like figure: <strong>present at the turning point</strong>, yet wordless. His linen garment suggests something newly clothed—an identity still forming. But when fear strikes, he flees, abandoning the outer covering. Symbolically, this could represent the fragile, awakened self that is not yet fixed—<strong>an assumption not yet nailed to the cross</strong>, a state not yet made permanent.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Pattern of the Silent Self</strong></h3>
<p>These unnamed boys and young men share a striking pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They appear at <strong>transitional moments</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They act <strong>without understanding</strong>, yet their role is essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are <strong>silent, shadow-like presences</strong>, existing on the edge of great decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They embody a <strong>youthful, emerging energy</strong>—not fully developed, but charged with possibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And in this, they echo Benjamin: the <strong>embryonic self</strong>, the quiet container of breakthrough.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h3>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not history, but psychological truth. These boys are not just literary devices; they are <strong>symbols of your own inner life</strong>. They represent that part of you which is new, unformed, but deeply involved in transformation. When you dare to imagine a new state of being, Benjamin is born. When you carry an assumption that has not yet surfaced, the silver cup is in your sack. And when your subconscious acts without your full awareness, the boy gathers arrows or runs naked into the night.</p>
<p>These characters remind us that <strong>not every part of your transformation will be loud, clear, or even understood</strong>. Some changes happen silently, beneath the surface, through the most unassuming aspects of your being.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Recognising Your Inner Benjamin</strong></h3>
<p>In the stories of David and Jonathan, Joseph and his brothers, and even Jesus and the soldiers, the unnamed boy or young man walks the edge of greatness. He is not the one commanding, declaring, or explaining. But he is always <strong>in motion</strong>, always <strong>in service to something larger</strong>, and always symbolic of the <strong>delicate but essential part of you that carries assumption, transition, and emerging selfhood</strong>.</p>
<p>So next time you read of a nameless boy in scripture, don’t overlook him. He might just be <strong>your inner Benjamin</strong>, quietly carrying the seeds of everything you’re about to become.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
