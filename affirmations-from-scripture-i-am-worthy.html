</p><p class="" data-end="631" data-start="207">This collection of Bible-based affirmations is for the one who no longer begs, but believes — the one who knows that desire is sacred, and fulfilment is her birthright. Each verse, taken from the Bible in Basic English (BBE), has been gently shaped into a first-person declaration of truth. Speak them aloud. Whisper them in the quiet. Let them shape your inner world, for what you accept as true within will appear without</p><hr/><h2><strong>1. I am what I am.</strong></h2><blockquote>

</blockquote><h2><strong>7. I am not afraid — I am made perfect in love.</strong></h2><blockquote>
