<h1>Daniel: Lion and Beast</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p></p><p>According to Neville Goddard’s teachings, the Bible is not a historical account but a psychological drama, mapping out the inner journey of man. Every character and event symbolises states of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>, and transformation begins the moment you <em>assume</em> a new state as true. Among these symbols, the lion and the beast reveal the inner dynamic between your assumed identity and your unawakened self.</p><h3>The Lion: Your Assumed State of Sovereignty</h3><p>The lion represents the state you must deliberately assume—the awakened imagination, fully aware of its creative power. This is the<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html"> I AMness</a>: <a href="the-lion-rules-domination-and-dominion.html">adoring, assertive, and sovereign</a>. When you assume this state, you no longer respond to appearances. You act from the knowing that your inner assumptions dictate your outer reality.</p><p>The lion is not something to become—it's a state to occupy. When you say “I am,” and feel it to be true, you embody the lion’s nature. This is not about effort, but about acceptance. You live as though what you desire is already so, and life conforms accordingly. Just as the lion reigns effortlessly, your world bends to the authority of your inner convictions.</p><h3>The Beast: The State of Forgotten Power</h3><p>The beast represents a state of being in which you’ve forgotten your creative authority. It is the <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">reactive mind—ruled by appearances, fears, and habitual patterns</a>. This is the egoic self that seeks proof before belief, that doubts, craves, and looks to the outer world for permission to feel fulfilled.</p><p>But even this state has purpose. It is not evil, only unconscious. Neville teaches that all states exist and you can move from one to another by assumption. The beast is simply the state of not assuming responsibility for your inner world. It reacts rather than creates.</p><h3>Nebuchadnezzar: A Journey of Assumption</h3><p>In Daniel 4, Nebuchadnezzar’s story is a perfect allegory of moving from <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">beast</a> nature to the <a href="the-lion-rules-domination-and-dominion.html">lion</a>. As king, he initially represents the ruling assumption—but it becomes corrupted by pride in external things. As a result, he falls into madness, living as a beast—a man who has forgotten his inner power.</p><p>Yet his descent into the beast is not a punishment—it is a phase. His return begins when he “raises his eyes toward heaven,” which symbolises a shift in awareness. He assumes a new state: recognition of the “Most High” within. And with that single act of inner alignment, his sanity—his right of assumption—is restored.</p><blockquote>
<p>“At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored.” —Daniel 4:34</p>
</blockquote><p>The seven years he spends in this fallen state represent the complete cycle of transformation. When the assumption is made—when the state is claimed—the outer world must respond. His throne is restored not because of repentance, but because of a change in consciousness.</p><h3>Integration: Using the Beast to Serve the Lion</h3><p>Even the beast has a role to play. Once the higher self (the assumed I AM) is recognised, the beast becomes a servant rather than a master. The emotions, instincts, and reactions that once dominated your experience are now tools—raw energy shaped by the direction of imagination.</p><p>This is not about suppressing the beast but commanding it. The lower nature, once governed by fear, now obeys the higher mind. The power that once created unwanted circumstances now serves the conscious creator.</p><h3>Your Journey: Assumption Is the Only Path</h3><p>You, too, will face times where you feel ruled by the beast—by worry, doubt, or a sense of being lost. But these are just indicators that you’ve slipped into an old state. You are never stuck. You are always free to assume a new identity.</p><p>Neville says, “Dare to assume you are what you want to be, and you will compel everyone to play their part.” Like Nebuchadnezzar, your return begins the moment you assume your sovereignty.</p><h3>Conclusion: Assume the Throne</h3><p>The battle between the lion and the beast is not a war—it’s a decision. The beast falls the moment you assume the I AM as your true identity. This is the essence of the Law of Assumption: everything begins and ends within your own consciousness.</p><p>You are not here to conquer the world—you are here to assume the state that creates it. Assume it now. Be still. Know I AM. And the world will mirror your conviction with perfect fidelity.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
