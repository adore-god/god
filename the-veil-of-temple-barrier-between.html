<h1>The Veil of Solomon's Temple: The Barrier Between Torn in Two</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<blockquote> 
We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain,
where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek." — Hebrews 6:19-20
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html">Solomon's temple</a>, a <strong>veil separated</strong> the <strong>Holy Place</strong> from the <strong>Holy of Holies</strong>. This wasn’t just a curtain—it symbolised the divide between the <strong>conscious mind</strong> (what we know) and the <strong>imaginative mind</strong> (the unknown creative source).</p><h2>Neville Goddard’s Insight</h2><p>Neville taught that this veil represents the <strong>doubt and limiting beliefs</strong> that block our imagination’s power and stop our desires from manifesting.</p><p>When Christ said,</p><blockquote>
<p>“<strong>The veil was torn in two</strong>” (Mark 15:38),</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville saw this as the <strong>removal of all doubt and resistance</strong>, letting our assumptions flow freely into manifestation.</p><h2>Conscious Mind &amp; Imaginative Mind</h2><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Holy Place = Conscious Mind</strong><br>
The space of awareness, logic, and outer action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Holy of Holies = Subconscious Mind</strong><br>
The hidden creative power, source of all manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The veil <strong>separates</strong> these two. The conscious mind must impress desires on the subconscious before they appear in reality.</p><h2>The Veil = Doubt and Limiting Beliefs</h2><p>Doubt acts like a veil. It blocks what the conscious mind wants from reaching the subconscious creative power.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>Mark 15:38</em><br>
“And the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This tearing symbolises <strong>breaking down that barrier</strong>. Now, what we assume consciously can directly influence our subconscious and manifest without delay.</p><h2>Jachin and Boaz: The Pillars of Creation</h2><p>At the temple entrance stood two pillars:</p><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Pillar</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
<th>Symbolises</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Jachin</strong></td>
<td>“He will establish”</td>
<td>The <strong>firm assumption</strong> of a new state—your conscious declaration of “I AM.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Boaz</strong></td>
<td>“In him is strength”</td>
<td>The <strong>strength and courage</strong> to hold and persist in that assumption.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>Both pillars are <strong>masculine symbols</strong>—representing the <strong>conscious mind’s power</strong> to establish and support creation.</p><blockquote>
<p>The subconscious is symbolised by <strong>feminine imagery</strong>—the womb, the bride, the earth—the receptive creative space.</p>
</blockquote><p>Before the veil is torn, these pillars struggle to impress their will on the subconscious. But once the veil is gone, conscious mind and imagination work as one.</p><h2>The Final Step: Removing Doubt</h2><p>Neville taught that <strong>complete removal of doubt</strong> is necessary for full manifestation.</p><blockquote>
<p>“<em>Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by works, is dead.</em>” — James 2:17</p>
</blockquote><p>Faith (Jachin) and strength (Boaz) must work together. When doubt is gone, manifestation flows naturally and effortlessly.</p><h2>The Inner Marriage</h2><p>This unity reflects the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">mental marriage</a> of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> and <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a> (Genesis 2:23–24):</p><blockquote>
<p>“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Conscious mind and imagination become <strong>one flesh</strong>—fully merged, creating a new reality effortlessly.</p><blockquote><p><em>Matthew 21:22</em><br>
“And all things, what ever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.”</p></blockquote><div class="share-dropdown">
