<h1>The Tower of Babel: A New Principal Language</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Following the great cleansing and renewal symbolised by <strong>Noah’s flood</strong> in Genesis 6–9 —which represents the clearing away of old, faulty assumptions and mental clutter—the gathering of thoughts in the mind called the children of men are faced with a choice: to continue building reality through <strong><a href="genesis-47-sin.html">toil, effort, and external labour</a>,</strong> or to fully focus on the law of Assumption</p><p>The "children of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">men</a>" symbolise the ordinary, ungoverned thoughts a person holds before they learn and apply the Law of Assumption. These thoughts are simple, reactive, and shaped by outer appearances rather than inner direction. Only when one begins to elevate their inner self-concept and assume new states do these scattered "children" transform into purposeful creations, reflecting the true creative power within. The children of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">men</a> are soon retitled <i><b><a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel</a></b></i>, and as the reader progresses, are ultimately addressed the '<b><i>church</i></b>' in Paul's letters.</p><hr><h3>The Children of Men Still Building the Old Way</h3><p>In the generations after Noah, awareness begins again to build, but this time, as Genesis 4:17-24 suggests, it is still with the old mindset:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Cain… built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This city-building represents <b>the old way of building reality through external effort and scattered thoughts </b><i>expressed as Cain</i>—the mind working without awareness in imagination. The 'children of men' are still striving through external means, caught in the cycle of cause and effect, toil and labour.</p><hr><h3>The Tower of Babel: Confusion and the Introduction of the Law of Assumption</h3><p>Then comes the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1–9), a story that immediately follows Noah’s descendants:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Now the whole earth had one language and one speech... Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens...”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The people’s <strong>one language</strong> symbolises a unified but still external and effort-based inner dialogue trying to reach the heavens but doing so through outdated methods of external striving presented through Cain.</p><p>God’s confusion of their language—scattering and fragmenting their speech—does not represent a punishment, but the <strong>insertion of a new principle</strong>: the Law of Assumption.</p><p>When their “language” (inner conversation, assumptions) becomes scattered, <strong>the old way is disrupted</strong>, forcing a shift in how reality is created—from external effort to imaginative <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">inner assumption</a>.</p><hr><h3>Abraham: The Beginning of Assumption and New Creation</h3><p>Following Babel, the biblical narrative turns to Abraham, who embodies the new era of <strong>faith, imagination, and assumption</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Abram believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness”</em> (Genesis 15:6).</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong> is quietly introduced—the understanding that reality is shaped by what you imagine and assume as true, not by external toil.  The <a href="creating-with-scripture-word-of-god-and.html">word of God</a> is essentially being implemented.</p><p>Abraham’s call marks the awakening to <a href="elohim-god.html">God within—the governing powers of consciousness</a> recognising their role as the sole creators of reality.</p><hr><h3>Elohim as the Plural Creative Powers Within</h3><p>The story of Babel and its aftermath fit neatly with the concept of Elohim (rendered as <i>God</i> in English) as <strong>the plural judges and rulers within your mind</strong>, as explored in <em><a href="elohim-god.html">The Elohim article</a></em>. Your inner speech, assumptions, and feelings are the true “languages” through which you create and express, and to which life response.</p><p>The confusion of tongues is the breakdown of old, scattered, unconscious thoughts—necessary to usher in the new order of deliberate assumption taught by Abraham and Neville Goddard.</p><hr><h3>The Path Forward: From Toil to Imagination</h3><p>Noah’s flood cleans the slate, but the children of men’s old way of building continues until until the insertion of the law interrupts it. The <strong>confusion of tongues</strong> symbolises the disruption in the old way of thinking, and way of talking to oneself.</p><p>From here forward, the key is to adopt <strong>the Law of Assumption</strong>—to deliberately speak a language that governs your mind, assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled and consciously shaping your reality.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-elohim--god-series.html" class="noTag">Elohim: God Series</a> | <a href="label-genesis-1-26-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 1:26 Series</a> | <a href="label-tower-of-babel-series.html" class="noTag">Tower of Babel Series</a> | <a href="label-word-of-god-series.html" class="noTag">Word of God Series</a></p>
