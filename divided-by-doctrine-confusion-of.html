<h1>The Tower of Babel: A New Principal Language</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>After the great cleansing and renewal symbolised by <strong>Noah’s flood</strong> in Genesis 6–9—which represents clearing away old, faulty assumptions and mental clutter—the thoughts of a person, called the children of men, face a choice: continue building reality through <strong><a href="genesis-47-sin.html">effort, toil, and external labour</a></strong>, or fully embrace the Law of Assumption and build from the inside out.</p>

<p>The "children of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">men</a>" represent ordinary, ungoverned thoughts. They react to the outside world rather than directing life from the inner self. When we begin to elevate our self-concept and assume new states, these scattered thoughts transform into intentional creations, reflecting the true creative power within. These children are later called <i><b><a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel</a></b></i>, and eventually addressed as the '<b><i>church</i></b>' in Paul’s letters.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Children of Men Still Building the Old Way</h3>

<p>After Noah, awareness begins to build again, but still with the old mindset, as Genesis 4:17-24 suggests:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Cain… built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This city represents the <b>old way of building reality</b>—through scattered effort, external work, and reactive thought. Cain symbolises the mind acting without conscious imagination, trying to reach higher states through toil alone.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Tower of Babel: Confusion and the Shift to Inner Creation</h3>

<p>Next comes the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1–9):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Now the whole earth had one language and one speech... Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens...”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The people’s <strong>one language</strong> represents a unified inner conversation focused on external achievement, trying to reach the mind’s “heaven” through old methods. The bricks and mortar of the tower symbolize building with outer materials—the mind associating itself with external things rather than inner truth.</p>

<p>God’s confusion of their language is the law of assumption being introduced. When their inner “language” becomes scattered, <strong>the old method is interrupted</strong>, and the path shifts from external effort to imaginative inner creation.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Abraham: The Beginning of Assumption</h3>

<p>After Babel, <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a> appears as the first to consciously apply <strong>faith, imagination, and assumption</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
“Abram believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness” — Genesis 15:6.
</blockquote>

<p>Here, the Law of Assumption is introduced: reality is shaped by what you imagine and assume, not by external labour. Abraham’s call marks the awakening to <a href="elohim-god.html">God within—the creative powers of consciousness</a>—recognising our role as the architects of our own reality.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Elohim: The Creative Powers Within</h3>

<p>Babel and its aftermath illustrate the concept of Elohim (God) as <strong>the inner judges and rulers of the mind</strong>. Your inner speech, assumptions, and feelings are the “languages” through which reality responds. The confusion of tongues represents the breakdown of old, scattered thoughts, clearing the way for deliberate inner assumption.</p>

<hr>

<h3>From Toil to Imagination</h3>

<p>Noah’s flood clears the slate, but the children of men keep building the old way until the Law of Assumption intervenes. The <strong>confusion of tongues</strong> shows the disruption of outdated thinking and self-talk. From this point, the key is to adopt <strong>the Law of Assumption</strong>: deliberately speak the language of your mind, assume the feeling of your desire fulfilled, and consciously shape your reality.</p>

<p>Think of the Tower as the body: each brick and drop of mortar represents thoughts associated with the external. The mind sits at the top, guiding construction. When built from old ways, the tower is unstable. When built from inner assumption, the tower rises steadily, aligned with conscious intention.</p>
