<h1>His Name Shall Be Called Wonderful</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given:<br>
and the government shall be upon his shoulder:<br>
and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor,<br>
The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.”</em><br>
— Isaiah 9:6 (KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This well-known verse is often understood in traditional terms as a prophecy of the coming of Jesus Christ. But as <strong>Neville Goddard</strong> revealed, the Bible speaks in <strong>symbolic language</strong>, and its true meaning is psychological. Isaiah 9:6 is not a prophecy of a historical birth—it is a revelation of <strong>what happens within</strong> when man awakens to the power of his own imagination.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Child Is Not Born in Time</strong></h2>
<p>“Unto us a child is born” does not refer to a literal event. It describes the moment in which a <strong>new state of being</strong> is born within the individual—the moment you claim, feel, and persist in the assumption of your desire fulfilled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The child is your idea, your assumption, accepted as true and felt as real.”<br>
— <em>Neville Goddard (interpretive paraphrase)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not a boy in Bethlehem—it is the <strong>birth of identity</strong>. The Son is given when you embody the end. You are no longer waiting; you are living from it.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>“The Government Shall Be Upon His Shoulder”</strong></h2>
<p>Neville explained that the government represents <strong>control and direction over one’s inner world</strong>. To place the government upon his shoulder is to place authority in the hands of this new assumption. When the child is born, your world is restructured from the inside out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The assumption governs. It moves the world around you.”<br>
— <em>Neville</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You no longer move from the old man—fear, effort, doubt. A new state now rules. This is the government.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>His Name Shall Be Called…</strong></h2>
<p>These are not proper names in the modern sense but <strong>symbolic descriptions</strong> of what this new state brings with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Wonderful Counsellor</strong> – Because imagination is awe-inspiring in its ability to bring forth what was not there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Mighty God</strong> – Because this power is divine; your imagination is not separate from God—it is God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Everlasting Father</strong> – Because all things spring from this source; the assumed state becomes the father of your reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Prince of Peace</strong> – Because when you dwell in the end, peace follows; striving and seeking fall away.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Across the major Bible translations, this verse is consistently presented as a <strong>fourfold pattern of titles</strong>. While the Hebrew phrase <em>Pele-joez-el-gibbor-abi-ad-sar-shalom</em> could appear to contain more, the scholarly and translational consensus (including the KJV, NIV, ESV, and NLT) treats <strong>Wonderful Counsellor</strong> as a single, compound title—not two separate ones.</p>
<p>These are not names of a man, but <strong>functions within the reader’s own consciousness</strong>—qualities that come alive the moment one lives from the wish fulfilled.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Fourfold Structure Hidden in the Names</strong></h2>
<p>This structure mirrors the Bible’s symbolic use of <strong>four as the number of manifestation, fullness, and creative structure</strong>. Each title corresponds to a distinct <strong>faculty of your own mind</strong>, awakened when you shift identity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Wonderful Counsellor</strong> – <em>The faculty of inner vision and intuitive guidance.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Mighty God</strong> – <em>The power and conviction of belief.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Everlasting Father</strong> – <em>The awareness that your assumptions generate reality.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Prince of Peace</strong> – <em>The rest that comes from living in the end.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>These titles are not about a future messiah, but about <strong>what emerges in you</strong> when a new self is born through assumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This fourfold symbolism is found repeatedly throughout Scripture:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>four rivers of Eden</strong> flowing from the inner garden</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>four faces of the cherubim</strong> (man, lion, ox, eagle)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>four corners of the earth</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>four Gospels</strong>, each expressing a distinct facet of imagination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>fourfold path of manifestation</strong>: <em>Faith, Persistence, Imagination, Praise</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Isaiah 9:6 is not a list of divine titles to admire—it is a <strong>map of the faculties that awaken when the Christ within is born.</strong> It’s an inner coronation.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Real Meaning of Christmas</strong></h2>
<p>Isaiah 9:6 is often read aloud at Christmas time. But as Neville taught, <strong>the true Christmas is not seasonal</strong>. It happens in you, the moment you shift your concept of self and persist in the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To believe that you are what you want to be is to give birth to a new reality. That is the child.”<br>
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not an event once a year. It is <strong>a spiritual event repeated again and again</strong> whenever you give birth to a new identity by assumption.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>A New State Takes the Throne</strong></h2>
<p>The verse ends with names that belong to this new state. Each name points back to your <strong>own imagination</strong>, now awakened. The child governs because it is <strong>your self-concept made active</strong>. It has taken the throne from the former state and now directs your experience.</p>
<p>No longer governed by appearances or habit, you are ruled by the inner truth of I AM.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
