<h1>Rachel and Laban: Shedding Old Assumptions</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In <strong>Genesis 31</strong>, Rachel leaves her father <a href="breaking-establishment.html">Laban</a> and takes his household idols. Through the Law of Assumption and Neville Goddard’s teaching, this moment shows how we mentally move away from an old self-concept while forming a new one.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Rachel: The Responsive Part of the Self</strong></h2>
<p><a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Rachel</a> represents the <strong>responsive side of consciousness</strong> — the part of us that accepts and reacts to the assumptions we hold about ourselves.</p>
<p>This account shows someone who has lived under a previous identity. Laban has shaped how she has been treated and how she has viewed herself. When that identity no longer matches the desired assumption, a shift must happen.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Laban: The Old Thought System</strong></h2>
<p><a href="breaking-establishment.html">Laban symbolises the <strong>old dominant mindset</strong></a> — the assumptions and mental patterns that previously defined a person’s behaviour. These are often inherited and unquestioned.</p>
<p>Rachel leaving Laban demonstrates a <strong>mental departure</strong> from outdated beliefs to form a new unity. This aligns with <strong><a href="genesis-224-love.html">Genesis 2:24</a></strong>: we detach from an old identity in order to unite with the new “I AM”.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.” - Genesis 2:24
    </blockquote>
<h2><strong>The Teraphim: Hidden Old Beliefs</strong></h2>
<p>The household idols represent <strong>old assumptions still operating within</strong>. Rachel taking and hiding them shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>we may reject the old mindset outwardly</li>
<li>yet still carry parts of it subconsciously</li>
<li>change begins before old beliefs fully lose influence</li>
</ul>
<p>These assumptions can remain active even while we move toward a new identity.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Menstruation: Old Patterns Still Present</strong></h2>
<p>Rachel tells Laban she cannot rise because she is menstruating. This shows that although she has left the old environment, the <strong>old cycle of thought is still present</strong>.</p>
<p>She has assumed a new direction internally, but still reacts based on previous beliefs and past treatment. Her shift is <strong>underway</strong>, not yet complete.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Law of Assumption in Action</strong></h2>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that reality changes only when the <strong>new assumption becomes dominant</strong>. Rachel’s experience shows a common stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new identity is chosen</li>
<li>Movement away from the old belief occurs</li>
<li>The old belief still influences reactions</li>
<li>Full embodiment of the new state has not yet happened</li>
</ul>
<p>Her journey depicts the internal conflict of progressing beyond a former self-concept.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Laban Cannot Keep What Is Leaving</strong></h2>
<p>Laban searches but never recovers the idols. The message is clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>The old state cannot reclaim authority once the shift is real</li>
<li>A new assumption, even early on, weakens the former mindset</li>
<li>The separation from the old identity will complete</li>
</ul>
<p>The new self-concept becomes dominant, and the former belief system loses its place.</p>
