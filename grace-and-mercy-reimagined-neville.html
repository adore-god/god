    <h1>Grace and Mercy</h1>
    <p>In the traditional religious context, grace and mercy are often thought of as divine favours — blessings given by a God who judges from afar (a projection of natural men's association with imagination). But for those familiar with the teachings of Neville Goddard, these words take on a different, and deeply empowering, meaning. They become practical principles of inner transformation, tools of spiritual alchemy within the <a href="elohim-god.html">human imagination</a>.</p>
<h2>Grace: The Gift of Assumption</h2>
<p>To Neville, <strong>grace</strong> is the unearned, unmerited capacity to assume a new state of being. It is not something one works for or deserves based on good behaviour. Rather, grace is the inheritance of every human being — the ability to <a href="genesis-111-seed.html"><em>imagine</em> oneself into a new reality</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Grace is <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">God’s</a> gift of Himself to man. It is not earned. You cannot work for it or put God in your debt. You simply accept it.” — <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through grace, you are free to leave behind the old story and enter a new one. It does not require justification. It does not ask for permission. You are simply invited to <em>accept</em> the state you desire as though it were already yours — and in doing so, it becomes your experience.</p>
<p>Grace is imagination’s yes to change.</p><p></p><blockquote>For Christ is the Yes to all the undertakings of God: and by him all the words of God are made certain and put into effect, to the glory of God through us.” — 2 Corinthians 1:20</blockquote><p></p>
<h2>Mercy: The Power of Revision</h2>
<p><strong>Mercy</strong>, in Neville’s framework, is the spiritual act of <em>revising</em> — of <a href="advanced-mastery-of-manifestation-part.html">immediately</a> freeing yourself from the burden of <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">past assumptions, errors, and wounds.</a> When you no longer identify with an old belief or painful event, and you revise it in imagination, you are extending mercy to yourself.</p>
<p>Mercy is not pity. It is not weakness. It is the bold refusal to let your past dictate your future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Learn to become the master of your assumptions and the saviour of your world.” — <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Revision is the tool of mercy. It wipes clean the slate of the subconscious. It says: <em>I will not hold you to that former state. You are free to become new.</em></p>
<h2>Living by Grace and Mercy</h2>
<p>To live by grace is to walk each day knowing that nothing is fixed — that you may assume a higher state at any time.<br/>
To live by mercy is to forgive your own stumblings, release the past, and reimagine your story.</p>
<p>Both are laws of consciousness. Both are acts of love — not from some distant deity, but from the God within you, which Neville identified as your own wonderful human imagination.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-genesis-1-11-series.html">Genesis 1:11 Series</a> | <a href="label-genesis-4-7-series.html">Genesis 4:7 Series</a></p>
