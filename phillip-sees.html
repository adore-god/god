<h1>Phillip 'See's</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Neville Goddard&rsquo;s teaching, the Bible is not history, but a psychological drama unfolding within you. Every character, every scene, and every journey represents a movement of consciousness. One such figure, Philip the disciple, appears only a few times in the New Testament&mdash;but his words and actions point to a central theme in Neville&rsquo;s message: the awakening of <em>vision</em>.</p><p>This article explores Philip&rsquo;s significance through a Nevillean lens, focusing especially on his role in the story of the Ethiopian eunuch. By tracing what Philip says and does in Scripture, we&rsquo;ll see that his true function is not just to tell&mdash;but to help others <strong>see</strong>.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Philip: The Lover of Horses and Guide of the Mind</strong></h3><p>Philip&rsquo;s name comes from the Greek <em>Philippos</em>, meaning &ldquo;lover of horses.&rdquo; While this might seem incidental, Neville Goddard often spoke of <strong>the horse as a symbol of the mind</strong>&mdash;especially the powerful, emotional, imaginative part that carries us into new states of being.</p><p>A <em>lover of horses</em>, then, is not just someone fond of animals, but someone who <strong>understands and reveres the mind</strong>, someone who can <em>ride</em> it with purpose rather than be dragged by it. In other words, <strong>Philip represents the awakened imagination</strong>&mdash;that aspect of you which knows how to guide thought, feeling, and perception toward the truth.</p><p>This symbolism becomes strikingly clear in Acts 8, when Philip joins the Ethiopian eunuch <em>in his chariot</em>. The chariot represents the moving, searching mind. Philip, the inner teacher, climbs aboard&mdash;not to steer it externally, but to help it see internally.</p><hr/><h3><strong>&ldquo;Come and See&rdquo; &mdash; The Invitation to Perception</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, &ldquo;We have found him&hellip; Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo; Nathanael said unto him, &ldquo;Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?&rdquo; Philip saith unto him, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; John 1:45&ndash;46</p>
</blockquote><p>Philip&rsquo;s first words in Scripture are not argumentative or theological. They are simple: <strong>&ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo;</strong> This is deeply aligned with Neville&rsquo;s view that truth is not imposed&mdash;it is <em>perceived</em>. You cannot be taught what God is; you must <em>see it for yourself</em>.</p><p>Nazareth, in Neville&rsquo;s symbolism, is the humble, overlooked part of you&mdash;the place where the divine is born in secret. Philip invites Nathanael (and us) to go beyond appearances and recognise divinity within.</p><hr/><h3><strong>&ldquo;Show Us the Father&rdquo; &mdash; The Struggle to See Within</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>Philip saith unto him, &ldquo;Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.&rdquo; Jesus saith&hellip; &ldquo;He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; John 14:8&ndash;9</p>
</blockquote><p>Even after following Jesus, Philip still looks for God <em>outside himself</em>. This mirrors our own tendency to externalise divinity&mdash;to believe that God is somewhere &ldquo;out there.&rdquo;</p><p>But Jesus replies with one of the most radical statements in all of Scripture: <strong>&ldquo;He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.&rdquo;</strong> For Neville, this is a direct pointer: your own awareness, your imagination, <strong>is</strong> God. There is no other.</p><p>Philip&rsquo;s question reflects our struggle; Jesus&rsquo; answer calls us to awaken. The Father is not another being&mdash;it is the <strong>source of being</strong> within you.</p><hr/><h3><strong>The Ethiopian Eunuch: A Seeker on the Move</strong></h3><p>In Acts 8, Philip encounters a high official from Ethiopia, reading the prophet Isaiah in his chariot. The eunuch is devout, intelligent, and hungry for truth&mdash;but he&rsquo;s still trying to understand Scripture as <em>external history</em>.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Understandest thou what thou readest?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;How can I, except some man should guide me?&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; Acts 8:30&ndash;31</p>
</blockquote><p>The eunuch represents that part of you which is sincere but confused&mdash;trying to grasp truth through intellect alone. His chariot symbolises the restless mind, moving but lacking direction.</p><p>Enter Philip&mdash;the awakened imagination, the lover of horses&mdash;who joins the seeker in his moving thoughts. He does not preach religion. He does not quote doctrine. He <strong>interprets the passage from Isaiah psychologically</strong>&mdash;and that changes everything.</p><hr/><h3><strong>How Philip Helps the Ethiopian to <em>See</em></strong></h3><p>So how does Philip help the eunuch to <em>see</em>?</p><p>He shifts the eunuch&rsquo;s perspective. The man is reading Isaiah literally, and asks if the passage speaks of the prophet or another person. Philip responds by preaching &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;not as a historical figure, but as <strong>the pattern of awakening</strong> within.</p><p>Neville would say this moment is when the seeker stops looking <em>outward</em> for God, and begins to realise that <strong>Scripture is the story of themselves</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The characters of the Bible live not in history but in the human psyche.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>Philip helps the eunuch see that he is not reading about someone else&mdash;he is reading about <strong>his own imagination</strong>, the neglected Christ within him. That&rsquo;s the real sight that awakens. Once he sees this, he&rsquo;s ready to be baptised.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Baptism: A Shift in Consciousness</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptised?&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; Acts 8:36</p>
</blockquote><p>Water in Neville&rsquo;s teaching symbolises psychological truth&mdash;fluid, cleansing, and transformative. Baptism is not a ritual but <strong>a shift in state</strong>. The eunuch no longer sees himself as separate from the divine. He now knows the Word is within him.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip&hellip; and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; Acts 8:39</p>
</blockquote><p>Once the seeker sees clearly, the guide vanishes. Philip disappears&mdash;not because he leaves physically, but because <strong>his purpose is fulfilled</strong>. The eunuch no longer needs a teacher; he has awakened to vision.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Conclusion: From Searching to Seeing</strong></h3><p>Philip&rsquo;s presence in the New Testament is brief but profound. In each moment, he symbolises <strong>the movement from confusion to clarity</strong>, from external religion to inner revelation:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>&ldquo;Come and see&rdquo;</em> &mdash; the invitation to awaken inner perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>&ldquo;Show us the Father&rdquo;</em> &mdash; the struggle to see God within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ethiopian eunuch &mdash; the honest seeker in motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chariot &mdash; the focused but misguided mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Philip &mdash; the awakened imagination, the lover of the mind&rsquo;s power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baptism &mdash; the moment of psychological transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rejoicing &mdash; the state of one who has seen.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is not history. It is <strong>your story</strong>.</p><p>You are the eunuch, reading but not understanding. You are also Philip, the guide within. When you join the two&mdash;when your awakened imagination meets your seeking intellect&mdash;you move from reading to realisation.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Imagination is the only redemptive power in the universe.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; Neville Goddard</p>
