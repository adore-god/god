<h1>Saints &amp; Angels in the Bible and Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Angels are frequently mentioned in the Bible and are often depicted as divine beings that bring messages, guidance, or protection. In Neville Goddard’s teachings, however, angels take on a more symbolic role, representing aspects of our own consciousness and creative power. Drawing from both the Bible and Neville’s insights, we can explore how figures like Gabriel and <a href="micah-and-michael-journey-from-seeking.html">Michael</a>, among others, symbolise inner mental states that help guide and manifest our desires.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Angels as Symbols of Inner Forces</strong></h3><p>For Neville, the Bible is not a literal recounting of historical events but a metaphysical guide to understanding our own mental and spiritual powers. Angels, in Neville's framework, are not physical beings with wings but symbols of divine aspects of the mind—specifically, thoughts and impressions that align with your assumption. They are messages from within, not from the skies, and they emerge <em>after</em> you've accepted a new state of being.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?” – Hebrews 1:14</p>
</blockquote><p>In practical terms, angels represent the creative and protective mental activity that begins once you've imagined and assumed something new. They are the <strong>thoughts and feelings that agree with your desire</strong>—they uplift, guide, and confirm the state you’ve entered.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Gabriel: The Messenger of Imagination and Creative Power</strong></h3><p>In the Bible, Gabriel is the angel who brings divine messages—most notably, the announcement to Mary that she will conceive the Christ child (Luke 1:26–38). In Neville’s teaching, Gabriel symbolises <strong>the moment a new idea takes root in the imagination</strong>—the mental conception of a desire already fulfilled.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Gabriel represents the inspiration and mental acceptance of the divine message that our desires are already fulfilled.” <em>(Inferred from Neville’s work on imagination)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Just as Gabriel brings news of divine conception, so too does our own imagination “conceive” when we receive a mental image or feeling that something <em>already is.</em> Gabriel is that inner flash of conviction that begins the creative process—when we <em>feel</em> something is ours, long before we see it.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Michael: The Protector of Willpower and Focus</strong></h3><p><a href="micah-and-michael-journey-from-seeking.html">Michael</a>, the archangel who leads heaven’s armies in the book of Revelation (12:7–9), represents <strong>mental strength, will, and persistence</strong> in Neville’s symbolic interpretation. Michael is the inner power that defends your chosen assumption from the attacks of doubt, fear, and opposing appearances.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Michael represents the mental strength and focus that protects our desires from doubt and helps us persist in our vision.” <em>(Inferred from Neville’s teachings on mental discipline)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>When you dare to assume a new state, it is <a href="micah-and-michael-journey-from-seeking.html">Michael</a> who helps you <em>hold the line</em>—refusing to let logic, circumstances, or other people's opinions dislodge your inner conviction. In Neville's words:</p><blockquote>
<p>“A change of feeling is a change of destiny.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Michael ensures you <em>keep that feeling alive</em>, warding off anything that contradicts it.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Saints: Perfected States of Being</strong></h3><p>While angels symbolise the inner <em>movement</em> of ideas, <strong>saints</strong> represent the <em>mastery</em> of states. In the Bible, saints are “set apart” or “holy ones.” In Neville’s metaphysical reading, saints are <strong>states of consciousness that have been faithfully inhabited until they express outwardly.</strong> They symbolise you, <em>as you are</em> in the fulfilled version of yourself.</p><blockquote>
<p>“That ye put off… the old man… and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness” – Ephesians 4:22–24</p>
</blockquote><p>To “put on the new man” is to dwell in the feeling of your desire fulfilled. Once that assumption has hardened into fact, the self that has done so is, symbolically, a <em>saint</em>. Not a moral title, but a spiritual achievement—proof that imagination has done its perfect work.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Bringing It Together: Angels as Movement, Saints as Mastery</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Angels</strong> appear <em>within you</em> when you assume a new identity. They are the aligned thoughts, feelings, and inspirations that serve that state—“ministering spirits” to your imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saints</strong> are the version of you who <em>remained faithful</em> to that state, and now live in its fulfilment. They are your own consciousness in perfected form.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In essence:</p><table>

</table><hr/><h3><strong>Conclusion: Unlocking the Power of Angels and Saints Within</strong></h3><p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, angels and saints aren’t supernatural beings to pray to or await—they are aspects of your own consciousness, unfolding within. Gabriel represents the moment your imagination conceives a new reality. Michael is the mental power to protect and persist in it. Saints are the final result: the embodiment of your imagined truth.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The drama of life is psychological. The whole Bible is a drama taking place in the consciousness of man.” – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>Understanding angels and saints through this metaphysical lens gives us a powerful roadmap: assume the state, listen to its angels, guard it with Michael, and become the sainted self who lives it</p><div class="share-dropdown">
