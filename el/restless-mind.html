<blockquote> 
"For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it." — Hebrew 12:11
</blockquote>
<p>Many struggle with what feels like a mind that never shuts up. Thoughts race, inner dialogues chatter, and the silence people expect in prayer or meditation never quite arrives. Both Neville Goddard’s teaching and the Bible speak directly to this state, offering insight into how to work with a restless mind.
</p>
<h4>Imagination is the key</h4>
<p>Neville repeatedly stresses that imagination—not the busy, surface thoughts—is the <a href="../elohim-god.html">creative power of God within</a>. The endless commentary of the mind is what Scripture calls the “natural man” (1 Corinthians 2:14), the conditioned self. By itself it does not create, but it <em>colours</em> and <em>feeds</em> imagination.</p>
<h4>Feeling trumps chatter</h4>
<p>For Neville, it is not the endless stream of words that produces results, but the <a href="../ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">feeling of being something</a>. Even when the head is noisy, <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">once you settle into a felt conviction—“I AM”</a>—that state carries more weight than the chatter.</p>
<h4>Persistence matters</h4>
<p>He often said, “Be faithful to the end.” When the chatter rises, you do not fight it; you simply return to your <a href="../genesis-1-creation.html">imaginal act</a>—first <a href="../genesis-1-creation.html">demonstrated in the opening scenes of the Bible</a>—as often as needed. That gentle returning is itself persistence.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Bible’s Symbolic Teaching</h2>
<blockquote> 
"We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ" — 2 Corinthians 10:5
</blockquote>
<h4>Peace of God vs. noise of the flesh</h4>
<p>Paul describes the “carnal mind” as enmity against God (Romans 8:7)—not because <a href="../genesis-47-sin.html">thoughts themselves are sinful</a>, but because they oppose the quiet certainty of faith. In contrast, Isaiah 26:3 promises: <em>“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee.”</em> The peace comes not from suppression, but from focus.</p>
<h4>Meditation as chewing</h4>
<p>In Hebrew, <em>hagah</em> (to meditate) literally means to mutter or murmur under the breath. Scripture acknowledges the mind’s tendency to repeat itself, but redirects the muttering into constructive grooves—through dwelling on promises, imagination of fulfilment, or praise. The point is not silence, but direction.</p>
<h4>Jesus stills the storm</h4>
<p>The <a href="../zebulunthe-sea-honour-and-dwelling.html">restless sea is a common biblical symbol for the agitated subconscious</a>. When Jesus says <em>“Peace, be still”</em> (Mark 4:39), it illustrates the higher state of awareness bringing calm to the storm of thought.</p>
<h4>From Struggle to Assumption</h4>
<p>The Old Testament often portrays human consciousness contending with itself—the voices of fear, doubt, and resistance. <a href="..mo/sodom-and-gomorrah-neville-inspired.html">Abraham</a> pleads for Sodom, <a href="../jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html">Jacob</a> wrestles the angel, and <a href="../david-and-saul-inner-battle-of-old-and.html">David negotiates with Saul</a>; these stories symbolise the mind arguing with its own limitations. In contrast, as <a href="jesus-high-priest-new-covenant.html">Paul points out in his discourse about the new covenant</a>, Jesus <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">demonstrates a different approach</a>: he does not reason with or attempt to silence the inner chatter. He assumes the reality he wishes to manifest, acting from certainty rather than debate. This shift—from wrestling with thought to embodying the fulfilled state—illuminates the evolution of consciousness and mirrors Neville Goddard’s teaching on persistent imagination: it is not the absence of mental noise that brings results, but the unwavering return to the feeling of the end fulfilled.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Heart of the Matter</h2>
<p>Neville and the Bible converge on the same truth: the chatter itself is not the problem. It is Saul raging, the sea tossing. Your task is not to silence it, but to direct the deeper current—to persist in feeling the end fulfilled, to return again and again to praise, to the imaginal act, to the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM.”</a></p>
