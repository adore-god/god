<h1>What the Bible Teaches You</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The Bible is not a record of ancient history, but a symbolic map of consciousness teaching the <a href="../genesis-47-sin.html">mastery of the mind</a> — that belief brings forth your innermost desires. Each book reveals how imagination, faith, and awareness unfold within you through its personalised identities — the men, women, judges, kings, and rulers within you — and the mental postures they represent.</p>
