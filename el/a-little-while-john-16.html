<h1>A Little While — John 16 and the Movement of Assumption</h1>

<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In John 16:16–24, <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> speaks of a sequence the disciples recognise inwardly but cannot yet stabilise:</p>

<blockquote>
“A little time, and you will see me no more; and again a little time, and you will see me.” — John 16:16 
</blockquote>

<p>This is not describing a physical departure followed by a physical return. It is describing the inner alternation between observing a state of consciousness and occupying that state as identity. The “little time” is not measured by clocks or calendars, but by the <a href="../genesis-126-man.html">movement of attention within the mind</a>.</p>

<h2>Two Positions Within the Same Self</h2>

<p>John represents the self that practises the law consciously — the observing awareness that watches thought, assumption, and inner reaction. This is the aspect of self that learns, tests, and notices how imagination is operating.</p>

<p>Jesus represents the same self embodied — the assumption lived, spoken, and identified with. This is awareness no longer watching the state, but standing within it and moving from it.</p>

<p>When the words say, <em>“you will see me no more,”</em> this is not loss or abandonment. It is the moment attention shifts back into observation — checking circumstances, measuring progress, and noticing the state rather than remaining as it.</p>

<p>When the words say, <em>“again a little time, and you will see me,”</em> this is not a return from elsewhere. It is the reoccupation of the assumed position — the word becoming flesh again as lived experience.</p>

<h2>Sorrow and Joy</h2>

<blockquote>
“And you now have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your hearts will be glad, and no one will take your joy from you.” — John 16:22 
</blockquote>

<p>Sorrow accompanies the sense of separation that arises when the assumed state is viewed from outside. It is the feeling that something is missing, delayed, or not yet secured.</p>

<p>Joy follows embodiment — when the assumption is entered and held as identity. This joy is not emotional excitement, but quiet certainty. With continued practice, the movement between observation and embodiment shortens. The assumed state begins to fix more readily and remain more consistently.</p>

<h2>Figures of Speech</h2>

<p><a href="../john-1629-30-from-parables-to-plain.html">Jesus then explains that these things are spoken in figurative language</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
“I have said these things to you in language which is not clear; but the time is coming when I will no longer say things to you in that way, but will make them clear to you.” — John 16:25 
</blockquote>

<p>This explains why symbolism is necessary in the earlier stages of understanding. When consciousness has not yet absorbed the state, meaning must be carried in image, story, and figure.</p>

<p>Later, this mode gives way to direct knowing. This is not new instruction being added, but lived clarity emerging. The assumption no longer needs explanation because it is being walked.</p>

<h2>Ask and Receive</h2>

<blockquote>
“In that day you will put no questions to me. Truly I say to you, If you make any request to the Father in my name, he will give it to you.” — John 16:23 
</blockquote>

<p>To <a href="../ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">ask here</a> is not to request something from outside the self. It is to assume in the name — the nature — of the embodied state. To receive is not to wait for a later event, but to remain in the assumed position until it becomes natural and unquestioned.</p>

<p>John 16 outlines the inner training of consciousness: from practising awareness, to embodiment, to stability — until the state no longer comes and goes, but abides.</p>
