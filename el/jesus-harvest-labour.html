<h1>Jesus on Reaping, Labour and Harvest:<br/>The Seed Principle</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<blockquote>“You would say, Four months from now is the time of the grain-cutting. Take a look, I say to you, at the fields; they are even now white for cutting. He who reaps gets his reward, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may be glad together. For in this case the saying is true, One sows and another reaps. I sent you to reap that for which you did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their labour.”
— John 4:35–38
<br/> <br/> 
“My vineyard is mine, and I have not kept it.”
— Song of Solomon 1:6
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Again and again the Bible leads back to the same principles. Genesis 1:11 states:</p><blockquote>“Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself.”</blockquote>
<p>Neville Goddard emphasises that <a href="../genesis-111-seed.html">imagination is this seed — complete and perfect in conception</a>. The seed contains the full pattern of fulfilment. Physical effort is not what produces the harvest; the inner act of imagining and assuming the state as real is sufficient.</p>
<p>John 4 reinforces this principle. When Jesus says, <em>“I sent you to reap that for which you bestowed no labour,”</em> he is teaching that imagination brings about physical results, not physical labor itself. It does not require physical work. The harvest can appear in reality simply because it has already been <a href="../genesis-111-seed.html">fully sown in imagination</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Living in the End</h2>
<p>The fields are “even now white for cutting” because, at the level of imagination, the work is already done. The color white symbolises the seen, the manifested, and black the unmanifested and formless. To live in the end is to see and feel the reality of your desire as already present. The act of assuming it as fulfilled is the key to manifestation.</p>
<p>Song of Solomon 1:6 — <em>“My vineyard is mine, and I have not kept it”</em> — illustrates the same principle. Even when it seems that the physical world is out of your control, your inner assumption maintains the seed, ready for harvest. You do not labour externally to make it appear; imagination is the true caretaker of your vineyard.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Labouring for Others’ Assumptions</h2>
<p>Failure to assume your desires leads to labouring under the assumptions of others. When you do not claim <a href="../genesis-111-seed.html">the seed in yourself</a>, you unconsciously adopt the perceptions, fears, and limitations of the world around you. You toil, but the harvest is not yours.</p>
<p>John 4:36 — <em>“One sows, and another reaps”</em> — reminds us that those who do imagine their desires will see their harvest manifest, even if the physical world seems inert. You enter into the labour already completed at the level of consciousness.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Inner Harvest</h2>
<p>Manifestation is not measured by external effort. The sower and the reaper rejoice together because both are contained in one <a href="../ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">act of assumption</a>: the sowing occurs in imagination, and the reaping unfolds naturally in reality.</p>
<p>Living in the end is a conscious recognition that the seed is in itself. By assuming the fulfilled state, you step into what has already been created in consciousness. Physical actions are only the reflection of the harvest, not the cause of it.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Bible’s seed imagery (Genesis 1:11, John 4, Song of Solomon 1:6) emphasises that creation is complete in imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manifestation does not require physical labour; it requires the mental act of assuming the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failing to assume your desires means you labour under the assumptions of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Living in the end aligns your consciousness with the harvest already present, allowing it to manifest naturally.</p></li></ul>
