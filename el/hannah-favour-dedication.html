<h1>Hannah — Favour and Dedication to the Lord</h1>

<img alt="Hannah in Prayer Icon The Way"  src="../images/wp/hannah-prayer.webp">

<p>In Genesis 2:23, Adam beholds the woman and declares:</p>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.”</em></blockquote><p></p>
<p>This <a href="../genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a> is not mere history but symbol: the dedicated, receptive aspect of consciousness. <a href="../genesis-126-man.html">Man</a> represents the conceiver — the “<a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>.” Woman is the womb that receives, carries, and brings forth what has been assumed.</p>
<p>The story does not remain in <a href="../scrolls/label-eden-series.html">Eden</a>. It reappears in Israel’s history, where the pattern is revealed in Hannah.</p>
<h3>Elkanah and the Rival Wife</h3>
<p>Hannah was married to <strong>Elkanah</strong>, who also had another <a href="../genesis-223-woman.html">rival wife</a>, <strong>Peninnah</strong>. <a href="../el/rival-women-bible.html">Peninnah</a> had children, but Hannah was barren. This rivalry is not mere family drama; it is the picture of the soul divided — outward appearances fruitful, but inwardly the true womb of consciousness waiting to conceive.</p>
<h3>Eli and His Sons</h3>
<p>At Shiloh, the priest <strong>Eli</strong> presided, but his sons <strong>Hophni and Phinehas</strong> were corrupt. They represent the offspring of an undisciplined imagination — forms of worship that bear office without true dedication. The Lord declares that Eli’s house would fall, for it was not truly surrendered.</p>
<h3>Hannah’s Prayer and Vow</h3>
<p>In bitterness of soul, Hannah prayed to the Lord and vowed: if a son were given to her, he would be dedicated all his days. She would not claim the fruit as her own, but return it wholly (holy!) to God. Her name means <em>favour</em> or <em>grace</em>, and in her we see the woman of Genesis 2:23 embodied — the soul receptive, dedicated, and yielding its offspring to the Source.</p>
<h3>The Birth of Samuel</h3>
<p>Her prayer was answered. She bore <strong><a href="../samuel-summary-neville-goddard-style.html">Samuel</strong>, whose name means <em>“heard of God.”</a></em> True to her vow, she brought him to Eli at Shiloh, where he was raised in the service of the Lord. Where Eli’s sons corrupted the priesthood, Hannah’s son renewed it. What is born of grace and dedication endures, for it is not claimed as self’s possession but recognised as God’s.</p>
<h3>The Fulfilment of the Archetype</h3>
<p>The thread is clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Genesis, woman is taken out of man — the archetype of receptivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Eli’s house, the failure of dedication brings corruption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Hannah, grace and surrender unite to bring forth a prophet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bible thus reveals its secret: every true manifestation begins in favour, is received in faith, and is dedicated back to the Source. Hannah is the woman of Genesis 2:23 fulfilled — the soul that not only receives but returns.</p>
