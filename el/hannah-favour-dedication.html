<h1>Hannah — Favour and Dedication to the Lord</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<img alt="Hannah in Prayer Icon The Way" src="../images/wp/hannah-prayer.webp">

<p>In Genesis 2:23, Adam beholds the woman and declares:</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>
    “This is now bone of my bones,<br>
    and flesh of my flesh:<br>
    she shall be called Woman,<br>
    because she was taken out of Man.”
  </em>
</blockquote>

<p>This woman symbolises the <strong>receptive and dedicating aspect of consciousness</strong>. <a href="../genesis-126-man.html">Man</a> represents the conceiver — the originating awareness, the <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>. Woman is the inner faculty that receives an assumption, carries it, and brings it to expression. What begins as archetype in Genesis later unfolds historically in Israel — and is made explicit in the story of <strong>Hannah</strong>.</p>

<h2>Elkanah and the Rival Wife</h2>

<p>Hannah was married to <strong>Elkanah</strong>, who also had a rival wife, <strong>Peninnah</strong>. Peninnah bore children; Hannah did not. Symbolically, this depicts a divided inner life: one aspect of mind producing outward results according to appearances and worldly methods, while the deeper, truer womb of consciousness remains barren — not because it is incapable, but because it has not yet been <strong>fully dedicated</strong>.</p>

<p>Peninnah represents mental productivity driven by external validation and repetition. Hannah represents the quieter depth of consciousness that waits to receive from the I AM itself.</p>

<h3>Eli and His Sons</h3>

<p>At Shiloh presided the priest <strong>Eli</strong>, whose sons <strong>Hophni and Phinehas</strong> are described as corrupt. They abused their priestly office while continuing to function within it. Symbolically, these sons represent the <strong>old mental administrators</strong> — habits of thought, belief systems, and inner judgments that attempt to manage spiritual power according to the world.</p>

<p>They are “priests” in name only: inherited modes of thinking that still occupy authority in the mind but lack dedication to the I AM. They perform rituals, but they do not listen. They attempt manifestation through force, entitlement, or tradition rather than surrender and assumption.</p>

<p>Eli himself represents an <strong>aging governing structure of consciousness</strong> — not actively malicious, but no longer discerning. Because he does not restrain these inner sons, the entire house is declared to fall. A <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">mind governed by outdated inner authorities</a> cannot sustain true spiritual perception.</p>

<h3>Hannah’s Prayer and Vow</h3>

<p>Hannah, in bitterness of soul, prays silently — so silently that Eli mistakes her devotion for drunkenness. This detail is crucial. Her prayer is internal, wordless, and directed wholly toward God. She vows that if a son is given, he will be returned entirely to the Lord.</p>

<p>This vow symbolises a decisive inner shift: the receptive consciousness no longer seeks possession of the outcome. The desire is surrendered to the I AM, not used to serve ego or worldly reinforcement.</p>

<p>The name <em>Hannah</em> means <em>favour</em> or <em>grace</em>. Grace here is not reward, but alignment — the state in which consciousness yields completely to its source. This is the woman of Genesis 2:23 in full expression: receptive, faithful, and dedicating the fruit back to the conceiver.</p>

<blockquote>
  “So I have given him to the Lord; for all his life he is the Lord’s.”
  — 1 Samuel 1:28
</blockquote>

<h3>The Birth of Samuel</h3>

<p>Hannah gives birth to <strong><a href="../samuel-summary-neville-goddard-style.html">Samuel</a></strong>, whose name means <em>“heard of God”</em>. Samuel represents a <strong>new psychological faculty</strong>: the ability to hear and discern inner dialogue.</p>

<p>Where Eli’s sons governed by habit and corruption, Samuel governs by listening. He replaces the old priesthood not by force, but by perception. He stands between Saul and <a href="../davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David</a>, hearing, discerning, and mediating between states of consciousness.</p>

<p>Samuel is not the king — he is the <strong>listener</strong>. He anoints Saul (the reactive, fearful state) and later David (the beloved, trusting state). Through Samuel, the inner world learns to distinguish which voice should rule.</p>

<h3>The Fulfilment of the Archetype</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In Genesis, woman is taken out of man — receptivity drawn from awareness.</li>
  <li>In Eli’s house, undedicated mental authorities corrupt perception.</li>
  <li>In Hannah, full surrender gives birth to a new faculty of hearing.</li>
  <li>In Samuel, consciousness learns to discern between Saul and David.</li>
</ul>

<p>The narrative reveals its inner structure: when the old priesthood of habit and worldly reasoning collapses, a new faculty must be born — one that listens rather than reacts. Hannah’s dedication to the I AM produces Samuel, the inner listener, through whom identity transitions from Saul to David.</p>

<p>Thus, manifestation is not merely assuming an end, but cultivating the capacity to <strong>hear rightly</strong>. The I AM conceives. Hannah receives. Samuel listens. And through that listening, the beloved state — David — is finally recognised and enthroned.</p>
