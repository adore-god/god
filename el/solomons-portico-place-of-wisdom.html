<h1>Solomon’s Portico — The Place of Wisdom</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Several times in Scripture, Jesus and his disciples are described as being in Solomon’s Portico. It is easy to imagine this as just a physical setting within the Temple, but language and context points to something deeper. In the Bible, locations aren't physical; they symbolise <em>states of consciousness</em>. Solomon’s Portico represents a mind established in the wisdom of carefully constructed assumption, and the inner wealth of understanding, the <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html"> I AM — a consciousness fully assuming the state of what it would have.</a></p>
<p><strong>Solomon</strong>, whose name comes from <em>shalom</em> — peace, completeness, and prosperity — embodies wisdom matured from the <a href="../davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">heart of David</a>. Where David represents devotion and faith, <a href="../building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html">Solomon represents that same devotion perfectly organised into a mind capable of imagining and assuming the desired end</a>. The Temple he builds is therefore a picture of the mind itself: a structure in which imagination is ordered, assumptions are held, and every desire is perfectly imagined as already fulfilled.</p>
<p>The <strong>Portico</strong>, or porch, serves as the threshold between the inner and outer courts. Symbolically, it marks the place where the inner assumption begins to express itself outwardly. To stand in the Portico is to occupy a consciousness where imagination is settled, the end is assumed, and all outward appearances are secondary to the inner reality already held.</p>
<p>In the Book of Acts, Solomon’s Portico is mentioned explicitly in the BBE translation:</p>
<blockquote>
Acts 3:11 – “And as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Solomon's, greatly amazed.”
<br><br>
Acts 5:12 – “Now a number of signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the Apostles; and they were all together in Solomon's covered way.”
</blockquote>
<p>These passages show the Portico as the place where the assumption is expressed and witnessed. The lame man’s healing is not just a historical miracle; it is the outward manifestation of an inner assumption held by the apostles. The Portico symbolises the mind in which the assumption of the end is fully present, where the imagination is alive, and where what is <a href="../genesis-111-seed.html">assumed in consciousness is reflected in visible reality.</a></p>
<p>When Jesus teaches in Solomon’s Portico, it signifies the living imagination speaking from a consciousness already settled in the end state. The <a href="../the-calling-of-twelve-gospel-story.html">disciples represent receptive minds, learning to inhabit the same assumption</a>. The Portico is therefore not a physical location but the state of mind from which the Christ within expresses itself, bridging inner assumption and outer manifestation.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the Temple itself, every detail — pillars, chambers, and ornaments — reflects the ordered faculties of the mind. The Temple is the mind in which imagination is disciplined, desires are perfectly assumed, and every thought contributes to the manifestation of <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM”</a> as the eternal reality. <a href="../building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html">Solomon’s construction</a> demonstrates that a mind properly imagined and assumed is itself a Temple of God.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>Solomon’s Portico</em> is the inner place of instruction — the consciousness where the end is assumed before it appears. To dwell there is to live in the fulfilled state, letting imagination dictate reality, and allowing the structured mind to manifest the inner assumption outwardly.</p>
