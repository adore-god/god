<h1>Jesus' Main Events: Lazarus, the Wedding, and the Cross</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Within the New Testament, three scenes stand out as profound psychological symbols when read through Neville Goddard’s teaching: the raising of Lazarus, the Wedding at Cana, and the Crucifixion. These events are not isolated miracles but a single internal pattern, revealing how desire is awakened, united, and finally fixed until it becomes reality. This is the hidden arc of manifestation.</p>

<p>Although the New Testament presents the life of Jesus in a linear sequence, the <em>inner</em> meaning that Neville reveals does not unfold in strict chronological time. The Bible gives us events one after another so that the story can be told, but the psychological drama they symbolise is timeless. States of consciousness are not experienced in a fixed order; they rise, overlap, recur, and complete themselves in a single moment of insight or feeling. This is why one may move from John’s birth to Jesus’ ministry, from temptation to resurrection, or from calling the disciples to inner transfiguration in a single thought. The biblical narrative provides the structure, but consciousness experiences its fulfilment simultaneously. In this way, the Gospel story remains faithful to Scripture while revealing its deeper, ever-present psychological truth.</p>

<h3>Lazarus — The Desire Awakened</h3>
<p><a href="../jesus-wept-for-easter-sunday.html">Lazarus appears as something lost, impossible, or long dead</a>. In our own lives, this is the desire we have dismissed as unrealistic or forgotten because of disappointment or delay.</p>
<p>When Jesus calls Lazarus out of the tomb, it symbolises the moment you <strong>revive a desire</strong> you once buried. You recognise it again. You dare to hope. You permit yourself to feel the stirring of what you truly want.</p>
<p>In Neville’s language, this is the moment you <strong>bring the desire back to life within your imagination</strong>. Lazarus represents the <em>inner resurrection of longing</em> — the beginning of every meaningful creation.</p>
<p><strong>Lazarus = the desire awakened.</strong></p>

<h3>The Wedding at Cana — The Desire United With You</h3>
<p>After a desire is realised, something deeper must occur: the <strong>union</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a class="noTag" href="../genesis-224-love.html">Wedding at Cana is the symbolic enactment of Genesis 2:24:</a> <em>“The two shall become one flesh.”</em></p>
<p>This is not the marriage of two people, but the inner marriage of <strong>you and your fulfilled desire</strong>. Here, you accept the wish as part of your identity. You join with it. You take it on as something already yours.</p>
<p>Cana expresses the moment where you feel the state as real, assume it as natural, and allow the new identity to clothe you. This union is what produces the miracle of water into wine: the natural (water) transformed into the realised (wine).</p>
<p><strong>The Wedding = the desire united with you.</strong></p>

<h3>The Cross — The Desire Fixed Until Manifested</h3>
<p>Once the desire is awakened (Lazarus) and united with you (the Wedding), it must be <strong>held</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="../the-crucifixion-symbol-of-maintaining.html">symbolic meaning of the Crucifixion</a>: the <strong>fixation</strong> of the assumption. Not death by defeat, but death by <em>commitment</em>.</p>
<p>Neville says that “dying” in Scripture means <em>living in the end</em> until the old limitations fall away. The cross is the place where the assumption is nailed in place, the old state is left behind, and the new identity is held unwaveringly.</p>
<p>The crucifixion is the endurance of faith. It is the refusal to return to the former self.</p>
<p><strong>The Cross = the desire fixed until manifested.</strong></p>

<h3>The Whole Pattern in One Flow</h3>
<p>Every inner creation follows this sacred sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lazarus</strong> – the desire rises again within you.</li>
<li><strong>Cana</strong> – you marry the desire and become one with its fulfilment.</li>
<li><strong>Calvary</strong> – you hold the assumption until it resurrects as fact.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the psychological spine of the New Testament and the hidden architecture of manifestation. When these three moments unfold within you, the outcome must appear in your world.</p>
