<h1>God Became Man So That Man Could Become God</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p><a href="../scrolls/label-neville-goddard-series.html">Neville Goddard</a> often said,
<blockquote> “God became man so that man could become God.” </blockquote><p>At first glance, this can be confusing. Many imagine a literal divinity entering history—but Neville was speaking about consciousness, not biology. To grasp his point, we must see the Bible as a symbolic guide to reclaiming our inherent creative power.</p><p><strong>God Became Man: The Allegory</strong><br>
In Neville’s framework, Jesus is not a historical figure; <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">he is the perfect embodiment of <em>consciousness aligned with divine imagination</em></a>. The Bible presents Jesus’ life, actions, and teachings as a model of how human consciousness can operate as <a href="../genesis-1-creation.html">God operates</a>—creating, transforming, and manifesting through assumption and belief.</p><p>The “God became man” statement highlights this principle: God’s creative power, which is inherent in all, is shown in human form so we can recognise and learn it. It is the <em>illustration of possibility</em>, not the introduction of a new, external power.</p><p><strong>Man Could Become God: Reclaiming Our Creative Power</strong><br>
The second part—“so that man could become God”—points to a return, or remembering, of what we always possessed. Humanity inherently has the imaginative capacity that God uses to create reality. Over time, we forget this ability, attributing creation to forces outside ourselves.</p><p>By studying <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus and assuming his state of consciousness</a>, Neville teaches that we can awaken our imagination and begin to manifest in alignment with God’s principle. “Becoming God” does not mean physical divinity—it means recognising and operating from the consciousness that <em>has always been creative, unlimited, and God-like</em>.</p><p><strong>Practical Implications in the Bible</strong><br>
Every biblical story can be seen as a lesson in reclaiming this power:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a class="aforce" href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a></strong> demonstrates faith and assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a class="aforce" href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph</a></strong> models imagination shaping reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a class="aforce" href="../davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David</a></strong> shows courage, love, and dominion over the subconscious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a class="aforce" href="../the-calling-of-twelve-gospel-story.html">The Apostles</a></strong> represent ordinary consciousness learning to embody the God-state.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Bible, through these characters, is an instruction manual for learning to live as God-conscious beings in imagination first, with external manifestation following naturally.</p><p><strong>Avoiding Misconceptions</strong><br>
It is easy to misread Neville’s words as advocating literal deification or attributing supernatural status to humans. The truth is subtler and more empowering: <em>the potential to create reality through conscious assumption is universal and internal.</em> The coming of Jesus symbolises the template of perfected consciousness, which we are invited to study, embody, and manifest.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
“God became man so that man could become God” is an allegory for consciousness. Neville’s teaching invites us to awaken to the fact that the divine power in the universe is not external; it is within our imagination. By understanding, assuming, and acting from this inner state, ordinary man can access the creative principle and live in the fullness of what the Bible symbolically calls God.</p>
