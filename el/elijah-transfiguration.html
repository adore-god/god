<h1>Elijah at the Transfiguration: The Meaning</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>At Jesus’ Transfiguration in Matthew 17:1–3, Mark 9:2–4, Luke 9:28–31, the appearance of <a href="../scrolls/label-elijah-series.html">Elijah</a> and <a href="../scrolls/label-moses-series.html">Moses</a> is a clear illustration of the Law of Assumption. In this moment, the Bible shows that all external conditions are secondary; it is the <a href="../to-choir-master-what-it-really-means-in.html">harmonising of consciousness</a> that brings the unseen into reality. Elijah represents the awakened, prophetic state of consciousness that sees the end already fulfilled, while Moses represents the structured order of belief, the Law within—<a href="../the-ten-commandments-interpreted-symbol.html">the commandments as the framework of awareness that gradually leads consciousness to recognise the personal “I AM.”</a> The <a href="../the-glowing-face-of-moses-neville.html">glowing face of Moses</a> after descending Mount Sinai (<em>Exodus 34:29–35</em>) symbolises the radiance that occurs when consciousness fully perceives the Law and reflects the inner presence of imagination focused on individual's own <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>. Jesus, transfigured between them, embodies the state in which imagination and assumption are fully realised and manifest.</p>

<h2>Elijah as the Voice of Assumption</h2>
<p>Elijah is the Bible’s symbol of the inner prophet—the part of consciousness that perceives the fulfilled desire before it appears externally. His presence signals that to manifest any reality, one must first live in the end. For example, in <em>1 Kings 18:36–38</em>, Elijah calls down fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice on Mount Carmel. In Neville’s framework, this is consciousness fully assuming the desired outcome, faith made real in imagination—which produces the corresponding external manifestation. Just as Elijah acted as the preparatory force for God’s revelation, the Law of Assumption teaches that the external world cannot change until consciousness has assumed the desired state as real.</p>

<h2>Moses and the Structure of Belief</h2>
<p>Moses embodies the Law as recorded in Scripture—the internal order and principles that guide consciousness. <a href="../the-ten-commandments-interpreted-symbol.html">The commandments represent an initial stage of awareness</a>, showing consciousness what is aligned with God. As one engages with the Law, awareness gradually awakens to the “I AM,” the inner presence of God within. The radiance of Moses’ face after receiving the commandments demonstrates that a consciousness fully aligned with God naturally manifests a visible reflection of inner illumination (<em>Exodus 34:29–35</em>). Within Neville’s framework, Moses is not simply the historical lawgiver, but the structured awareness that supports and stabilises assumption. Together with Elijah, this demonstrates that both the recognition of inner order (Law) and the awakened vision (Prophecy) are necessary for the full manifestation of desire.</p>

<h2>The Transfiguration as Manifestation</h2>
<p>The Bible describes Jesus’ face shining and His garments becoming dazzling white. In Neville’s terms, this is the moment the assumed state is perceived in consciousness, what He imagines internally radiates outward. The disciples witnessing this were seeing the effect of a fulfilled assumption made real within consciousness. Elijah’s appearance shows that prophetic awareness precedes manifestation; the end must first be lived and seen internally before it manifests externally, just as Elijah had assumed victory over Baal before the fire fell.</p>

<h2>Preparation of Consciousness</h2>
<p>The mountain setting and the disciples’ elevated awareness highlight that manifestation occurs in consciousness first. Elijah signals that the state of the mind must be prepared and aligned. The Law of Assumption teaches that one cannot wait for conditions to change outside; the inner state—the prophetic vision, the assumption of the end—must be fully held and felt. Moses demonstrates that inner order and recognition of the “I AM” are stabilising forces, providing the structure necessary for the fully assumed desire to appear. The Transfiguration, then, is a biblical demonstration of this inner law at work.</p>

<h2>Lesson for Practitioners</h2>
<p>From Neville’s perspective, Elijah at the Transfiguration teaches that to <a href="../ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">manifest anything</a>, you must assume it internally as already real. Jesus’ glorified state is the evidence of perfect assumption: Law (Moses) stabilised, imagination (Elijah) awakened, and the desired state fully realised in consciousness. The Bible shows that manifestation is not external effort but living in the end, fully and without doubt, and allowing that inner reality to radiate outward.</p>
