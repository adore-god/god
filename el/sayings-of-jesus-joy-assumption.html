<h1>Sayings of Jesus: Joy of Assumption</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>When <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> speaks to His <a href="../twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">disciples</a> about joy, peace, union, and being with Him, He is not describing a distant heavenly promise. He is revealing the inner relationship between the individual and their own awareness of <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">&ldquo;I AM&rdquo;</a>. These statements act as invitations into a mental posture &mdash; a state of consciousness &mdash; in which desire is already fulfilled.</p>
<p>The apparent division between the self and its assumption exists only because <a href="../the-locked-garden-and-flaming-sword.html">doubt first severed man from imagination in the Garden of Eden</a>. The return to the Father is the return to the Self &mdash; the reunion of awareness with its own belief.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that when Jesus says:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;I in you, and you in Me&rdquo; &mdash; John 14:20</blockquote>
<p>He is describing the alignment of one&rsquo;s inner assumption with imagination. To abide in Him is to live from the end &mdash; to adopt the conviction that what one seeks is already one&rsquo;s reality. Joy then is not a reaction to external success, but the <a href="../genesis-1-creation.html">natural state of consciousness resting in fulfilment first demonstrated in the opening of Genesis.</a>.</p>
<p>Each statement below can therefore be read as symbolic instruction: enter the state, remain there, and the outward world conforms to it.</p>
<h3>1. Joy as Fulfilment</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.&rdquo; &mdash; John 15:11</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Assume the end so fully that joy precedes physical evidence.</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;&hellip;no one will take your joy from you.&rdquo; &mdash; John 16:22</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Inner certainty that cannot be shaken by appearances.</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;&hellip;ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.&rdquo; &mdash; John 16:24</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Ask inwardly with assumption &mdash; fulfilment is assured.</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;&hellip;that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves.&rdquo; &mdash; John 17:13</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Share the consciousness of completed desire.</p>
<h3>2. Union &mdash; &ldquo;With Me Where I Am&rdquo;</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;&hellip;today you will be with Me in Paradise.&rdquo; &mdash; Luke 23:43</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Paradise is the state where prayer is answered &mdash; enter it now.</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;&hellip;that where I am you may be also.&rdquo; &mdash; John 14:3</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Move mentally into the fulfilled state immediately.</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;&hellip;you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; &mdash; John 14:20</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> The desire and the desirer are united as one identity.</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Abide in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; &mdash; John 15:4</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Maintain the assumption &mdash; remain in fulfilment.</p>
<h3>3. Peace &mdash; The End Already Settled</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Come to Me&hellip; and I will give you rest.&rdquo; &mdash; Matthew 11:28&ndash;30</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Rest is the signal that the work is finished within.</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;My peace I give to you&hellip;&rdquo; &mdash; John 14:27</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Peace is the emotional signature of answered prayer.</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;&hellip;in Me you may have peace&hellip;&rdquo; &mdash; John 16:33</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Abiding in the end produces calm acceptance.</p>
<h3>4. Life Abundant &mdash; The Nature of &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.&rdquo; &mdash; John 10:10</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> The fulfilled state is expansive, never constrained.</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;&hellip;whoever comes to Me I will never cast out.&rdquo; &mdash; John 6:37</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Enter the desired state confidently &mdash; it cannot reject its own.</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;&hellip;to give eternal life&hellip;&rdquo; &mdash; John 17:2</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Eternal life means fulfilment is now &mdash; timeless and present.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>These sayings are for comfort as well as instruction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assume the state as already yours.</li>
<li>Abide without wavering.</li>
<li>Let joy, peace, and rest prove the fulfilment.</li>
<li>The outer world will conform as shadow to its prototype.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be &ldquo;with Him&rdquo; is to remain mentally in the end &mdash; one with the fulfilled desire.</p>
