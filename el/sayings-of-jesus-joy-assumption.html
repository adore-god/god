<h1>Sayings of Jesus: Joy of Assumption</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>When <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> speaks to His <a href="../twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">disciples</a> about joy, peace, union, and being with Him, He is not describing a distant heavenly promise. He is revealing the inner relationship between the individual and their own awareness of <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM”</a>. These statements act as invitations into a mental posture — a state of consciousness — in which desire is already fulfilled.</p>
<p>The apparent division between the self and its assumption exists only because <a href="../the-locked-garden-and-flaming-sword.html">doubt first severed man from imagination in the Garden of Eden</a>. The return to the Father is the return to the Self — the reunion of awareness with its own belief.</p> 

<p>Neville Goddard taught that when Jesus says:</p>

<blockquote>“I in you, and you in Me” — John 14:20</blockquote>

<p>He is describing the alignment of one’s inner assumption with imagination. To abide in Him is to live from the end — to adopt the conviction that what one seeks is already one’s reality. Joy then is not a reaction to external success, but the <a href="../genesis-1-creation.html">natural state of consciousness resting in fulfilment first demonstrated in the opening of Genesis.</a>.</p>

<p>Each statement below can therefore be read as symbolic instruction: enter the state, remain there, and the outward world conforms to it.</p>

<h3>1. Joy as Fulfilment</h3>

<blockquote>“These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.” — John 15:11</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Assume the end so fully that joy precedes physical evidence.</p>

<blockquote>“…no one will take your joy from you.” — John 16:22</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Inner certainty that cannot be shaken by appearances.</p>

<blockquote>“…ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.” — John 16:24</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Ask inwardly with assumption — fulfilment is assured.</p>

<blockquote>“…that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves.” — John 17:13</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Share the consciousness of completed desire.</p>

<h3>2. Union — “With Me Where I Am”</h3>

<blockquote>“…today you will be with Me in Paradise.” — Luke 23:43</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Paradise is the state where prayer is answered — enter it now.</p>

<blockquote>“…that where I am you may be also.” — John 14:3</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Move mentally into the fulfilled state immediately.</p>

<blockquote>“…you in Me, and I in you.” — John 14:20</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> The desire and the desirer are united as one identity.</p>

<blockquote>“Abide in Me, and I in you.” — John 15:4</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Maintain the assumption — remain in fulfilment.</p>

<h3>3. Peace — The End Already Settled</h3>

<blockquote>“Come to Me… and I will give you rest.” — Matthew 11:28–30</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Rest is the signal that the work is finished within.</p>

<blockquote>“My peace I give to you…” — John 14:27</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Peace is the emotional signature of answered prayer.</p>

<blockquote>“…in Me you may have peace…” — John 16:33</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Abiding in the end produces calm acceptance.</p>

<h3>4. Life Abundant — The Nature of “I AM”</h3>

<blockquote>“I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.” — John 10:10</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> The fulfilled state is expansive, never constrained.</p>

<blockquote>“…whoever comes to Me I will never cast out.” — John 6:37</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Enter the desired state confidently — it cannot reject its own.</p>

<blockquote>“…to give eternal life…” — John 17:2</blockquote>
<p><strong>Posture:</strong> Eternal life means fulfilment is now — timeless and present.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>These sayings are for comfort as well as instruction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assume the state as already yours.</li>
<li>Abide without wavering.</li>
<li>Let joy, peace, and rest prove the fulfilment.</li>
<li>The outer world will conform as shadow to its prototype.</li>
</ol>

<p>To be “with Him” is to remain mentally in the end — one with the fulfilled desire.</p>
