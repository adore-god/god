<h1>Jesus: Once for All Sins — Historical vs Psychological</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Hebrews 7:27 states:</p><blockquote>
<p>“He [Jesus] does not need to offer sacrifices daily, as the high priest does…for he did this once for all when he offered himself.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Traditional Christianity interprets this literally: <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a>’ physical death on the <a href="../scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html">cross</a> was a singular, ultimate sacrifice for the sins of all humanity. The phrase “once for all” (Greek: <em>hapax</em>) emphasises that this one act permanently reconciles everyone to God. Other supporting passages include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hebrews 9:12</strong> – “…he entered once for all into the holy places…by means of his own blood, thus securing eternal redemption.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hebrews 9:26-28</strong> – “…he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself…Christ…having been offered once to bear the sins of many…”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hebrews 10:10-12</strong> – “…we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all…But he, having offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1 Peter 3:18</strong> – “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God…”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In this interpretation, “sins” are understood morally or ethically—wrongdoing that requires atonement through Jesus’ physical sacrifice.</p><p>Neville Goddard’s interpretation reframes the same verses internally:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“Once for all” refers to a complete act within consciousness.</strong> <a class="noTag aforce" href="../the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Jesus, as the I AM</a>, demonstrates the full realisation of creative awareness. The <a class="noTag aforce" href="../scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html">crucifixion</a> symbolizes the inner “letting go” of old limitations and the full assumption of a fulfilled state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“All” encompasses every state of consciousness.</strong> It is not literal humanity outside you, but all <a class="noTag aforce" href="../elohim-god.html">inner conditions</a>—<a class="noTag aforce" href="../genesis-47-sin.html">doubt, fear, lack, or misalignment</a>—that block manifestation. In this sense, <a class="noTag aforce" href="genesis-47-sin.html">“sins”</a> represent psychological states rather than moral failings.</p><p>
Further, the 'all' are the manifold aspects of self as the 'us' first stated in <a class="noTag aforce" href="../genesis-126-man.html">foundational verse Genesis 1:26: "and God said, 'let Us make man in Our image'</a>, and the those Paul addresses in his letters.
</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>The name of God, I AM, is the key.</strong> Recognition of your consciousness as the creative power is the “once for all” act. Once you fully inhabit the <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>, every limitation is encompassed and transformed, eliminating the need for external rituals or repeated sacrifices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In short, traditional Christianity externalises redemption through a historical event, whereas Neville internalises it through awareness. The crucifixion and resurrection become symbolic of a complete inner transformation: the conscious realisation that imagination, expressed through the I AM, is sufficient to create and transform all states of being.</p><p>This interpretation clarifies the meaning of the New Covenant. It is no longer about obedience to external law or ritual but about living from the end—assuming the fulfilled state and recognising the creative power already present within.</p>
