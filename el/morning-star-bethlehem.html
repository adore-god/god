<h1>The Morning Star</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The <strong>Star of Bethlehem</strong> and the <strong>Morning Star</strong> are not two separate wonders, but one inner sign revealed at different moments of awakening. The Bethlehem Star appears at the birth of <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> — not a birth in history, but the mystical birth of <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ in you</a>. It is the signal that a new state has been conceived within, and wise faculties — the Magi of your being — are drawn to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>The <strong>Morning Star</strong> is the same light, seen again at dawn. It shines in the darkest hour just before sunrise, heralding the certainty that what was born in secret will soon stand revealed. Revelation joins the Morning Star with the offspring of David, <a href="../davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">showing that the promise of love embodied in David the beloved is fulfilled when Christ rises in you</a>.</p>
<p>Peter himself speaks of this same reality:</p> <blockquote>“We have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts” — 2 Peter 1:19
</blockquote> <p> He and the others claimed they were “eyewitnesses of his majesty,” having heard the voice declare, </p> <blockquote> “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”</blockquote>
<p>Neville would tell us this is not history recorded but experience repeated — the eternal announcement spoken within when the Christ-child is born in you.</p>
<p>Together, the two stars tell one story: the inner Christ has been born, and the light of that birth is about to break through the horizon of your world. One star appears at the cradle of the new life, the other at its dawning — both declaring that imagination, the true light of the world, has risen within.</p>
