<h1>Jacob and Moses: A Comparative Blessing</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>

<p>The Bible presents two monumental blessings: <a href="../scrolls/label-jacob-s-twelve-son-s-and-tribes-series.html"><strong>Jacob’s blessing</strong> of his sons</a> in Genesis 49 and <strong>Moses’ blessing</strong> of the tribes in Deuteronomy 33. Viewed through the lens of the <em>Law of Assumption</em>, as revealed by Neville Goddard, these blessings are psychological patterns that continue to reveal the faculty and nature of imagination. <a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Jacob</a> speaks to individual potential and inner disposition, showing the inner states or assumptions held by each son. <a href="../scrolls/label-moses-series.html">Moses</a> speaks to collective inheritance and functional capacity, demonstrating how assumed states manifest externally when consciousness aligns with imagination. Together, they reveal the progression from inner assumption to outer manifestation—first, identifying states within the mind; then, seeing them operationalised in reality.</p>

<h2>Jacob’s Blessing: Inner States, Emotional Symbolism, and Assumption</h2>
<p><a href="../scrolls/label-jacob-s-twelve-son-s-and-tribes-series.html">Jacob’s words reveal the <em>emotional moods, inner drives, and assumed states</em> of his sons </a>. Each animal image symbolises a state of consciousness that, in Neville’s terms, forms the seed of manifestation:</p>
<p> 
<a href="../scrolls/label-jacob-s-twelve-son-s-and-tribes-series.html">PLEASE CHECK OUT THE SERIES OF ARTICLES ON JACOBS BLESSING HERE</a> 
</p> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Reuben (water)</strong> – Restlessness and emotional instability, reflecting an unsteady assumption that prevents a firm reality from forming.</li>
<li><strong>Simeon & Levi (swords)</strong> – Anger, aggression, scattered energy; assumptions clouded by conflict that scatter the creative power of imagination.</li>
<li><strong>Judah (lion)</strong> – Courage, authority, and stabilising leadership mood; an assumption of strength and dominion that generates external influence.</li>
<li><strong>Zebulun (sea/commerce)</strong> – Curiosity, adaptability, and openness; the assumption of receptivity allows new experiences to flow into consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>Issachar (donkey)</strong> – Patience, endurance, acceptance; the assumption of steadfastness manifests in consistent, reliable outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Dan (serpent)</strong> – Insight, cunning, strategic intelligence; an assumption of resourcefulness creates solutions to challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Gad (raider imagery)</strong> – Resilience, proactive energy, triumph; assumptions of overcoming obstacles bring actual victories into being.</li>
<li><strong>Asher (abundance)</strong> – Satisfaction, receptivity, pleasure; assuming abundance primes the imagination to attract wealth and comfort.</li>
<li><strong>Naphtali (deer)</strong> – Creativity, freedom of expression, agility; assuming freedom and beauty allows creative ideas to flow unblocked.</li>
<li><strong>Joseph (fruitful bough)</strong> – Growth, hope, imaginative influence; the assumption of prosperity and productivity ensures generative outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Benjamin (wolf)</strong> – Fierce drive, assertiveness, survival instinct; the assumption of strength and hunger powers decisive action in life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jacob’s blessing is <strong>diagnostic</strong>: it exposes the assumptions already present in the mind of each son, giving insight into the <a href="../genesis-111-seed.html">seeds of imagination</a> that will eventually shape their lives. Neville would say that by recognising these inner states and assuming their reality, one aligns consciousness with the creative power within.</p>

<h2>Moses’ Blessing: Functional Expression of Assumed States</h2>
<p>Moses blesses the tribes after the formation of Israel, emphasising what each tribe can contribute in the land. This reflects the second stage of the Law of Assumption: the manifestation of previously assumed states. The tone is <strong>consecrative and constructive</strong>, affirming external expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reuben</strong> – Preservation and survival; the inner assumption of stability is now externally affirmed.</li>
<li><strong>Judah</strong> – Leadership, guidance, praise; the assumed courage and authority now manifests as influence and dominion.</li>
<li><strong>Levi</strong> – Priesthood and spiritual service; assumed spiritual alignment produces tangible service and purpose.</li>
<li>Other tribes – Focus on land, abundance, security, and prosperity; their assumed inner states of receptivity, diligence, and courage are now externally realized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moses’ blessing illustrates the <strong>functional expression of assumed states</strong>. What Jacob revealed psychologically is now operationally affirmed—the inner assumption, when fully imagined and believed, becomes external life.</p>

<h2>Comparative Summary</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Jacob</th><th>Moses</th></tr>
<tr><td>Focus</td><td>Individual sons’ inner states, moods, and assumptions</td><td>Tribes as functioning collective bodies manifesting those assumptions</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tone</td><td>Diagnostic, revealing latent assumptions and tendencies</td><td>Consecrative, affirming, and operational</td></tr>
<tr><td>Timing</td><td>Before entering Egypt; before formation of Israel</td><td>Before entering the Promised Land; after formation of Israel</td></tr>
<tr><td>Purpose</td><td>Expose psychological potential and inner assumptions</td><td>Confirm operational capacity and manifestation of assumed states</td></tr>
<tr><td>Symbolism</td><td>Animals and imagery represent emotional moods, inner states, and assumptions</td><td>Focus on external function, abundance, and priesthood as results of aligned assumptions</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>The Spiritual Lesson and Neville’s Framework</h2>
<p>Through the lens of the Law of Assumption, Jacob’s and Moses’ blessings reveal a two-step process of manifestation: first, identify and assume the desired state internally, as Jacob’s diagnostic blessings illustrate; then, allow these assumptions to operate outwardly, as Moses’ consecrative blessings affirm. Jacob teaches <strong>self-awareness and recognition of inner states</strong>, while Moses teaches <strong>alignment and functional expression</strong>. In Neville’s framework, imagination is the creative act, and belief or assumption is the operational force that shapes reality. Together, these blessings demonstrate the principle that consciousness, once assumed and imagined, becomes the fabric of lived experience—a lesson central to both the Bible and the Law of Assumption.</p>
