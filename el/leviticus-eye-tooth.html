<h1>Leviticus — Eye for Eye Symbolism</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Leviticus 24:17–23 is often read literally: <em>“Whoever takes a human life shall be put to death…fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth.”</em> Neville Goddard’s framework encourages us to see beyond the literal, understanding these verses as symbolic depictions of inner states and the consequences of our assumptions—rooted in the <a href="../genesis-111-seed.html">fundamental principle of the seed in itself</a> and the allegory of the <a href="../el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">'head as the house.'</a></p>
<h3>The Eye as Perception (Leviticus 24:20)</h3>
<p>The eye represents your perception—how you see and interpret reality within your imagination. When the law says “eye for eye,” it symbolises the natural effect of your imagined assumptions. If your perception holds judgment, anger, or harm, it returns in equal measure, because imagination is the soil from which experience grows.</p>
<h3>The Tooth as Words and Expression (Leviticus 24:20)</h3>
<p>The tooth symbolises the articulation of thought—the words you speak and the ideas you express. As the eye shows what you perceive, the tooth expresses it. Just as “tooth for tooth” illustrates, your spoken assumptions manifest consequences equivalent to their inner source.</p>
<h3>Fracture and Life (Leviticus 24:17–18)</h3>
<p>“Fracture for fracture” and the death penalty reflect the creative power of imagination. Each act of harm, whether in thought, perception, or word, leaves an impression on your inner state. Neville teaches that our assumptions are seeds; the law of correspondence ensures that what you plant mentally will manifest externally, mirroring the spiritual ‘fractures’ you hold inside.</p>
<h3>The Principle of Equivalence (Leviticus 24:19–22)</h3>
<p>These verses describe an exacting principle: the measure you give is the measure you receive. Symbolically, this is not a command from outside but a natural law of consciousness. Your <a href="../genesis-111-seed.html">inner assumption determines outer experience</a>, and every thought of <a href="../cain-lamech-and-jesus-psychology-of.html">injustice, anger, or retribution</a> creates a reflection in the outer world, just as an equal blow follows from an equal cause.</p>
<h3>The Unity of Law and Imagination</h3>
<p>Leviticus 24:17–23 is a reminder that consciousness is structured and exact. Your imagination is not chaotic; it follows precise laws. Perception (eye), expression (tooth), and creative power (fracture/life) operate in balance. Recognising this, you can choose assumptions aligned with your desires rather than reactive impulses, ensuring harmony instead of mirrored conflict.</p>
<h3>Living the Principle</h3>
<p>When you internalise this teaching, the “eye for eye” law ceases to be punitive and becomes instructive. Every experience, positive or negative, is the direct outcome of your inner assumptions. Change the assumption within, and the mirrored reality transforms accordingly. This is the law of assumption in action, the unseen principle Jesus later demonstrated in life and parables.</p>
<p>In line with this, <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus'</a> teaching to “turn the other cheek” in Matthew 5:38-42 is symbolic, not about physically turning away. It represents offering the second cheek to an aggressor—acknowledging the first strike as a trigger of the old reactive self, and consciously refusing to respond from that state. By doing so, you <a href="../genesis-47-sin.html">assert mastery over your inner consciousness</a>, demonstrating that your power is rooted in your assumptions and not in reactive impulses, transforming the encounter into an exercise of higher awareness and self-mastery.</p>
