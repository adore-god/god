Here’s a tight, debate-ready version under 120 words:

Most people read the Bible as a book about an external God, but that’s not what the text literally says.

The Hebrew word **Elohim**, usually translated as “God,” is plural and means **judges and rulers**. Combined with **YHVH / Ehyeh (“I AM”)**, it describes **consciousness judging and ruling itself**—the human mind governing its own actions.

This is evident in the Bible’s structure through **patterns of command and consequence** and the **continuous deposing and imposing of rulers**.

Job illustrates this perfectly: he complains to “God” about injustice, expecting external intervention. Nothing changes—until he realizes that **he has been his own judge and ruler all along**. The narrative is about **self-governance and internal authority**, not obedience to a mystical being.
