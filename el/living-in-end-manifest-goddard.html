<h1>Isaiah's Living in the End</h1>

<div class="container">
<main class="content">


<p>Neville Goddard’s teaching on <em>living from the end</em> shows that <a href="../genesis-1-creation.html">creation</a> is <a href="../the-completion-of-creation-and.html">complete</a> in imagination and that our only task is to assume the state of the wish fulfilled. Isaiah 46:8–13 speaks directly of this. Reading the passage verse by verse&nbsp;allows us to explore its full significance.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Remember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors.” (Isaiah 46:8, ESV)</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville would say: <em>standing firm</em> means <a href="../in-my-fathers-house-john-142-3.html">occupying in imagination the state you desire</a>, despite appearances. To “remember this” is to recall the eternal principle that what you assume in imagination will manifest. The “transgressors” are those who live by sense evidence rather than the imagined end.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Remember the former things of old; for I AM God, and there is no other; I AM God, and there is none like me.” (Isaiah 46:9, ESV)</p>
</blockquote><p>The repeated declaration “I AM” is central. In Neville’s teaching, <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM” is the statement of consciousness itself</a> — the creative power within you. It is the self-aware imagination that is always present, unchanging, and sufficient to bring any assumed state into manifestation. By saying “I AM God”, the text points to the fact that your awareness, <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">your imaginative “I AM,” is the source of all creation</a>.</p><p>The “former things of old” remind us that all states exist eternally in consciousness — nothing truly new is created, only assumed. To recognise “I AM” is to claim that creative power as your own, stepping fully into the role of the imaginative creator of your experience.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done.” (Isaiah 46:10, ESV)</p>
</blockquote><p>This is Neville’s principle in one line: the end is already determined in imagination. To <em>live from the end</em> is to assume the outcome as if it were already real. The “things not yet done” are irrelevant to the one who assumes their fulfilment now.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country.” (Isaiah 46:11, ESV)</p>
</blockquote><p>The “bird of prey” (eagle) symbolizes swift, decisive movement of life’s unseen forces once the end is assumed. In Biblical symbolism, the eagle appears in Ezekiel’s four living creatures and is traditionally associated with <a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">John’s Gospel — spiritual vision soaring above appearances</a>. The “man of my counsel” represents the conception of self (Genesis 1:26) acting in alignment with imagination’s decree.</p><blockquote>
<p>“I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.” (Isaiah 46:12, ESV)</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville teaches that imagination is the law itself. Once a state is assumed, its fulfilment is inevitable. You do not need to struggle with conditions; the <a href="../scrolls/label-word-of-god-series.html">creative word</a> — your imagined assumption — is sufficient.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Listen to me, you stubborn of heart, you who are far from righteousness: I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off, and my salvation will not delay; I will put salvation in Zion, for Israel my glory.” (Isaiah 46:13, ESV)</p>
</blockquote><p>The “stubborn of heart” reflects the part of consciousness that resists assuming the fulfilled state. Salvation is Zion — the awareness of fulfilment — and Israel is glory, the awakened self. Neville’s teaching is mirrored here: the end is near when you dwell in the assumed state, <a href="../the-symbolism-of-abraham-and-isaac.html">even if appearances suggest otherwise - taught in the story of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac.</a></p><p>Reading Isaiah 46:8–13 passage by passage reinforces Neville’s “living from the end”: remember and stand firm, recognise the singular power of imagination, declare the end from the beginning, trust the unseen forces, and accept that salvation is near. Every line of scripture confirms Neville’s teaching: your creative imagination already holds the end; your task is simply to live in it.</p>
