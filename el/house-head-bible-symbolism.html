<h1>House of the Head: Understanding the Mind Through Scripture</h1>

<img alt="Mind House Icon The Way" src="../images/wp/hebrew-alphabet.webp">

<p>The Bible often speaks of <a href="../the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html"><em>houses</em>, <em>doors</em>, and <em>windows</em>.</a> On the surface, these appear as everyday objects, but when read symbolically they reveal a deeper pattern. The house becomes the human self, the head as its temple, the door as the threshold into new states, the window as vision and revelation, and the breath as the spirit animating it all.</p><hr><h2><strong>The House as the Self</strong></h2><p>A house is never just a building in scripture. It represents the <a href="../elohim-god.html">dwelling place of life and consciousness.</a>&nbsp;David’s story illustrates this beautifully. He <a href="../david-and-bathsheba-neville-goddard.html">stood on the roof of his house</a> — his head, his upper room — and looked through the window at what caught his attention. The window here is not merely physical; it is the opening of perception and focus in the mind.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>“A house divided against itself cannot stand”</em> (Mark 3:25). Here the house is clearly the self in conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Unless the LORD builds the house, they labour in vain who build it”</em> (Psalm 127:1). The house is our inner structure, which must be founded on divine awareness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “house of the LORD” and the temple both reflect this same inner dwelling. The temple in Jerusalem mirrors the temple of the head — the seat of thought and imagination.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr><h2><strong>The Door (Dalet)</strong></h2><p><a href="../the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">The Hebrew letter <em>dalet</em></a> literally means “door.” Doors are passages, thresholds between one state and another.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a class="aforce" href="../davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David’s very name,</a> <em>Dalet–Vav–Dalet</em> (דוד), places him between two doors — the beloved framed as the passageway of states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a class="aforce" href="../exodus-314-i-am">Jesus identifies Himself</a> directly: <em>“I AM the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved”</em> (John 10:9). He is the entrance into the higher dwelling of consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revelation 3:20: <em>“Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.”</em> The door is the human threshold of awareness, waiting to be opened.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr><h2><strong>The Window (He)</strong></h2><p><a href="../the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">The Hebrew letter</a> <em>he</em> is pictured as a window, meaning “breath” and “revelation.” If the door is for entry, the window is for vision and spirit flowing in - the screen of space of imagination.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Noah’s ark was given a window (Genesis 6:16), turning the ark into a house of salvation with light flowing in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malachi 3:10: <em>“I will open the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing.”</em> The window is the opening of divine provision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Song of Songs 2:9: <em>“He looks forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice.”</em> The beloved is revealed through the openings of the house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rahab lets the spies down through her window (Joshua 2:15), just as Paul escaped through a window in Damascus (Acts 9:25). Windows can be openings of deliverance.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Windows symbolise revelation, blessing, and breath — the inflow of spirit into the house.</p><hr>
<h2><strong>The Head as House and Temple</strong></h2>
<p>The head is the highest “house” of the body, containing thought, imagination, and perception. In scripture, it mirrors the temple of God.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The “upper room” (Acts 2:1–4) where the Spirit descended is the upper chamber of consciousness — the head as the meeting place of divine breath.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus was crucified at Golgotha, a place whose name means 'the Skull.' <a class="aforce" href="../golgotha-place-of-skull.html">Symbolically, this location represents the head—the seat of consciousness and the mind</a>. Just as the crucifixion marks a pivotal moment of transformation, it points to the fixing of an idea in the mind, the place where old states of being are confronted and transcended, and where new awareness is established.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ecclesiastes 12:3–4 uses a house as a metaphor for the body, describing ageing: <em>“The strong men bow themselves, and the grinders cease… and those that look out of the windows be darkened.”</em> The head, eyes, and breath are framed in house imagery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jacob’s dream at Bethel (Genesis 28:11–19) unites the two symbols directly: laying his head upon a stone, he sees the ladder of heaven, then declares, <em>“This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”</em> The head is where the vision opens and the house of God is named.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul develops the theme of <em>headship</em>: <em>“Christ is the head of the body, the church”</em> (Colossians 1:18), and again, <em>“The husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church”</em> (Ephesians 5:23). The head governs the house, just as consciousness directs the self. Headship is authority of thought ruling the whole dwelling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The head is the true temple, the inner house where God dwells and governs.</p>
<hr><h2><strong>Breath / Spirit (Ruach, Pneuma)</strong></h2><p><a href="../scrolls/label-breath-series.html">Breath is the life that animates the house</a>. The Hebrew <em>ruach</em> and Greek <em>pneuma</em> both mean “breath” and “spirit.”</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Genesis 2:7: God <em>“breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ezekiel 37: <a class="aforce" href="../the-valley-of-dry-bones-awakening-power.html">the dry bones</a> live when the breath enters them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John 20:22: Jesus breathes on His disciples, saying, <em>“Receive the Holy Spirit.”</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Breath is spirit entering through the window (<em>he</em>) of the house, making it alive.</p><hr><h2><strong>The Pattern of House, Door, Window, Head, and Breath</strong></h2><p>When the symbols are drawn together, the Bible reveals a consistent allegory:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>House</strong> = the self, consciousness, the dwelling place of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Door (Dalet)</strong> = the threshold into new states of being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Window (He)</strong> = revelation, vision, and breath flowing into the self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Head</strong> = the true temple, the house of thought and imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Breath / Spirit</strong> = what animates the house through its openings.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>The Bible does not use house imagery casually. The house is you. Your head is its temple. Doors are the thresholds you pass through in states of consciousness. Windows are the openings for light, vision, and the Spirit’s breath. The whole structure lives only when the breath of God flows through it.</p><p>To read the Bible this way is to see that every parable, every promise, every image of house, door, or window is an invitation to understand yourself as the dwelling place of God.</p>
