<h1>Leviticus Symbolism Overview</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Leviticus is a blueprint for consciousness. In Neville Goddard’s framework, the laws, offerings, and rituals describe how assumptions and inner states shape outer experience. Every chapter guides us in mastering imagination, attention, and the law of assumption.</p>
<h3>Offerings and Sacrifices (Chapters 1–7)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burnt Offering:</strong> Total surrender of an idea; flame represents attention and energy of imagination.</li>
<li><strong>Grain Offering:</strong> Nourishment of thought; structured, deliberate focus.</li>
<li><strong>Peace Offering:</strong> Harmonising desires with consciousness; inner alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Sin Offering:</strong> Recognition and transformation of false assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Guilt Offering:</strong> Restoration of balance; correction of misaligned ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Blood:</strong> Life force of imagination; energises assumptions to manifest outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Priests and Consecration (Chapters 8–10)</h3>
<p><strong><a href="../scrolls/label-priesthood-series.html">Priests</a></strong> = conscious awareness directing imagination. Ordination rituals train attention. <a href="../levi-levites-aaron-and-jesus-symbolism.html">The cleaving and joining of the various states and fractures of consciousness</a>. Misuse of imagination, shown in Aaron’s sons’ punishment, illustrates the consequences of misalignment.</p>
<h3>Clean and Unclean (Chapters 11–15)</h3>
<p><a href="../cloven-hooves-fins-and-wings-animals.html">Clean and unclean animals</a> symbolise thoughts or assumptions: some nourish imagination, others hinder it. Purification rituals restore inner harmony. Bodily signs reflect inner discord or misaligned assumptions.</p>
<h3>Yom Kippur and Blood Laws (Chapters 16–17)</h3>
<p>The Day of Atonement resets consciousness; scapegoat represents releasing misaligned assumptions. Blood symbolises life energy directed by attention; proper focus produces manifestation, misfocus creates consequences.</p>
<h3>Moral and Ethical Laws (Chapters 18–20)</h3>
<p>Sexual laws, idolatry, and prohibitions reflect inner alignment. Misalignment creates <a href="../cain-lamech-and-jesus-psychology-of.html">mental conflict.</a> “Curses” <a href="leviticus-disobedience-curses.html">describe natural outcomes of holding destructive assumptions.</a> Conscious attention can restore harmony.</p>
<h3>Hair, Beard, and Body Marks (Chapters 19:27–28)</h3>
<p>Leviticus also includes instructions that at first glance seem unrelated to mental development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“You shall not round off the hair on your temples, or mar the edges of your beard”</strong> (Lev 19:27)</li>
<li><strong>“You shall not make cuts in your flesh for the dead, nor tattoo any marks on yourselves”</strong> (Lev 19:28)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, the <strong>head is the house</strong>—the seat of consciousness where assumptions and imagination reside. These laws symbolise careful stewardship of the assumption - your new visualised self:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hair and Beard:</strong> The hair and beard represent the “face” or appearance of your assumption—the outward expression of the inner state. To “round off” or “mar” them is to distort, suppress, or misrepresent your assumed state. Maintaining them intact = preserving the integrity and authentic expression of your assumption.</li>
<li><strong>Body Marks and Tattoos:</strong> Cutting the flesh for the dead (<a class="aforce" href="../legion-according-to-neville-goddard.html">Legion</a>) represents dwelling on past failures or old states; tattoos represent fixing assumptions permanently in the subconscious. Both are warnings against imprinting limitation or grief onto imagination, which hinders manifestation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, just as <a href="../leviticus-law-adam-and-eve-and-nakedness.html">Leviticus teaches not to “uncover nakedness” of father, mother, or sister</a> (Lev 18), these rules caution against disfiguring or misdirecting the figurative body of the new assumption or imagined self. Proper alignment and respect for the natural flow of assumption allow consciousness to remain fertile and creative.</p>
<h3>Priestly Conduct and Holiness (Chapters 21–22)</h3>
<p>Priests’ restrictions show the need for pure focus. Offerings must be conscious and deliberate; only aligned assumptions produce intended results.</p>
<h3>Feasts, Sabbaths, and Jubilee (Chapters 23–25)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sabbaths:</strong> Rest cycles of consciousness; renewal of attention and imagination.</li>
<li><strong>Festivals:</strong> Heightened states of assumption; deliberate focus on desired outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Jubilee and Slaves:</strong> Slaves = restricted aspects of consciousness (old beliefs, limiting assumptions - <a class="aforce" href="../hagar-and-sarah-battle-between-outer.html">see Hagar</a>). Brothers who become slaves must be treated as hired workers, symbolising gentle reintegration of these inner limitations. Foreign slaves = external habits or ideas; useful if consciously directed. Jubilee = total liberation of consciousness; old limiting assumptions released.</li>
<li><strong>Year of Release:</strong> Letting go of outdated assumptions; reclaiming freedom of imagination.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Eye for Eye (Chapter 24)</h3>
<p>In this passage about an <a href="leviticus-eye-tooth.html">eye for an eye</a>, the Bible uses <a href="house-head-bible-symbolism.html">'head as the house' allegory</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eye:</strong> Perception; reflects how inner assumptions shape outer reality.</li>
<li><strong>Tooth:</strong> Expression; articulation of thought; words and ideas manifest consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Fracture/Life:</strong> Creative power of imagination; each act of harm leaves an impression on consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>Principle of Equivalence:</strong> Inner assumption determines outer experience; law is exact and natural, not punitive.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Child Sacrifice (Chapters 20)</h3>
<p> 
Symbolically, “children” represent our <a href="../scrolls/label-child-like-faith.html">newly-formed thoughts, the tender beginnings of an assumption</a> before it has matured into manifestation.</p><p>To “sacrifice” these <a href="leviticus-child-sacrifice-killing.html">children</a> to Molech means to hand over our delicate new states of imagination to the destructive gods of fear, doubt, or external authority
</p>
<h3>Blessings, Curses, and Vows (Chapters 26–27)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blessings:</strong> Manifestation of aligned imagination; health, abundance, harmony.</li>
<li><strong>Curses:</strong> Outcomes of misaligned inner states; natural consequences of false assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Return and Remnant:</strong> Even after misalignment, consciousness can re-align and create anew.</li>
<li><strong>Vows:</strong> Deliberate commitments of attention; redemption adjusts misaligned assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Leviticus symbolises the structured operation of consciousness. Priests = awareness, offerings = assumptions, blood/oil/bread = energy of attention, clean/unclean = nourishing or hindering thoughts, Sabbaths/Festivals = cycles of renewal, blessings/curses = natural outcomes. Slaves and Jubilee illustrate managing and liberating limiting inner states. Hair, beard, and body marks warn against disfiguring imagination, while “uncovering nakedness” signals dwelling in limiting assumptions. Understanding this turns the law into a guide for mastering imagination and consciously shaping reality.</p>
