<h1>Jesus Riding the Donkey</h1>

<main class="content">
<blockquote> 
“Issachar is a strong donkey,
crouching between the sheepfolds.
He saw that a resting place was good,
and that the land was pleasant,
so he bowed his shoulder to bear,
and became a servant at forced labor." - Genesis 49:14-15

<small class="blockquote-cap">
In <span class="noTag">Genesis 49</span> <a href="../scrolls/label-jacob-s-twelve-son-s-and-tribes-series.html">Jacob frames his sons’ qualities and positions within consciousness</a> — a pattern fulfilled here.
	</small>
</blockquote>
<p>In the New Testament, <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> riding into Jerusalem on a young donkey/colt (Matthew 21:1–11, Mark 11:1–11, Luke 19:28–44, John 12:12–19) represents an allegory of consciousness. The colt is a disciplined, unbiased aspect of self—ready to carry the realised state of awareness. This is about an aspect of the lower, now domesticated self that can respond reliably, carry the creative intention steadily, and participate fully in the manifestation of the imagined state.</p><p></p><h2><strong>The Colt: Unbiased And Disciplined Aspect of Self</strong></h2>
The colt upon which Jesus rides has never been ridden before. Symbolically, this reflects a part of self that has not been shaped or influenced by other forces. It is pure potential, responsive to conscious intention. By “riding” it, Jesus (as consciousness) demonstrates mastery: this facet of self can now carry the creative state without deviation.<p></p><p></p><h2><strong>Integration of Faculties</strong></h2>
Just as <a href="../balaams-donkey-unlocking-spiritual.html">Balaam’s donkey</a> revealed a reactive aspect of consciousness that could perceive truth unseen by the master, the colt represents readiness and discipline. The integration here is seamless: awareness directs the faculties of self to participate fully in the work of imagination.<p></p><p></p><h2><strong>Mentioned in All Four Gospels</strong></h2>
The triumphal entry being recorded in all four Gospels highlights its symbolic significance. Each <a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Gospel captures a trained aspect of consciousness</a>, and the repeated mention signals that the activation and alignment of disciplined self is universal within the mind. It is a stage that must occur across all streams of awareness (<a href="../scrolls/label-river-series.html">the four rivers of abundance</a>) for manifestation to proceed effectively.<p></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Jesus riding the colt illustrates the union of conscious awareness with a reliable, responsive facet of self. This disciplined aspect, previously untrained by external influences, is now fully available to carry the realised state. The repeated presence in all four Gospels underscores that this integration is a foundational stage in consciousness—a moment when the faculties are aligned, ready, and capable of sustaining the fulfilled state of imagination.</p>
