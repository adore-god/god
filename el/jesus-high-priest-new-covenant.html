<h1>Paul: Jesus, High Priest of a Better Covenant</h1>

<img  alt="Jesus Priest Icon" src="../images/wp/jesus-priest.webp">
<p>Hebrews 8 speaks of <strong><a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> as the <a href="../scrolls/label-true-priest-melchizedek.html">high priest</a> of a new covenant</strong>, contrasting Him with the old Levitical priesthood. From a Neville Goddard perspective, this chapter is not about historical events but about <strong>states of being and the <a href="../ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">law of assumption</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>The High Priest and the I AM</h3>
<p>The chapter opens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have such a high priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, a minister in the sanctuary and true tabernacle that the Lord set up, not man” (Hebrews 8:1-2).</p>
</blockquote>
In Neville’s interpretation, Jesus represents the <a href="../the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">I AM actively within you</a>—the consciousness that mediates between imagination and experience. The “high priest” symbolizes the state of consciousness capable of <a href="../genesis-111-seed.html">manifesting your inner assumptions into outer reality</a>. Being “seated at the right hand of the throne” indicates that this awareness has dominion over imagined states once it rests in recognition of its own creative power.
<p>The old covenant—Levitical laws, priesthood, and sacrifices—represents reliance on <strong>external rules, religious dogma, or self-condemnation</strong>. These external systems attempt to correct life through effort or ritual rather than through awareness. The new covenant, however, is <strong>internal</strong>, living from the end through assumption, <a href="../scrolls/label-true-priest-melchizedek.html">where imagination itself becomes the high priest</a>.</p>
<h3>The New Covenant: Internal Law</h3>
<p>Hebrews 8 cites Jeremiah 31:31-34, promising a covenant <strong>“written on the heart.”</strong> Neville emphasises this point: the new law is <strong>internalised</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will put My laws into their minds and write them on their hearts… and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that <strong>your inner assumption determines your outer reality</strong>, freeing you from past failures or outer circumstances. The new covenant is the awareness that your imagination shapes experience. Once you live as if your desire is fulfilled, the results follow naturally.</p>
<h3>Why the Bible Isn’t Always Clearly Internal</h3>
<p>Some may wonder: if the Bible is about consciousness, why doesn’t it state this explicitly from the start? Neville explains that <strong>the Bible is progressively teaching consciousness</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Early chapters appear external:</strong> Genesis and Exodus use physical imagery—people, places, events—to convey internal truths in narrative form. Adam and Eve, the Garden, Cain and Abel—these are states of consciousness, represented externally for the reader to grasp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Progression toward internal language:</strong> As the Bible advances, especially in the New Testament, it speaks directly about <strong>living from the end, assuming fulfillment, and accessing the I AM within</strong>. Hebrews 8 is a clear marker: the covenant is now <strong>internal</strong>, written on hearts, no external ritual needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The internal is always present:</strong> Even when the narrative seems external, the events are <strong>shadows of internal processes</strong>, manifestations of consciousness.
</p> <p> 
Hebrews 8:5 calls the earthly tabernacle <a class="noTag aforce" href="../genesis-111-seed.html">“a copy and shadow of the heavenly things,”</a> pointing to the principle that what we see outside is a reflection of what already exists within consciousness. Neville interprets this as a direct lesson in imagination: the physical world is merely a shadow of inner acts of awareness. This echoes Genesis 1:11, where “the earth brings forth vegetation…whose seed is in itself.” <a class="noTag aforce" href="../genesis-111-seed.html">The seed represents the creative act of imagination—planted within, it inevitably manifests outwardly.</a> In both passages, the Bible emphasises that true <a class="noTag aforce" href="../genesis-1-creation.html">creation</a> begins internally, and the visible world simply mirrors the unseen reality of our consciousness.
</p> <p> 
Genesis is no less internal than Hebrews; it simply presents the law of consciousness in story form.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Living the New Covenant</h3>
<p>From a Neville perspective, Hebrews 8 teaches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop relying on external rules or rituals. Awaken to the I AM within. Let your imagination, assumed as real, mediate your life. This is the new covenant: internal, conscious, and alive. Your assumptions, once felt as real, create the results promised by the “better covenant.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the chapter is not a call to literal obedience or historical study—it is an instruction to <strong>assume the fulfilled state and let imagination govern your experience</strong>. The old covenant represented effort and law; the new covenant represents consciousness and creation.</p>
