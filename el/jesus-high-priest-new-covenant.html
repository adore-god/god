<h1>Paul: Jesus, High Priest of a Better Covenant</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<img alt="Jesus Priest Icon" src="../images/wp/jesus-priest.webp">

<p>
Hebrews chapters 7 through the end of chapter 9 are not theological arguments about religion, ritual, or divine favour.
They are a precise psychological description of how the human mind approaches consciousness, worth, and identity — and
how that approach must change for peace to appear.
</p>

<p>
Read psychologically, Hebrews explains the transition from self-judgement and effort to direct identity with <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html"><em>I AM</em></a>.
This aligns exactly with Neville Goddard’s teaching that imagination and awareness are the creative power, and that peace
comes not from correction but from assumption.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>What “the priesthood” means psychologically</h2>

<p>
In Neville’s framework, a <strong>priest</strong> is not a person.
A <a href="../levi-levites-aaron-and-jesus-symbolism.html">priest symbolises the <strong>inner mediator</strong></a> — the method by which the mind approaches its own awareness.
</p>

<p>
Whenever Hebrews speaks about priests, priesthoods, or priestly access, it is describing <strong>how consciousness is
approached</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The question Hebrews is addressing is simple:
<em>How does the mind relate to <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM?</a></em>
</p>

<hr >

<h2>Hebrews 7 — Why the old priesthood had to change</h2>

<p>
“If perfection were through the Levitical priesthood…”
</p>

<p>
Psychologically, the <strong>Levitical priesthood</strong> represents:
</p>

<ul>
<li>External effort</li>
<li>Rules and regulation</li>
<li>Self-improvement as a path to peace</li>
<li>Constant self-measurement and correction</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hebrews states that if this approach worked, nothing new would be required.
But it did not work — not because people failed, but because the system itself was flawed.
</p>

<p>
Neville expresses the same idea differently:
<em>You cannot reach peace by fixing the outer man.</em>
</p>

<p>
Therefore, Hebrews concludes that the law must change — not morality, but <strong>method</strong>.
The way the mind approaches awareness must be transformed.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>Melchizedek — the new priesthood</h2>

<p>
Melchizedek appears without genealogy, history, or qualification.
Psychologically, this symbolises <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html"><strong>direct relationship with I AM</strong></a>.
</p>

<p>
There is no process, no lineage, and no earning.
Awareness does not need permission to be itself.
</p>

<p>
In Neville’s terms, this is the shift from seeking God to <strong>awakening as God</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The new priesthood represents:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Assumption instead of effort</li>
<li>Identity instead of behaviour</li>
<li>Being instead of earning</li>
</ul>

<hr >

<h2>Hebrews 8 — The covenant is internal</h2>

<p>
“I will write my laws in their minds and in their hearts.”
</p>

<p>
This is not a promise of new rules.
It is a description of a <strong>new operating system of consciousness</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The old covenant depended on external correction and continual self-evaluation.
The new covenant describes consciousness creating experience directly, without intermediaries.
</p>

<p>
Neville states this plainly:
<em>The law is not something you obey. It is something you use.</em>
</p>

<hr >

<h2>Hebrews 9 — The holy place explained psychologically</h2>

<p>
The tabernacle described in Hebrews 9 is not a building.
It is the structure of the mind.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Outer court</strong> — the sensory world, appearances, and effort</li>
<li><strong>Holy place</strong> — thinking, imagining, reasoning</li>
<li><strong>Most holy place</strong> — pure awareness (I AM)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Under the old system, the priest could not remain in the Most Holy Place.
He entered briefly, with fear, ritual, and distance.
</p>

<p>
Psychologically, this describes a mind that approaches awareness with guilt and separation —
“God there, me here.”
</p>

<hr >

<h2>Why only the high priest entered — and only once a year</h2>

<p>
This symbolises rare moments of clarity or relief.
Temporary peace rather than stable rest.
</p>

<p>
In modern terms, this looks like brief spiritual insight followed by a return to self-judgement.
Hebrews is explaining that this structure keeps the mind divided.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>“Blood” — what it really means</h2>

<p>
Blood is not violence.
Blood symbolises <strong>life and feeling</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Animal blood represents borrowed feeling — external substitutes for inner conviction.
Christ’s blood represents <strong>your own felt assumption</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Neville teaches:
<em>Feeling is the secret.</em>
</p>

<p>
The sacrifice is not punishment.
It is the release of an old identity.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>“Christ entered the holy place once for all”</h2>

<p>
This is not a historical event.
It is a psychological shift.
</p>

<p>
Consciousness no longer moves in and out of worthiness.
Awareness rests permanently in I AM.
</p>

<p>
The veil is gone.
Separation collapses.
The mind stops prosecuting itself.
</p>

<hr >

<h2>The end of repetition — Hebrews 9 explained</h2>

<p>
“Not that he should offer himself repeatedly…”
</p>

<p>
Psychologically, this means:
</p>

<ul>
<li>You stop trying to fix yourself</li>
<li>You stop rehearsing guilt</li>
<li>You stop sacrificing again and again</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because identity has shifted.
The old self is not destroyed — it is simply no longer occupied.
</p>

<p>
As Neville says:
<em>You do not destroy the old man. You cease to occupy him.</em>
</p>

<hr >

<h2>The central message of Hebrews 7–9</h2>

<p>
Hebrews chapters 7 through 9 describe the end of self-judgement as a method of consciousness
and the beginning of direct identity with I AM through assumption.
</p>

<p>
No priests.
No rituals.
No striving.
</p>

<p>
Only awareness knowing itself.
