<h1>Jesus Did Not Save the World</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Most people hear that <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus came to “save the world”</a> and take this to mean all of mankind, outwardly and historically. But in Scripture, the “world” he rejects is not creation itself — it is the realm of appearances, the false show of facts that bind a man to limitation. When he declares, <em>“My kingdom is not of this world”</em> (John 18:36), he is making plain that his work has nothing to do with preserving appearances, but everything to do with unveiling what is hidden within.</p><p><a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Salvation</a>, then, is not collective and external but deeply personal and inward. Jesus does not patch up the old order of appearances; he unmasks it. His rejection of the world is his refusal to bow to the evidence of sense. As John writes, </p><p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“Have no love for the world or for the things which are in the world… And the world and its desires is coming to an end: but he who does God's pleasure is living for ever”</em> — 1 John 2:15, 17</blockquote><p></p><p>What he saves is the inner man, the true self that has slept under the weight of illusion.</p><p>The crucifixion is not a payment to appease an offended God, but the <a href="../ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">fixing of an assumption </a>— the deliberate death to appearances. And the resurrection is not a future cosmic event, but the present rising of consciousness into a new state. As Isaiah puts it,</p><blockquote>“Give no thought to the things which are past; let the early times go out of your minds. See, I am doing a new thing; now it is starting; will you not take note of it?” — Isaiah 43:18–19 </blockquote><p>In this way, <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus did not save the world of appearances; he revealed the pattern of salvation</a>, showing every man how to awaken from it.</p>
