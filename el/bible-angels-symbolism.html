<h1>Angels in the Bible: The Preparatory Work Leading to Christ</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The Bible presents angels in countless passages, portraying them as powerful, mysterious, and often engaged in battles or delivering divine guidance. From a conventional reading, these beings appear external to humanity, executing God’s will across the physical and spiritual realms. In Hebrews, <a href="../paul-nature-of-angels.html">Paul emphasises the elevated role of Christ above angels</a>, implicitly framing angelic activity as subordinate and preparatory, a foreshadowing of the fully realised conscious faculty in man. Neville Goddard’s teachings illuminate these narratives as <strong>allegories of consciousness in action</strong>. Every angelic intervention — messenger, protector, minister, or warrior — represents <strong>facets of imagination working toward the ultimate human capacity to create consciously</strong>, which Christ embodies.</p><p>In this framework, the biblical “wars” and interventions are not ends in themselves; they are <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html"><strong>the preparatory work of consciousness</strong> that culminates in the emergence of the fully awakened imaginative faculty, <strong>Christ</strong></a>.</p><hr><h2>Messengers (Mal'ak/Angelos) — Revelation of Conscious Possibility</h2><p><strong>Biblical frame:</strong> Angels deliver divine messages, announce births, reveal visions, and guide humanity. Gabriel’s announcements to Mary (Luke 1:26–38) and the angelic warnings to Lot (Genesis 19) are prime examples.</p><p><strong>Goddardian interpretation:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Angels as messengers are <strong>imaginative faculties bringing awareness of a higher state</strong> to consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Birth announcements represent <strong>the emergence of new creative potential within the mind</strong>, the seed of the fulfilled state appearing in imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guidance through warnings or instructions (Lot, Peter) demonstrates <strong>imagination alerting consciousness to pathways that preserve alignment with the desired end</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Key point:</strong> These messengers prepare the mind to recognise and assume the fulfilled state. Christ embodies the culmination of this awareness: a conscious, living ability to manifest reality intentionally.</p><hr><h2>Protectors and Deliverers — Sustaining the Assumed End</h2><p><strong>Biblical frame:</strong> Angels protect individuals and nations — Daniel in the lions’ den (Daniel 6), Elisha’s servant seeing angelic armies (2 Kings 6), Hagar and Ishmael in the wilderness (Genesis 21).</p><p><strong>Goddardian interpretation:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Angels as protectors symbolise <strong>the inner stabilising power of imagination</strong>, sustaining consciousness in a state aligned with the fulfilled desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miraculous deliverances illustrate <strong>how sustained assumption shields consciousness from fear, doubt, and limiting beliefs</strong>, which are the real threats to manifestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psalm 34:7’s encamping angel reflects <strong>the protective presence of a focused, faithful imaginative state</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Key point:</strong> This “protection” is now accessible consciously — with Christ, imagination itself guards the assumed end.</p><hr><h2>Agents of Judgment and Execution — Inner Corrective Forces</h2><p><strong>Biblical frame:</strong> Angels execute judgment — destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19), the angel of death during the Passover (Exodus 12), slaying of Assyrian armies (2 Kings 19).</p><p><strong>Goddardian interpretation:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Angels as executors of wrath represent <strong>the mind’s natural correction when assumptions are misaligned with the desired end</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Judgment” is symbolic of <strong>the internal clearing away of limiting beliefs</strong> — the necessary struggle before consciousness can assume fully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These trials and corrective actions <strong>prepare the mind for the arrival of Christ</strong>, showing that without refinement of consciousness, the power of imagination cannot be fully realised.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Key point:</strong> Judgment angels are not external punishers; they are <strong>stages of consciousness preparing the human mind to wield imagination consciously</strong>.</p><hr><h2>Ministers to God and Man — Reinforcing the Fulfilled State</h2><p><strong>Biblical frame:</strong> Angels worship God, minister to Jesus, and carry souls (Luke 16:22; Matthew 4).</p><p><strong>Goddardian interpretation:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Angels ministering demonstrate <strong>the faculties of imagination sustaining and reinforcing the assumed reality</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The angels attending Jesus after the wilderness temptation or in Gethsemane illustrate <strong>the mind supporting itself when aligned with the fulfilled state</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carrying Lazarus’ soul symbolises <strong>imagination elevating dormant potential into conscious awareness</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Key point:</strong> These ministering roles depict the <strong>internal sustaining of the assumed end</strong>, which becomes fully accessible through Christ — no external angel required.</p><hr><h2>Hierarchical Beings and Spiritual Warfare — Structured Powers of Consciousness</h2><p><strong>Biblical frame:</strong> Archangels (Michael), cherubim, seraphim, and angelic armies engage in cosmic battles (Daniel 10, Revelation 12).</p><p><strong>Goddardian interpretation:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Angels in hierarchical roles are <strong>layers of consciousness organised to manifest reality</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spiritual warfare reflects <strong>the ongoing battle between aligned imagination and subconscious resistances</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a class="aforce" href="../michael-archangel-every-appearance-in.html">Michael’s</a> confrontation with the devil represents <strong>higher awareness confronting lower, limiting beliefs</strong>, clearing the way for conscious creation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Key point:</strong> The “war” is internal; Christ embodies the resolution — the fully awakened imagination that no longer needs to struggle, because the battle is won in consciousness itself.</p><hr><h2>Characteristics of Angels — Attributes of Imagination</h2><p><strong>Biblical frame:</strong> Spirit beings, immortal, intelligent, powerful, obedient, holy, not to be worshipped.</p><p><strong>Goddardian interpretation:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>These traits describe <strong>the ideal operational qualities of imagination</strong>: eternal (immortal), intelligent (aware of possibilities), powerful (creative), obedient (aligned with the law of assumption), holy (pure, uncorrupted by doubt).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prohibition of worship signals <strong>the recognition that the creative faculty is internal</strong>, not an external deity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Key point:</strong> Angels are <strong>manifestations of imagination acting in perfect alignment</strong>, and through Christ, these faculties are consciously accessible to man.</p><hr><h2>Conclusion: Christ as the Fulfillment of Angelic Work</h2><p>Every angelic role in the Bible — messenger, protector, minister, warrior — is <strong>preparatory work for consciousness</strong>, shaping it through trials, guidance, and correction.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The battles, judgments, and interventions train the mind to recognise <strong>the inner faculty of imagination</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Christ represents the <strong>culmination of this inner work</strong>, demonstrating that the human mind can now <strong>assume and sustain the fulfilled state consciously</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Goddardian terms, the war is over <strong>for those who assume the end</strong>, because the faculties that once acted invisibly as angels are now consciously engaged in the service of creation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Ultimate Insight:</strong> The Bible’s angelic narratives are a map of consciousness in action, leading inevitably to the realization that <strong>all power resides within — Christ is the conscious application of imagination, making the fulfilled state tangible in human life</strong>.</p>
