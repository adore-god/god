<h1>Feel the Peace, Hope, and Love the Bible Has Always Promised—Now</h1>

<blockquote> 
“For I know the thoughts I think toward you, says the  Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.” — Jeremiah 29:11
</blockquote> 

<blockquote> 
“May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.” — Romans 15:13
</blockquote> 

<p>The Bible offers a profound source of peace, hope, and love, but these qualities do not originate from an external God delivering promises. Instead, they arise from the consciousness of <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM that I AM”</a>—the self-aware presence within that Neville Goddard describes as shaping reality through the freedom of imagination. When we live as if our desires are already fulfilled, just as Jesus modelled through his <a href="../advanced-mastery-of-manifestation-part.html">instantaneous healings</a>, peace, hope, and love are not distant ideals; they become real and present within the mind.</p>

<blockquote> 
“You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you.” — Isaiah 26:3
</blockquote> 

<p>The Bible begins by illustrating the ultimate expression of peace, hope, and love in the first seven days of creation. <a href="../genesis-1-creation.html">Portraying the clearest example of pure assumption</a> before doubt sets in, each day is an imaginative act, an unfolding of reality from assumption. God, meaning <strong><a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">'Judges' and 'Rulers' of 'I AM THAT I AM'</a> (Genesis 1 and Exodus 3:14)</strong>, <a href="../peace-and-rest-in-song-of-solomon.html">“rests” on the seventh day in recognition that the imagined order has been fully assumed and is good</a>. This demonstrates that ultimate peace and hope are experienced the moment the assumption is fixed and <a href="../genesis-224-love.html">cleaved to in consciousness</a>, and love is the natural expression of that fulfilled state.</p>

<p>This transformation is often subtle but visible. Cain’s countenance, for example, changed to anger when his mind aligned with the futility of the world and a belief in outer causation. Peace, hope, and love are human emotions experienced in the mind, and the Bible continuously addresses the state of consciousness. Cain’s response illustrates that our emotional experience is shaped by inner alignment; when consciousness clings to limiting beliefs, love, hope, and peace recede, but when the mind assumes fulfillment, these qualities naturally arise.</p>

<blockquote> 
“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.” — John 14:27
</blockquote> 

<p><a href="../when-frustration-births-faith-hannah.html">Hannah provides a similar illustration</a>: when she assumed the end she desired, her countenance and sadness lifted, replaced by calm, hope, and quiet joy. This visible shift demonstrates how peace and hope naturally emerge when consciousness assumes fulfillment.</p>

<p>The Bible also shows us practical examples of this principle. <a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a> embodies faith in the unseen, trusting even when external evidence is absent. <a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Jacob</a> demonstrates the process of wrestling with the new ideal self, breaking free from limiting thoughts to step fully into a higher consciousness. <a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph</a> exemplifies the power of imagination to overcome obstacles and adversaries, turning challenges into opportunities despite all odds. <a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Judah</a> teaches the recognition of the righteousness of assumption, understanding that what is assumed in consciousness aligns with truth and can be relied upon.</p>

<p>By imagining and feeling that our desired outcomes are already real, we cultivate peace, hope, and love in daily life. Simple practices—visualising the fulfilled state, affirming “I AM” statements, or dwelling fully in the end—anchor these principles in consciousness. Love is experienced not as a distant idea, but as the natural expression of an inner state aligned with the fulfilled reality.</p>

<blockquote> 
“And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.” — 1 Corinthians 13:13
</blockquote> 

<p>The Bible, when read through the perspective of assumption, becomes a practical guide for living a life infused with peace, hope, and love. These qualities are not distant promises; they are immediate realities available the moment we assume the end within our awareness. Living from this consciousness transforms both our inner experience and the way we interact with the world.</p>

<p>Peace, hope, and love are already present when we assume them. By recognising the force of our imagination and aligning with it, the fulfillment of desire becomes tangible in our own minds and lives, moment by moment.</p>

<blockquote> 
“Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” — Philippians 4:6‑7
