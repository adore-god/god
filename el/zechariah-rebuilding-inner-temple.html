<h1>Zechariah: Rebuilding the Inner Temple</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The Book of <a href="../scrolls/label-zechariah-series.html">Zechariah</a> symbolises the stage in the individual's journey when the <strong>inner temple</strong> — awareness of being within — begins to be rebuilt after exile in a state of forgetfulness. It marks reconnection to imagination following a long captivity in belief in external power.</p>
<h2>Return from Exile</h2>
<p>Zechariah follows the return from Babylon, which represents the soul’s emergence from <em>confusion</em> — a state where man believes the outer world holds power over him. The rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple reflects the <strong>restoration of inner faith in imagination</strong> as the true creative force.</p>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, Babylon symbolises the condition of inner disorder — thought turned outward. To return from Babylon is to bring awareness back within, to remember that “the Kingdom of God is within you.”</p>
<h2>Not by Might, nor by Power</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Zechariah 4:6 </strong><br/>
“Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of armies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the book’s central message. Creation and restoration do not come through effort or external action but by the quiet movement of <strong>Spirit — imagination</strong>. The Spirit rebuilds the inner temple when man turns inward and lives from his assumption of being.</p>
<blockquote> 
The meaning of the "Spirit" is the mental posture you assume, moment to moment — Genesis 1:26
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Zerubbabel</strong> represents the awakened directive self — the builder who lays the foundation of the new consciousness. The <strong>Temple</strong> symbolises awareness itself, and the <strong>Spirit</strong> is the imagination — the creative power that animates every form of life.</p>
<h2>Visions of Awakening</h2>
<p>Zechariah’s visions depict the stirring of divine imagination after dormancy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Man among the Myrtle Trees</strong> – the divine observer awakening in the midst of humble beginnings.</li>
<li><strong>The Golden Lampstand</strong> – illumination and renewed clarity of inner thought.</li>
<li><strong>Joshua the High Priest</strong> – the cleansing of self-image, where “filthy garments” (false concepts of self) are removed and replaced with clean raiment — a new identity aligned with divine awareness.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../zechariah-5-symbolic-purification-for.html">The Flying Roll</a></strong> – thought purified, lifted to its creative purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Coming King</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Zechariah 9:9</strong><br/>
“Be full of joy, O daughter of Zion; give a loud cry, O daughter of Jerusalem: see, your king comes to you, upright and full of salvation, gentle, and seated on an ass.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prophecy — later mirrored in the Gospels — symbolises the entry of <strong>meek imagination</strong> into dominion. The <a href="jesus-riding-donkey.html">King upon a donkey represents mastery that is inward</a>, peaceful, and certain. Dominion here does not come through force but through <em>assumed identity</em> — imagination now ruling quietly within.</p>
<h2>The Spiritual Message</h2>
<p>Zechariah’s theme is <strong>rebuilding the inner temple</strong> through the Spirit of imagination. Every image — the lampstand, the temple, the priest, and the king — points to the <strong>restoration of divine awareness within man</strong>.</p>
<p>Where Haggai calls for the rebuilding of the temple in command, Zechariah provides the inner vision to sustain it. Together they mark the transition from obedience to <em>illumined understanding</em>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>Zechariah represents the awakening and rebuilding of divine imagination.</strong> It is the call to restore dominion within, to replace confusion with clarity, and to let Spirit — not effort — be the builder. The once-ruined consciousness becomes a living temple of the “I AM.”</p>
<p>In the progression of consciousness throughout scripture, Zechariah stands as the herald of full awakening — the rebuilding complete, the inner King soon to be revealed as Jesus, the embodiment of realised divine identity.</p>
