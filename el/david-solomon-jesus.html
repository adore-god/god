<blockquote>
David is the heart of the wish fulfilled. Solomon is the peaceful and wealthy consciousness born from it.
</blockquote>

<p>In the Bible’s inner drama, David and Solomon are not two men separated by generations, but two successive states of consciousness within you. <a href="../the-door-shepherd-and-beloved-exploring.html">David is the heart in love with its vision—the <em>Beloved</em></a>, the one who feels himself to be what he desires to be. Solomon is the peace that follows once that love has fulfilled its course.</p>

<p><a href="../the-door-shepherd-and-beloved-exploring.html">David, whose name means “beloved”</a>, represents the emotional union with the unseen reality. He is the heart that dares to love an invisible thing as though it were visible. When Neville Goddard says that assumption is the bridge of incidents, David is that assumption in motion—the movement of love toward its own likeness. It is not a striving, but a feeling state: the heart enthroned in what it imagines.</p>

<p>From that heart comes Solomon. His name, from <em>Shalom</em>, means peace, wholeness, completeness. He is the son of love—the offspring of a heart that has <a href="../peace-and-rest-in-song-of-solomon.html">already accepted fulfilment</a>. Where David fought battles to secure his throne, Solomon reigned in rest. This shift is inner: once the heart has fully identified with its ideal, the mind no longer wars against appearances. It becomes wealthy, not merely in possessions, but in perception—seeing all things as proceeding from within.</p>

<p>Solomon’s wisdom, too, is born of that <a href="../peace-and-rest-in-song-of-solomon.html">inner rest</a>. Wisdom in the biblical sense is not intellect, but understanding born of love’s completion. The heart that has known fulfilment sees rightly, because it sees from the end. His famed wealth is symbolic of spiritual abundance—the effortless flow of manifestation when the divided mind is reconciled.</p>

<p>Thus the story unfolds within you: first comes David, the heart of love assuming the end; then Solomon, the peace and wealth that love produces. When you have felt your desire real and rest in that awareness, you have entered the kingdom of Solomon—the realm of fulfilled vision where everything is ordered by wisdom and peace.</p>

<h3>Jesus: The Fulfilment of Love and Peace</h3>
<p>Yet the story does not end with Solomon. Out of the line of David and Solomon arises <a href="../jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a>—the Word made flesh. In Neville Goddard’s teaching, Jesus symbolises the full awakening of consciousness to its divine identity. Where David represents love in union with desire, and Solomon represents peace in fulfilment, Jesus represents the <strong>embodiment</strong> of that realisation. He is the living state of “I AM”, the awareness that has become its assumption.</p>

<p>In you, this is the moment when the imagined state ceases to be imagination alone and becomes your experienced reality. Jesus is that union made visible. He is not striving toward fulfilment, nor resting in it—He <em>is</em> it. The heart (David) and the mind (Solomon) have merged into one being who declares, “Before Abraham was, I AM.” The battles of David and the wisdom of Solomon have both served their purpose: to prepare the way for awareness to know itself as the Creator.</p>

<p>In this way, the biblical lineage reveals a progression of consciousness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>David</strong> — Love imagines. The heart joins itself to what it desires.</li>
<li><strong>Solomon</strong> — Peace understands. The mind rests in fulfilment and sees all as complete.</li>
<li><strong>Jesus</strong> — Awareness becomes. The imagined state takes on flesh and walks as reality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesus is therefore the ultimate expression of the wish fulfilled—when love and peace unite as one state of being. He represents the point where the dreamer and the dream are one, where imagination no longer seeks its image but lives as it. In this union, God’s name “I AM” becomes the only truth, and the story of David and Solomon finds its fulfilment in consciousness fully awake.</p>

<p><strong>David loves. Solomon understands. Jesus is.</strong></p>
