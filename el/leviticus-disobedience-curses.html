<h1>Leviticus: Disobedience and Curses</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Leviticus 26 is often read as a list of blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. From verse 14 onward, the text outlines a series of escalating punishments that fall upon Israel when they fail to keep the covenant. Taken literally, this section paints a harsh portrait of a wrathful God. Symbolically, however, it reveals the inner workings of consciousness: what happens when <a href="../cain-lamech-and-jesus-psychology-of.html">man forgets or misuses the law of assumption</a>.</p><p>Each “curse” is not divine vengeance but the outworking of states of mind that reject the “<a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>.” The outer imagery—sickness, famine, captivity—represents inner conditions that naturally follow disbelief and self-negation.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Terror, Disease, and Enemies (Leviticus 26:14–17)</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
“But if you will not listen to me… I will bring upon you sudden terror, wasting disease and fever… You will be defeated before your enemies.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Sudden terror</em> = fear and anxiety rising from within, the mind turned against itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Wasting disease</em> = a state of consciousness consumed by doubt, resentment, or despair, which drains creative energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Enemies ruling over you</em> = external circumstances dominate because inner authority has been surrendered.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This first stage shows the beginning of inner disharmony: fear replaces faith, and imagination breeds enemies of its own making.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Futile Labour and Barren Land (Leviticus 26:18–20)</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
“If after all this you will not listen… I will break down your stubborn pride… Your strength will be spent in vain, your land will not yield its crops, nor the trees their fruit.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Strength spent in vain</em> = effort without imagination. Hard work that yields nothing because the seed is not planted inwardly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Land not yielding</em> = the subconscious unresponsive when no assumption is impressed upon it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Trees without fruit</em> = creative faculties unused, barren of results.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Here, the futility of outer action without inner conviction is highlighted.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Wild Beasts (Leviticus 26:21–22)</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
“If you walk contrary to me… I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children, destroy your cattle and make you so few in number your roads will be deserted.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Wild animals</em> = the untamed beast mind, subconscious fears and instincts running rampant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Robbing children</em> = loss of cherished ideas or visions because imagination is dominated by fear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Destroying cattle</em> = destruction of resources and vitality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Deserted roads</em> = blocked pathways of opportunity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>When imagination is not mastered, the “beast” of the subconscious consumes creation.</p><hr/><h2><strong>The Sword and Broken Staff of Bread (Leviticus 26:23–26)</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
“If you remain hostile… I will bring the sword upon you… When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and you will eat but not be satisfied.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em><a class="aforce" href="../sword-symbolism-neville-goddard-style.html">Sword</a></em> = destructive mental activity—critical, cutting thoughts that divide and wound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bread cut off</em> = lack of spiritual nourishment, the word of faith not feeding the soul.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ten women baking in one oven</em> = many efforts toward fulfilment all converging in a single source of lack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Eating but not satisfied</em> = pursuing outer satisfactions without inner assumption; the hunger never ends.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This section portrays the inner starvation of a life without imaginative vision.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Devastation and Scattering (Leviticus 26:27–33)</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
“If you will not listen… I will lay waste your cities… I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out my sword and pursue you.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Cities laid waste</em> = collapse of structured thought, the mind in disarray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sanctuaries destroyed</em> = loss of inner reverence, the holy place within defiled by doubt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Scattering among nations</em> = divided mind, pulled in many directions, lacking inner unity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sword pursuing</em> = unrelenting destructive thought-chains following wherever you go.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This stage shows total fragmentation of consciousness, where unity of “I Am” is lost.</p><hr/><h2><strong>The Land Enjoys Its Sabbaths (Leviticus 26:34–39)</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
“Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the time it lies desolate… Those who are left will waste away in their enemies’ lands because of their sins.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Land resting</em> = the subconscious withdraws, no longer producing, lying dormant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Desolation</em> = the absence of fruitful imagination leaves only emptiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Wasting away in enemies’ lands</em> = a state of being consumed by foreign thoughts—beliefs not your own, borrowed assumptions that drain life.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the picture of spiritual exile: man living entirely under conditions created by disbelief.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Confession and Covenant Remembered (Leviticus 26:40–46)</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
“But if they will confess their sins… I will remember my covenant with Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham… For their sake I will remember the covenant.”
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Confession</em> = recognising the misuse of imagination, acknowledging “I created this.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>God remembering His covenant</em> = the eternal law of assumption remains true, unbroken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a class="aforce" href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham, Isaac, Jacob</a></em> = faith, promise, persistence—all stages of consciousness that secure restoration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The passage ends not in wrath but in restoration: once man recognises the law at work, the same principle that appeared as “punishment” becomes the means of renewal.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Leviticus 26:14–46 symbolically outlines the descent of consciousness when imagination is denied or misused. Each curse is a picture of inner disorder: fear, futility, loss, fragmentation, and exile. Yet the covenant is never destroyed—it is always waiting to be remembered.</p><p>In Neville’s terms, the passage is not a threat but a map: it shows what happens when man lives without assumption, and how even despair drives him back to the creative law within—“I AM.”</p>
