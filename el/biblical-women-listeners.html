<h1>Women in the Bible: Listening and Taking to Heart</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The Bible often presents women in roles of listening, observing, and taking events or messages to heart. These passages suggest a focus on internal reception and reflection.</p>

<h3>Queen of Sheba</h3>
<blockquote>
“She came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind.” — 1 Kings 10:2
</blockquote>
<p>The Queen of Sheba seeks wisdom and engages thoughtfully, reflecting an attentive and receptive state.</p>

<h3>Rebekah</h3>
<blockquote>
“Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and she became his wife; and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.” — Genesis 24:67
</blockquote>
<p>Rebekah is portrayed as entering a space of observation and alignment, emphasising listening and internal understanding.</p>

<blockquote>
“Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau, her elder son; and Esau went out to the field to hunt for food for him.” — Genesis 27:5
</blockquote>
<p>Rebekah demonstrates careful attention, listening to what is said before taking any action. Her role here shows internal reception and consideration, consistent with the pattern of women in scripture being attentive and reflective.</p>

<h3>Mary, Mother of Jesus</h3>
<blockquote>
“But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.” — Luke 2:19
</blockquote>
<p>Mary demonstrates reflection and careful contemplation, keeping the information within her mind and heart.</p>

<h3>Other Examples</h3>

<blockquote>
“And his words came to the ears of Sarah who was at the back of the tent-door.” — Genesis 18:10
</blockquote>
<p>Sarah observes and responds internally to God’s promise about Isaac, showing inward processing before outward expression.</p>

<blockquote>
“Hannah was praying in her heart; and her lips moved, but her voice was not heard.” — 1 Samuel 1:13
</blockquote>
<p>Hannah prays silently, demonstrating internal focus and devotion.</p>

<blockquote>
“Mary took her seat at the Lord’s feet and listened to his words; Martha was busy with serving.” — Luke 10:39
</blockquote>
<p>Mary chooses to listen attentively while <a href="../the-master-is-here.html">Martha performs tasks, highlighting inner attention as a priority</a>.</p>

<h3>Paul’s Instruction</h3>
<blockquote>
Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. — 1 Corinthians 14:34–35
</blockquote>

<p>Paul’s teaching that women should not speak in church aligns with this inner pattern seen throughout scripture. The emphasis is on stillness, reflection, and inner devotion rather than outward expression. “The church” represents the <a href="../elohim-god.html"> gathered states of mind</a>, and silence signifies inward listening to the voice of awareness itself.</p>

<p>When <a href="../the-mystery-secret-bible-revealed.html">Paul</a> says women should ask their own husbands at home, he points to the union described in Genesis 2:24 — <a href="../genesis-224-love.html">“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife...”</a> The husband represents the conscious assumption, the <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">‘I AM’</a> with which the receptive aspect of mind unites. The instruction is psychological: do not seek answers outwardly, but return inward to your <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">‘I AM’ assumed identity — your husband</a> — and receive understanding there.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Women in the Bible are consistently portrayed as figures of listening and taking messages to heart. Their role emphasises internal reflection, careful observation, and devoted attention, which reflects the psychological principle of receiving, integrating, and maintaining focus on what is true or important within consciousness.</p>
