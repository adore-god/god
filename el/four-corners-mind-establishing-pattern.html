<h1>The Four Corners of the Mind Establishing the Pattern</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."</em></blockquote><p></p><p>Seen symbolically, this is the <a href="../elohim-god.html">rhythm of <strong>consciousness itself</strong></a>. Leaving represents stepping away from old habits, inherited beliefs, or fixed states of mind. Cleaving represents uniting with a new awareness — the mind integrating itself.</p><p>Scripture and the <a href="../why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">Gospels</a> are this process <strong><a href="../genesis-126-man.html">made visible as dialogue</a></strong>. They are not separate histories; they are <strong><a href="../creating-with-scripture-word-of-god-and.html">the mind conversing with itself</a></strong>, each corner of consciousness speaking its own truth so that the whole may be realised.</p><h2>Four Conversations, One Mind</h2><ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Matthew</a></strong>: The mind recognising structure, lineage, and order. Anchoring in the past to navigate the present (Matthew 1:1–17 shows the lineage of Jesus — the mind acknowledging its foundation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Mark</a></strong>: The mind in direct action, confronting experience head-on. Mark 1:17: <em>“Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men”</em> — the voice of consciousness stepping actively into life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Luke</a></strong>: The mind reflecting, observing, weaving detail, and exploring relationships. Luke 2:19: <em>“But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart”</em> — reflective inner conversation, observing experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="../teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">John</a></strong>: The mind returning to its source, speaking in poetic discourse, moving in and out of the Father. John 6:56: <em>“He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him”</em>; John 14:20: <em>“At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you”</em>. These passages illustrate the cyclical dialogue of leaving and returning, of separation and unity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Each <a href="../why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">Gospel</a> is <strong>a corner of the mind speaking</strong>, and together they form the complete inner conversation — the mind discovering, leaving, and reuniting with itself.</p><h2>John: The Inner Dialogue of Return</h2><p><a href="../scrolls/label-john-series.html">John’s</a> repeated themes of <strong>“going away and coming again”</strong> (John 14:18: <em>“I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you”</em>) show this process most clearly. They are not merely narratives about external events; they are <strong>conversations within consciousness</strong>, teaching the mind how to navigate its own exploration and reintegration. Being “in the Father and out of the Father” is the pulse of imagination: the mind expanding, contracting, leaving and returning. John 15:4: <em>“Abide in me, and I in you”</em> reinforces this cyclical union, showing the dynamic relationship of self and source.</p><h2>Weaving Consciousness</h2><p>When you read the Gospels as internal dialogue, everything clicks: each story, each discourse, each teaching is a <strong>strand in the mind’s own weaving</strong>. The four Gospels are four corners of this weave, showing the full pattern of how consciousness establishes itself, explores, and integrates.</p><p>Genesis 2:24 is the blueprint. The mind leaves its old states and cleaves to the new, <a href="../elohim-god.html"> uniting its fragmented voices into one living, breathing conversation</a>: the mind fully awake, fully conscious, fully itself. </p><p>These discourses are example conversations that you will ultimately be having <a href="../ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">with yourself</a> as you fuse with the law of Assumption</p>
