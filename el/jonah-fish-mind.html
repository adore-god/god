<h1>Jonah and the Fish</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The story of <a href="../scrolls/label-jonah-series.html">Jonah</a> being swallowed by the great fish shows what happens when the mind resists the <a href="../ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assumption of what it wants</a>. Jonah flees from the task he is called to, representing the refusal to assume the state that brings fulfillment.</p>
<h2>Being Swallowed</h2>
<p>The fish represents a consuming mood or inner state. In Scripture, animals, like <a href="../the-lion-rules-domination-and-dominion.html">the lion</a>, symbolise <a href="../elohim-god.html">thoughts, emotions, and mental tendencies that rule as Elohim - imagination</a>. Being swallowed by the fish shows what it is like to be consumed by a dominant mood—fear, anxiety, or doubt—when the inner assumption of fulfillment is not taken. Jonah experiences being overwhelmed, completely immersed in the emotional tide, rather than acting from a consciously assumed state.</p>
<h2>Turning Inward</h2>
<p>Jonah’s prayer inside the fish is the act of returning to the state he wants. By assuming the state of being aligned, fulfilled, and faithful, he changes his relationship to the mood that consumed him. The fish does not punish; it simply reflects the inner state that must be assumed before external reality can respond.</p>
<h2>Emergence</h2>
<p>When Jonah is released onto dry land, it shows the natural result of assumption. Having assumed the desired inner state, he is no longer consumed by moods or fluctuating thoughts. The outer reality now reflects the inner state: Jonah moves from limitation to full engagement with purpose, consuming abundance rather than being consumed by emotional tides.</p>
<h2>The Vine Episode: Mood Default</h2>
<p>After Jonah is delivered from the fish, God (imagination) provides a vine to give him comfort and shade</a>, reminding us of the principles of the <a href="../genesis-111-seed.html">seed in itself</a> and the <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">two trees in the garden of Eden</a>. Yet when the vine withers, Jonah immediately becomes irritated and grumpy again. Psychologically, this shows that outer circumstances do not determine the inner state. Even after being freed from one consuming mood, Jonah falls back into another because he has not yet consciously sustained the assumed state. This reinforces the Law of Assumption: inner alignment must be maintained independently of changing conditions.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The story of Jonah and the fish illustrates the Law of Assumption. The fish represents moods, thoughts, and inner resistance; prayer and assumption transform the inner state; emergence shows the outer world aligning naturally with the assumed state. The vine episode demonstrates that unless the inner state is consciously assumed and maintained, outer changes cannot prevent default reactions. Being swallowed by a fish is being consumed by a mood—but by assuming and sustaining the end, inner states can be mastered and outer reality reflects that mastery.</p>
