<h1>‘The Ends of the Earth’: Fulfilment and Living in the End</h1>

<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The phrase “the ends of the earth” appears throughout Scripture. While many read it as a reference to geography, the Bible uses it to speak of the farthest point, the completed reach, or the fulfilled state of something. This gives the expression natural alignment with what Neville Goddard taught as “living in the end”: holding to the final state within consciousness until it becomes visible.</p>

<p>Several passages explicitly connect God with the “ends of the earth” in ways that reveal fulfilment rather than distance. These verses show God — <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM that I AM</a> — as the author of the completed outcome, not simply the creator of the physical world. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
Isaiah 40:28 — “The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth.”
</blockquote>

<p>This does not only present God as creator of physical extremities. It declares that the end-state itself is His work. Neville taught that imagination forms the end first; the world then adjusts to it. Isaiah’s wording fits naturally with this principle: the end is already established.</p>

<blockquote>
Isaiah 45:22 — “Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth.”
</blockquote>

<p>The call is not to travel somewhere but to return to the already-complete truth. It is an instruction to occupy the fulfilled position inwardly. This mirrors the practical application of <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assumption</a>: turn away from appearances and return to the inner certainty of the completed desire.</p>

<blockquote>
Isaiah 52:10 — “All the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.”
</blockquote>

<p>This is a statement of visibility. What God completes becomes seen everywhere. The passage shows salvation as something already established and waiting to be revealed, just as Neville explains that fulfilment is accepted inwardly before it appears outwardly.</p>

<blockquote>
Psalm 22:27 — “All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord.”
</blockquote>

<p>Again, “the ends of the earth” describes the final point of recognition, the completed understanding. It echoes the idea that the end already exists and that consciousness returns to it.</p>

<blockquote>
Psalm 98:3 — “All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.”
</blockquote>

<p>Here Scripture speaks in the past tense. Fulfilment is described as already accomplished. The Bible often presents the completed act as a finished reality long before it appears historically. Neville highlighted this pattern throughout the Psalms, prophets, and Gospels.</p>

<p>Other references also support this idea indirectly. Psalm 65:5 calls God “the hope of all the ends of the earth,” identifying God with the final outcome. Job 28:24 says He “looks to the ends of the earth,” indicating a perspective of completeness. Even passages often treated as geographical, such as Acts 1:8, carry symbolic weight: the message of fulfilment is taken to its utmost reach.</p>

<p>Together these verses show that Scripture does not treat the “end” as something distant but as something established. The end is a completed point in awareness, and the believer is called to return to it, assume it, and occupy it. This is the essence of what Neville taught: the end is where we begin.</p>

<p>“The ends of the earth” therefore becomes a biblical expression for total fulfilment. It describes the completed result, the final truth, and the state the believer is invited to stand in. When read this way, the connection between the Bible’s language and the practice of assumption becomes clear. Scripture consistently speaks from the standpoint of the fulfilled outcome, showing that the end is already formed, already known, and already held within God.</p>
