<h1>Isaiah — Ask, Believe and Receive</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">
<blockquote>“I gave word in the past of the things which took place … suddenly they came about.” — Isa. 48:3
<br/> <br/> 
“From now I will give word of new things … even secret things of which you had no knowledge. They have come into being only now, and not in the past.” — Isa. 48:6–7
<br/> <br/> 

“Your ears were not open to them in the past … your behaviour was false.” — Isa. 48:8
</blockquote>
<h3>Ask, Believe, Receive — The Hidden Cause</h3>
<blockquote>“Make a request, and it will be answered; let your search be for a thing, and you will get it; give a knock, and the door will be open.” — Matthew 7:7</blockquote>
<blockquote>“For this reason I say to you, Whatever you make a request for in prayer, have faith that it has been given to you, and you will have it.” — Mark 11:24</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Up to now you have made no request to God in my name: make a request and you will get it, so that your joy may be full.” — John 16:24</blockquote>
<p>This law — <a href="../ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">ask, believe, receive</a> — is the hidden heart of Isaiah 48. What Isaiah dramatises is the inner dialogue that makes this <a href="../exodus-314-i-am.html">law operative within the self</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Isaiah as the Inner Prophet</h3>
<p>Isaiah here is not an external figure but the <a href="../genesis-126-man.html">prophet formed within you</a>. His voice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reminds you of past creations.</li>
<li>Declares new possibilities.</li>
<li>Convicts you when the ear remains closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>He is the witness of your own imagination, the inner voice that interprets your states of consciousness.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Former Things Declared — The Receive</h3>
<blockquote>“I gave word in the past of the things which took place … suddenly they came about.” — Isa. 48:3</blockquote>
<p>The “sudden” fulfilment reflects 'living in the end', the receiving stage: what was asked inwardly has clothed itself in fact. This is memory and manifestation at once. Your past assumptions, declared in imagination, are now reality.</p>
<p>Isaiah as inner prophet reminds you: you have always been receiving, whether consciously or not.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>New Things Declared — The Ask</h3>
<blockquote>“From now I will give word of new things … even secret things of which you had no knowledge. They have come into being only now, and not in the past.” — Isa. 48:6–7</blockquote>
<p>This is the asking stage: a <a href="../ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">fresh desire, a hidden assumption, spoken in the mind, created in the present.</a> Neville Goddard teaches that desire itself is the prophecy of its fulfilment.</p>
<p>The “new things” are created in this moment, not from the past. They call the self to engage with imagination consciously.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Witnessing — Imagining the Word</h3>
<blockquote>“Will you not give witness to it?” — Isa. 48:6</blockquote>
<p>Witnessing is the act of imagining the declared word as real. It is not passive observation, but active inner seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The prophet has declared new things.</li>
<li>You must witness: hold them in imagination, take them as already fulfilled.</li>
<li>This bridges ask and receive: imagining is believing in action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Faith is therefore not abstract; it is the mind actively participating in what Isaiah has declared. Witnessing is the practical, imaginative expression of belief.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>The Closed Ear — The Struggle to Believe</h3>
<blockquote>“Your ears were not open to them in the past … your behaviour was false.” — Isa. 48:8</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Have faith that it has been given to you, and you will have it.” — Mark 11:24</blockquote>
<p>The closed ear represents resistance: the self clinging to appearances, treacherous to imagination. Without opening the ear — truly believing and witnessing — the word remains unmanifested.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>The Dialogue of Consciousness</h3>
<p>Isaiah 48 unfolds the inner rhythm of consciousness:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask — new desires arise; the prophet declares them within.</li>
<li>Believe / Witness — imagination sees them as true; the ear opens.</li>
<li>Receive — what is imagined and believed manifests; the “suddenly” occurs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The inner prophet guides this dialogue, showing you the law in operation.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Isaiah 48:3, 6–8 is a dramatization of Jesus’ teaching on ask, believe, receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask — the new things declared in imagination.</li>
<li>Believe — witness them in the mind’s eye; open the inner ear.</li>
<li>Receive — the declared word externalises; the past and new become reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>To hear Isaiah is to hear your own imagination, calling you to participate consciously in the eternal rhythm: “I have declared … I will declare … and it shall come to pass.”</p>
