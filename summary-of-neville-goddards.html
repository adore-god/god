<h1>Summary of Neville Goddard's Interpretation of the Bible</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Neville Goddard’s approach to the Bible focuses on the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>—the principle that you <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">become what you assume</a> and <a href="scrolls/label-feeling-is-the-secret.html">feel yourself to be</a>. His interpretation moves away from historical or theological debate, instead treating scripture as a demonstration of the processes by which our assumptions shape reality.</p>

<h3>Jesus as an Assumed State</h3>
<p>In Goddard’s teaching, <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> isn't a historical figure but a portrayal of a state of being. He embodies the ideal assumed state—a living example of a person fully aligned with the reality they assume. Events in his life, including miracles, <a href="scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html"> crucifixion</a>, and resurrection, are symbols of the inner transformations that occur when one persistently assumes the feeling of the end.</p>

<h3>The Misuse of “Christ Consciousness”</h3>
<p>The term “Christ consciousness” has often led people astray. Many assume it refers to an external divinity or a mystical state to be attained. Neville teaches that it represents the consistent assumption of the state of being that fulfills one’s desires. When correctly understood, it is not something outside of you but the natural expression of imagination sustained and felt as real.</p>

<h3>The Bible as a Manual of Assumptions</h3>
<p>Every character and story in scripture demonstrates how states of consciousness interact and manifest. Jesus is a model of how to sustain an assumed state in the inevitable face of opposition and changing mental landscape. The <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Law of Assumption</a>, as shown through the narrative, is universal: the inner feeling must precede external conditions. Salvation, therefore, is not external but a shift in assumed identity—living fully as the person you wish to be.</p>

<h3>Why Neville Used the Bible</h3>
<p>Neville always drew his teaching from the Bible because his audiences were steeped in scripture. He wanted to show that the Bible itself is not a book of history or external commandments, but a psychological record of states and assumptions. Today, many retellings of his work strip out the biblical context and focus only on the idea of manifestation. While the principle still works, this loses the depth of Neville’s point: the stories of scripture are demonstrations of the Law of Assumption in action, making the <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">invisible principle visible through narrative.</a></p>


<h3>Practical Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus on what you assume and feel yourself to be rather than on external events or labels.</li>
<li>Understand “Christ consciousness” as the natural unfolding of sustained, imagined states—not a mystical title.</li>
<li>The Bible is a practical guide to mastering the art of assumption through repeated, disciplined feeling of the desired reality.</li>
<li>Jesus, and other biblical figures, are examples of living the assumption until it manifests externally.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, Neville reframes all biblical events as <strong>psychological demonstrations of the Law of Assumption</strong>. The key is consistent inner assumption and feeling: when you persist in imagining and feeling the desired state as real, reality conforms to that assumption.</p>
