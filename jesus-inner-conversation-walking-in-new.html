<h1>Jesus’ Inner Conversation: Walking in the New Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><strong>An Interpretation of John 12:27-30</strong></p><p>In John 12:27-30, Jesus expresses deep inner turmoil while also affirming the purpose of his mission. Seen as an inner dialogue between different states of awareness, this passage reveals the process of embracing a new assumption — a key concept in Neville Goddard’s teachings on imagination and consciousness. Jesus’ conversation with “his disciples” can be understood as a symbolic innerconversation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>The Passage (John 12:27-30, NIV)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name!”<br/>
Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.”<br/>
The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><strong>1. Jesus’ Troubled Soul: The Struggle of the Old State</strong></p>
<p>Jesus’ declaration, <em>“Now my soul is troubled,”</em> reflects the natural resistance and fear within the old self. This troubled state represents an inner conflict—the subconscious discomfort before embracing a new assumption of being. It is the tension between clinging to the familiar and stepping into transformation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>2. The Question: The Choice Between Fear and Faith</strong></p>
<p>The question, <em>“What shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’?”</em> captures the pivotal moment of choice in consciousness. The “Father” here symbolizes the higher imagination or divine creative power — the unseen source of transformation. This question is the dialogue between fear of change and the call to faith.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>3. The Affirmation: Embracing the New Assumption</strong></p>
<p>When Jesus replies, <em>“No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour,”</em> he decisively chooses the new assumption. This shift represents acceptance that the moment of transformation is necessary. It reflects persistence and faith in the creative process, embracing the destiny laid out by the imagination.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>4. The Call to Glorify: Aligning with Creative Power</strong></p>
<p><em>“Father, glorify your name!”</em> is a prayer of alignment with the divine power that shapes reality. It is a conscious appeal to the imagination’s creative force to bring the desired reality into manifestation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>5. The Voice from Heaven: Confirmation and Repetition</strong></p>
<p>The voice —  the I AM — from heaven declares, <em>“I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.”</em> This repetition echoes the rhythm of the creation story in Genesis, where God said things twice to establish their reality (e.g., “Let there be light... and there was light”). This echoes the <strong>law of the identical harvest</strong>: what is sown in imagination is faithfully reaped in experience. The voice confirms the new assumption is active and unfolding.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>6. The Crowd: The Outer Mind’s Perception</strong></p>
<p>The crowd’s reaction — hearing thunder or an angel — represents how external awareness or the untransformed mind perceives the inner shifts of consciousness. It shows the contrast between inner certainty and outer confusion or awe.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>John 12:27-30, interpreted as an inner conversation, reveals the crucial steps on the path of manifestation: recognising struggle, choosing faith over fear, and receiving divine confirmation. Jesus’ dialogue with “his disciples” is a metaphor for the imaginative journey towards a new reality. The repeated voice affirms that transformation follows divine law — what is imagined with conviction is realised with certainty.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
