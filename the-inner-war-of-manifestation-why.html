It doesn&rsquo;t go quietly. It panics. It accuses. It drags you back toward &ldquo;fact,&rdquo; toward &ldquo;evidence,&rdquo; toward &ldquo;reason.&rdquo; Why? Because for so long, the outer world has been its <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">master</a>.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You must feel after him and assert that he is in you, even though your senses deny it.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard, &ldquo;He Is Dreaming Now&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote><p>When you begin to imagine yourself as healthy, wealthy, or loved, while all around you says otherwise, you&rsquo;re not just shifting thought&mdash;you&rsquo;re crucifying the old man.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The crucifixion is the fixation of the new man to the cross of the old man. The cross is your own wonderful body.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard, &ldquo;The Mystery of Christ&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s why it hurts. That&rsquo;s why doubts, fears, and memories resurface. It&rsquo;s the dying process&mdash;the subconscious mind resisting the new command. It&rsquo;s not a punishment. It&rsquo;s proof that something new is being born in you.</p><p>Paul understood this inner conflict deeply. He described this pain not merely as frustration, but as a profound groaning:</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time... we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption, the redemption of our bodies.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Romans 8:22&ndash;23 (ESV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This groaning is <a href="the-labour-of-becoming-childbirth.html">spiritual labour</a>. The moment you trust imagination over facts, you are birthing something new. The subconscious groans; the flesh resists. Yet something deeper rejoices.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You slay the giant of doubt with the stone of truth.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>(Neville Goddard, paraphrased)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is your <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-david-series.html">David</a> moment. David, the symbol of your emerging ideal self and the very manifestation you seek to embody, stands ready. The world says your enemy is too big, too real, too impossible. But your inner David knows: one well-aimed assumption, persisted in, will silence every Goliath.</p><p>Paul further reveals the tension between the old and the new self:</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life... and be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and put on the new self, created after the likeness of God.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Ephesians 4:22&ndash;24 (ESV)</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other...&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Galatians 5:17 (ESV)</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him...&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>1 Corinthians 2:14 (ESV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>These passages speak to the subconscious mind&rsquo;s resistance&mdash;the &ldquo;old self&rdquo; clinging to what it knows, even as the new state calls it to transformation.</p><p>Jesus himself experienced mockery and rejection as part of this crucifixion process&mdash;the outward reflection of the inner struggle manifesting in the world:</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, &lsquo;Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself, and come down from the cross!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Mark 15:29&ndash;30 (ESV)</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the same way the chief priests, along with the scribes, mocked him to one another and said, &lsquo;He saved others; he cannot save himself. Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Mark 15:31&ndash;32 (ESV)</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Mark 15:32 (ESV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The mocking voices outside echo the inner doubts and fears seeking to pull you back to your former state. Yet Jesus did not yield. Neither must you.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your present mental conversations do not recede into the past. They advance into your future to confront you as wasted or invested words.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard, &ldquo;Mental Diets&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote><p>So don&rsquo;t let the pain fool you. You&rsquo;re not doing it wrong. You&rsquo;re doing it right. The very resistance you feel is proof the old programming is being confronted. The new state is asserting itself.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When you know what you want, you do not let the evidence of your senses dictate what you will accept as true.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard, &ldquo;Faith&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is the crucifixion. This is the groaning. But it is also the beginning of resurrection.</p><p>Keep going.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
