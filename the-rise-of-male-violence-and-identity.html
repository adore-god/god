<h1>The Rise of Male Violence and the Identity Crisis Behind It: A Biblical and Symbolic Examination</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The tragic acts committed by Axel Rudakubana&mdash;who fatally stabbed three girls and attempted to murder others in Southport in 2024&mdash;reveal a far-reaching crisis. They are not isolated, senseless acts. They are manifestations&mdash;physical outcomes&mdash;of a deep psychological and spiritual distortion now embedded in the collective male identity.</p>
<p>When the Bible is read symbolically, it teaches that all outward conditions arise from inner assumptions. &ldquo;As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.&rdquo; Identity is not inherited&mdash;it is imagined, accepted, and embodied. The violent man is not &ldquo;born that way&rdquo;; he becomes the image he consumes and consents to.</p>
<h3>Propaganda as Assumption: The Modern Influence on Male Identity</h3>
<p>The extreme rise in male violence in society today is not occurring in a vacuum. It is the outpicturing of what has been impressed upon the minds of young men through a constant stream of online propaganda. "Alpha male" podcasts, social media influencers, and ideologies steeped in misogyny and dominance are more than entertainment&mdash;they are instruction.</p>
<p>These platforms teach men that emotion is weakness, that women are threats, and that value lies in control. And because the mind operates by assumption&mdash;that is, it makes real what is believed&mdash;this content is not passive. It is formative. It builds a self-image that must either dominate or disappear.</p>
<p>In biblical symbolism, this is the story of Cain and Abel. Cain (the external man, the ego) rejects Abel (the inner, imaginative self) and kills him. Whenever the imagination is ignored&mdash;whenever a man denies his inner life in favour of performance and control&mdash;violence follows. This violence may be internal at first: numbness, depression, repression. But as these assumptions harden, they manifest outwardly in acts like Axel&rsquo;s.</p>
<h3>The Law of Assumption: Thought Made Flesh</h3>
<p>Scripture describes, in symbolic terms, what today&rsquo;s psychologists are only beginning to articulate: that identity is shaped by belief, and belief shapes behaviour. This is the Law of Assumption. The inner dialogue&mdash;what a man says to himself about himself&mdash;determines how he will act and what he will experience.</p>
<p>When a generation of young men is raised on media that glorifies coldness, contempt for women, and emotional disconnection, we should not be surprised when these beliefs begin to take flesh. The crisis of male violence is not a mystery; it is a harvest.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &ldquo;You shall know them by their fruits.&rdquo; The fruit we are now seeing&mdash;murder, aggression, entitlement, and despair&mdash;is the direct result of what has been planted in the mind.</p>
<h3>Misogyny and the Collapse of the Inner Man</h3>
<p>The symbolic masculine in the Bible represents conscious direction&mdash;agency, decision, the ability to shape reality from within. When this faculty is corrupted by propaganda, it ceases to guide and begins to destroy. The mind, trained by hateful content, turns its power not toward creation but conquest.</p>
<p>The misogyny so widely consumed online is not simply cultural noise&mdash;it is spiritual poison. It kills empathy, distorts self-perception, and separates the man from his own soul. The Bible warns again and again of what happens when men "forget the Lord their God"&mdash;when they forget the true creative centre within. The result is always chaos.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: A Crisis of Imagination</h3>
<p>The rise in male violence is not a political issue. It is not merely sociological. It is a spiritual crisis&mdash;a misdirection of the God-given faculty of imagination. The mind that could build, redeem, and love is instead taught to destroy in order to feel real.</p>
<p>If society continues to allow male self-worth to be formed by propaganda, then violence will not just continue&mdash;it will escalate. If we are to restore the masculine to its rightful role&mdash;as a vessel of inner power and divine direction&mdash;we must teach men again how to assume worth, rather than demand it.</p>
<p>Every act begins in the unseen. And right now, what is unseen in the minds of many is horrifying. But it can be changed. The Bible declares that &ldquo;all things are possible to him who believes.&rdquo; The world changes when belief changes. That change must begin now, with the image we allow young men to consume, and ultimately, to become.</p>
