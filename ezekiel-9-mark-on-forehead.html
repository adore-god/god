<h1>Ezekiel 9: The Mark on the Forehead</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>

<p>In Ezekiel 9, the prophet describes a vivid inner vision. A man clothed in linen, carrying a writing kit, is told to go through Jerusalem and <strong>mark the foreheads</strong> of those who “sigh and cry” over what is taking place there. Those without the mark are removed.</p>

<p>Read psychologically, and in line with <strong>Neville Goddard’s revelation of the law of assumption</strong>, this is not a prophecy of outer destruction but a description of an <strong>inner sorting of states of mind</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Jerusalem: The Teaching of Peace</strong></h2>

<p>Jerusalem means <em>“teaching of peace”</em>, and symbolically it represents the <strong>inner self-imposed doctrine you are living by</strong> — the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">assumptions, beliefs, and self-concepts that govern your experience of life</a>.</p>

<p>When Ezekiel speaks of abominations within Jerusalem, he is not describing immoral behaviour, but <a href="genesis-47-sin.html"><strong>states of mind that contradict peace</strong></a>: fear, resentment, self-pity, effort, and the belief that life is happening <em>to</em> you rather than <em>from</em> you.</p>

<p>This is the mind out of <a href="to-choir-master-what-it-really-means-in.html">harmony</a> with itself.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>The Scribe: Awareness at Work</strong></h3>

<p>The man clothed in linen is not an external angel. He represents the <strong>observing awareness</strong> that begins to move through the mind once a person becomes conscious of the law of assumption.</p>

<p>This “scribe” is the part of you that <strong>notices</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which thoughts are still rooted in misery rather than joy</li>
  <li>Which reactions assume lack instead of fulfilment</li>
  <li>Which inner conversations deny peace</li>
</ul>

<p>In Neville’s terms, this is the moment you stop being identified with every thought and begin to <strong>select states deliberately</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>The Mark on the Forehead: A Change of Assumption</strong></h3>

<p>The forehead symbolises <strong>thinking</strong> — the habitual direction of the mind. To be marked on the forehead is not to be protected from punishment, but to experience a <strong>shift in assumption</strong>.</p>

<p>Those who “sigh and cry” are not victims lamenting the world. They are inner states that recognise:</p>

<p><strong>“This way of thinking is producing suffering.”</strong></p>

<p>The mark is simply this recognition becoming conscious. It is the decision — sometimes quiet, sometimes uncomfortable — to <strong>no longer assume from fear, but from peace</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Sin as Missing the Mark</strong></h3>

<p>In Hebrew, the word often translated as sin — <strong>chata’</strong> — means <strong>“to miss the mark.”</strong></p>

<p>This has nothing to do with morality. It describes a mind that is <strong>assuming wrongly</strong>: <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">imagining against itself</a>, identifying with appearances, and reacting instead of creating.</p>

<p>To “hit the mark” is simply to assume in harmony with what you <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">wish to experience</a>.</p>

<p>Seen this way, the mark in Ezekiel 9 is the <strong>end of missing the mark</strong>. <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">It is the mind learning to rest in chosen assumptions</a> rather than unconscious reactions.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>The Destruction of the Unmarked: States, Not People</strong></h3>

<p>The unmarked are destroyed — but nothing real is lost.</p>

<p>What disappears are <strong>unconscious states</strong>: habitual reactions, identities built on pain, and assumptions that cannot survive awareness.</p>

<p>As Neville repeatedly emphasised, <strong>states pass, but the I AM remains</strong>.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 9 describes the natural consequence of awareness: when you see a state clearly, you can no longer live from it.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Cain and the Contrast of Marks</strong></h3>

<p>This passage quietly mirrors the story of <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Cain and Abel</a>. Cain represents identification with the outer world; Abel represents the imaginal life.</p>

<p>Cain is marked as a sign of unconscious living — a mind driven by appearances. The mark in Ezekiel, however, is the opposite: it signifies a mind that has begun to <strong>live from assumption</strong>.</p>

<p>One mark signals sleep. The other signals awakening.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Conclusion: Living from Peace</strong></h3>

<p>Ezekiel 9 is not a story of judgement, wrath, or exclusion. It is a precise psychological account of what happens when a person becomes aware of how their inner world is operating.</p>

<p>To be marked is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notice inner states instead of being ruled by them</li>
  <li>Release assumptions that produce unrest</li>
  <li>Begin living deliberately from peace</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the law of assumption in action.</p>

<p>The mind is brought into order, Jerusalem becomes peaceful again, and the teaching changes — not because the world is fixed, but because <strong>the assumption has</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“I AM” remains — only the state changes.</strong></p>
