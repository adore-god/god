<h1>Seven: The Completion of Creation</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Neville Goddard teaches that <strong>assumption</strong> — the act of <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">believing something is already true</a> — is the key to creating our reality. The power of assumption is central to both the <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">completion of creation</a> and the fulfillment of Christ's work. This process is inherently tied to <strong>imagination</strong> as the creative force through which we manifest our desires. Let’s explore how the number seven and the act of <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">assuming completion</a> play a significant role in manifesting spiritual perfection.</p><h2>The Seventh Day: Assuming Completion</h2><p>In the <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">creation story</a>, <a href="genesis-126-man.html">God (<i>your awareness of being</i>)</a> declares creation to be “good” on the seventh day. This is more than just satisfaction; it is an <strong>assumption</strong> that the work is complete. In Neville’s framework, this means God uses <strong>imagination</strong> to assume the <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">perfection of creation</a>, and that assumption brings it into existence. The seventh day of rest symbolizes a peaceful assurance — a deep, inner knowing that everything is already as it should be. When we rest in the assumption of fulfillment, we align with the creative power of imagination, allowing our desires to manifest effortlessly.</p><h2>Jesus’ Words: "It Is Finished"</h2><p>When <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> declares “It is finished” on the <a href="the-mark-of-beast-cains-mark-and-jesus.html">cross</a>, He embodies the principle of assumption. He assumes the fulfillment of His mission before any physical evidence confirms it. Just like God in the creation story, Jesus uses the power of <strong>imagination</strong> to affirm that His work is already complete. In Neville’s framework, this statement is a direct use of assumption — by declaring the end result, Jesus aligns His inner world with His external reality. In this way, He makes His assumption manifest.</p><h2>Resting in the Assumption</h2><p>In Neville’s teachings, <strong>rest</strong> is the natural result of assuming your desires are already fulfilled. Jesus invites us to this state of rest, where we cease striving and trust that what we have imagined will manifest. Just as God rested after assuming creation was complete, we too must rest in the certainty that our desires have already been fulfilled. The act of resting is a conscious acknowledgment that the <strong>imagination</strong> has done its work, and now it is time for the external world to align with our assumption.</p><h2>Creation and Redemption: A Unified Assumption</h2><p>Both the creation story and the redemption through Christ illustrate the power of <strong>assumption</strong>. In both cases, the act of assuming completion — whether it’s the creation of the world or the work of salvation — brings the internal world into alignment with the external. Neville’s framework of assumption shows that by imagining the fulfillment of our desires, we bring that imagined reality into being. Jesus’ declaration, “It is finished,” reflects the idea that through the assumption of fulfillment, we shape the physical world.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>By embodying the assumption that our desires are already fulfilled, we engage in the creative process, much like God did in the beginning and Jesus did on the cross. <strong>Imagination</strong>, when used in the form of assumption, is the key to manifesting reality. Through assumption, we create peace and fulfillment in our lives. Just as God and Jesus rested in the certainty of completion, we too can rest in the assurance that our imaginal acts will bring about the reality we desire.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
