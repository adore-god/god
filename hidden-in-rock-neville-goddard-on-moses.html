<h1>Moses: Hidden in the Rock</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Exodus 33:18&ndash;23, there&rsquo;s a mysterious and beautiful moment where Moses asks to see <a href="elohim-god.html">God's</a> glory. The <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a> responds by placing him in a cleft of the rock, covering him with His hand, and passing by:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And the Lord said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shalyt stand upon a rock:<br/>
And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a clift of the rock,<br/>
and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:<br/>
And I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; <strong>Exodus 33:21&ndash;23 (KJV)</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville Goddard, known for his deeply symbolic and psychological readings of Scripture, unpacked this scene in a way that reveals a profound truth: this is not a historical episode, but a <strong>symbolic map of spiritual awakening</strong>&mdash;the inward journey to discovering that <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> is God</strong>.</p><hr/><h2>Moses: The Desire to Know the Divine</h2><p>To Neville, <strong>Moses</strong> symbolises the <em>individual&rsquo;s awakened desire</em> to know God directly. He interprets the name &ldquo;Moses&rdquo; as coming from an Egyptian root meaning &ldquo;to be born,&rdquo; pointing to the <strong>birth of a deeper awareness</strong> within.</p><p>Moses isn&rsquo;t simply a man; he is a <strong>state of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a></strong>&mdash;a stirring within us to know our own divine nature.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Moses represents the power in man to draw out of the deep the one who will lead you into the promised land of fulfilment.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This desire to <em>see God's glory</em> is not a request to behold a being &ldquo;out there,&rdquo; but the soul&rsquo;s longing to <em>experience the truth</em> that <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> is the only reality.</strong></p><hr/><h2>The Rock: Your Unshakeable Foundation</h2><p>The <strong>rock</strong> is not geological&mdash;it is <strong>spiritual</strong>. It represents the <strong>foundation of Being</strong>, the awareness of &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;. Neville writes that <em>&ldquo;the rock is your own skull&rdquo;</em>&mdash;not a literal place, but the seat of consciousness itself. Being placed in the <em>cleft of the rock</em> means you are being hidden <strong>within your own awareness</strong>, beyond the reach of the senses.</p><p>To stand upon the rock is to be established in the truth:</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Be still, and know that <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> God.&rdquo; (Psalm 46:10)</p>
</blockquote><hr/><h2>The Hand of God: The Veil of Perception</h2><p>God covering Moses with His hand represents <strong>the limitation of human perception</strong>. Neville taught that you cannot perceive God directly while clothed in flesh and sense-consciousness. The <strong>hand</strong> is symbolic of the <strong>veil</strong>&mdash;the boundary that protects you from premature exposure to a truth you&rsquo;re not yet ready to absorb.</p><p>Only when one is "born from above," as Neville often put it, can the fullness of God&rsquo;s face (pure awareness) be unveiled.</p><hr/><h2>The Back Parts: Manifestation Reveals the Source</h2><p>God allows Moses to see only His <strong>back parts</strong>. This, Neville says, refers to how we know the Divine <strong>not by direct sight</strong>, but by the <strong>effects</strong>&mdash;by what follows our inner assumptions.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You do not see God&rsquo;s face&mdash;you see His &lsquo;back&rsquo;; that is, you see the outer world as evidence of what you have accepted inwardly as true.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>You don't often realise that <em>I AM</em> is creating reality in the moment&mdash;it&rsquo;s only later, in retrospect, that you notice the path, the pattern, the fulfilment. You see the Divine in action, <em>after</em> He has passed by.</p><hr/><h2>Moses and Joshua: From Desire to Fulfilment</h2><p>Neville also pointed out that <strong>Moses never enters the Promised Land</strong>. That task falls to <strong>Joshua</strong>, whose name is the Hebrew form of <em>Jesus</em>&mdash;symbolising the <strong>manifestation of salvation</strong>.</p><p>Moses represents the <strong>desire</strong> to see truth. Joshua represents its <strong>embodiment</strong>.</p><p>Desire initiates the journey, but <strong>fulfilment comes only through assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>, which is Neville&rsquo;s core message. The Promised Land isn&rsquo;t geography&mdash;it&rsquo;s a state of consciousness.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion: I AM Revealed in You</h2><p>This passage in Exodus is a map of your own transformation. It describes the process of becoming <em>aware</em> of your divine nature.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Moses</strong> is your desire to know truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The rock</strong> is your own consciousness&mdash;your &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The hand</strong> is the veil of limited perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The back parts</strong> are the outer manifestations that follow inner assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The face of God</strong> is your own true identity, which is unveiled only through rebirth into spiritual consciousness.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville&rsquo;s mystical reading of this story leads us back, not to the desert of Sinai, but <strong>into ourselves</strong>&mdash;where all true revelation takes place.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The day you dare to claim that you are God, you will find people calling you mad, and they will be quite right&mdash;until that day when you actually discover that you are God.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard</em></p></blockquote><div class="share-dropdown">
