<h1>Moses: Hidden in the Rock</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In Exodus 33:18–23, there’s a mysterious and beautiful moment where Moses asks to see <a href="elohim-god.html">God's</a> glory. The <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a> responds by placing him in a cleft of the rock, covering him with His hand, and passing by:</p><blockquote>
<em>“And the Lord said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shalyt stand upon a rock:<br><br> 
And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a clift of the rock,<br><br> 
and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:<br><br> 
And I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.”</em><br>
— <strong>Exodus 33:21–23 (KJV)</strong>
</blockquote><p>Neville Goddard, known for his symbolic and psychological readings of Scripture, unpacked this scene in a way that reveals a profound premise: this is not a historical episode, but a <strong>symbolic map of spiritual awakening</strong>—the inward journey to discovering that <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> is the one true God</strong>.</p><h2>Moses: The Desire to Know the Divine</h2><p>To Neville, <strong>Moses</strong> symbolises the <em>individual’s desire</em> to know God directly. He interprets the name “Moses” as coming from an Egyptian root meaning “to be born,” pointing to the <strong>birth of a deeper awareness</strong>.</p><p>Moses isn’t simply a man; he is a <strong>state of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">consciousness</a></strong>—a stirring within us to know our own nature.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Moses represents the power in man to draw out of the deep the one who will lead you into the promised land of fulfilment.”<br>
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This desire to <em>see God's glory</em> is not a request to behold a being “out there,” but the soul’s longing to <em>experience the truth</em> that <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> is the only reality.</strong></p><h2>The Rock: Your Unshakeable Foundation</h2><p>The <strong>rock</strong> is not geological—it is <strong>spiritual</strong>. It represents the <strong>foundation of Being</strong>, the awareness of “I AM”. Neville writes that <em>“the rock is your own skull”</em>—not a literal place, but the seat of consciousness itself. Being placed in the <em>cleft of the rock</em> means you are being hidden <strong>within your own awareness</strong>, beyond the reach of the senses.</p><p>To stand upon the rock is to be established in the truth:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Be still, and know that <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> God.” (Psalm 46:10)</p>
</blockquote><h2>The Hand of God: The Veil of Perception</h2><p>God covering Moses with His hand represents <strong>the limitation of human perception</strong>. Neville taught that you cannot perceive God directly while clothed in flesh and sense-consciousness. The <strong>hand</strong> is symbolic of the <strong>veil</strong>—the boundary that protects you from premature exposure to a truth you’re not yet ready to absorb.</p><p>Only when one is "born from above," as Neville often put it, can the fullness of God’s face (pure awareness) be unveiled.</p><h2>The Back Parts: Manifestation Reveals the Source</h2><p>God allows Moses to see only His <strong>back parts</strong>. This, Neville says, refers to how we know the Divine <strong>not by direct sight</strong>, but by the <strong>effects</strong>—by what follows our inner assumptions.</p><blockquote>
<p>“You do not see God’s face—you see His ‘back’; that is, you see the outer world as evidence of what you have accepted inwardly as true.”<br>
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>You don't often realise that <em>I AM</em> is creating reality in the moment—it’s only later, in retrospect, that you notice the path, the pattern, the fulfilment. You see the Divine in action, <em>after</em> He has passed by.</p><h2>Moses and Joshua: From Desire to Fulfilment</h2><p>Neville also pointed out that <strong>Moses never enters the Promised Land</strong>. That task falls to <strong>Joshua</strong>, whose name is the Hebrew form of <em>Jesus</em>—symbolising the <strong>manifestation of salvation</strong>.</p><p>Moses represents the <strong>desire</strong> to see truth. Joshua represents its <strong>embodiment</strong>.</p><p>Desire initiates the journey, but <strong>fulfilment comes only through assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>, which is Neville’s core message. The Promised Land isn’t geography—it’s a state of consciousness.</p><h2>Conclusion: I AM Revealed in You</h2><p>This passage in Exodus is a map of your own transformation. It describes the process of becoming <em>aware</em> of your divine nature.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Moses</strong> is your desire to know truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The rock</strong> is your own consciousness—your “I AM.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The hand</strong> is the veil of limited perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The back parts</strong> are the outer manifestations that follow inner assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The face of God</strong> is your own true identity, which is unveiled only through rebirth into spiritual consciousness.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville’s mystical reading of this story leads us back, not to the desert of Sinai, but <strong>into ourselves</strong>—where all true revelation takes place.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The day you dare to claim that you are God, you will find people calling you mad, and they will be quite right—until that day when you actually discover that you are God.”<br>
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p></blockquote><div class="share-dropdown">
