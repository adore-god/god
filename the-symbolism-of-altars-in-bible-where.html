<h1>The Symbolism of Altars</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Altars appear frequently throughout the Bible—physical structures where sacrifices were offered, prayers were spoken, and covenants were marked. But through the spiritual interpretation of scripture, particularly through the teachings of Neville Goddard, altars transcend their historical or ritualistic form. They become rich symbols of inward transformation, creative focus and rebirth.</p>
<p>An altar, at its core, is not a platform for external ritual, but a point of inward decision. It is the place in consciousness where one chooses to sacrifice an old state, an old belief, or a limitation, and lay it down before God—before one’s own <a href="elohim-god.html">imagination, which Neville declares <em>is</em> God.</a></p>
<hr>
<h3>Altars as Inner Turning‑Points</h3>
<p>In <em>Genesis</em>, we read that Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and others built altars after momentous inner events: visions, promises or encounters with <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, ‘To your offspring I will give this land.’ So he built an altar there to the Lord, who had appeared to him.”<br>
— <strong>Genesis 12:7</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the altar marks a shift into faith.  Building it is a consecration of a new state of consciousness: “I believe this now. I accept this truth within myself.”</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Two Altars of the Tabernacle: Flesh and Spirit</h3>
<p>When Moses erects the Tabernacle, God prescribes two altars—each pointing to distinct facets of inner work:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Brazen Altar (Exodus 27:1–8)</strong><br>
At the court’s entrance, this copper‑covered altar symbolises the <em>initial sacrifice</em>—the surrender of external, carnal attachments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You shall make the altar of acacia wood... and its height shall be three cubits.”<br>
— <strong>Exodus 27:1</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Golden Altar of Incense (Exodus 30:1–10)</strong><br>
Inside the Holy Place, this altar of pure frankincense represents <em>ongoing communion</em>—the sweet fragrance of sustained prayer, praise and assumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Aaron shall burn fragrant incense on it. Every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall burn it.”<br>
— <strong>Exodus 30:7</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Together they map the two‑step journey of manifestation: first, <em>sacrifice</em> (letting go of the old), then <em>incense</em> (steadfast inner conversation with the new).</p>
<hr>
<h3>Neville Goddard on the Altar: Six Dimensions of Inner Sacrifice</h3>
<h4>1. Imagination as the Altering Power</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“Imagination is not a figment of the mind; it is the only power there is. It is God in action. It creates reality.”<br>
— <em>The Power of Awareness</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the altar is the place where you offer up present reality—your doubts, your limitations—to the transforming fire of imagination itself. This sacrifice is not loss, but the alchemical process by which the old self is dissolved.</p>
<h4>2. Alignment with God’s Will</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“Prayer is the key to the kingdom, but the kingdom is within you. You are the altar, and the power is in your imagination.”<br>
— <em>The Power of Awareness</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>True prayer, Neville teaches, is assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled. On your inner altar you align every thought and desire with the deeper current of divine truth, saying “Thy will” even as you hold your vision.</p>
<h4>3. Complete Commitment</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“You must be willing to surrender completely to the belief in your desire. There is no halfway in this. You must be prepared to make the sacrifice of your former self and fully embody the new state.”<br>
— <em>The Law and the Promise</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This matches Abraham’s willingness on Mount Moriah: to offer Isaac meant to relinquish attachment to the promise itself—and thereby demonstrate unwavering faith. The altar becomes the site of total commitment.</p>
<h4>4. Decision as Ignition</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“The decision is the ignition. You make a decision, and from that moment on, you start the process of spiritual rebirth.”<br>
— <em>The Power of Imagination</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building an altar is a decisive act. The moment you resolve within—“This is who I now choose to be”—you spark the process of transformation that carries through to physical manifestation.</p>
<h4>5. The Cross of Transformation</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“The crucifixion of Jesus is the ultimate transformation that each must experience. The ‘cross’ represents the mental sacrifice of one identity for another.”<br>
— <em>The Power of Awareness</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as burnt offerings consume the old on the brazen altar, the cross—and by extension the altar—symbolises death to the former self and resurrection into the new. It is an ongoing, sacred process of dying and rising.</p>
<h4>6. Altar as Creation in Action</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are the creator of your world, and the altar is where you place the gift of your imagination.”<br>
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every offering you lay on the altar of your mind—every sustained assumption—is an act of creation. The brazen altar yields the old; the golden altar keeps the new vision burning until it becomes substance.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Altar and the Burnt Offering</h3>
<p>Fire in Scripture symbolises transformation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our God is a consuming fire.”<br>
— <strong>Hebrews 12:29</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Put off your old self... to be made new in the attitude of your minds.”<br>
— <strong>Ephesians 4:22–23</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you bring the old self to the altar and allow it to be consumed by the power of imagination, what remains is the purified new creation.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Jacob’s Pillow Becomes an Altar</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“How awesome is this place!... So early in the morning Jacob took the stone... and set it up as a pillar.”<br>
— <strong>Genesis 28:17–18</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacob’s pillow‑stone transforms into a pillar, marking the moment he realises the link between earth and heaven is within himself. Every new insight you consecrate becomes your Bethel.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Inner Altar and the Prerequisite of Harmony</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you… first go and be reconciled…”<br>
— <strong>Matthew 5:23–24</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”<br>
— <strong>James 1:8</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the altar can receive your vision, every inner contradiction—guilt, doubt, shame—must be reconciled. Only a unified self can offer a whole gift.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Abraham and the Offering of Isaac: Surrender of the Dearest State</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Take your son... whom you love—Isaac—and sacrifice him... as a burnt offering.”<br>
— <strong>Genesis 22:2</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead.”<br>
— <strong>Hebrews 11:19</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isaac embodies Abraham’s deepest desire. To place him on the altar symbolises letting go of even the promise itself—trusting that the divine will provide. This is faith’s ultimate demonstration.</p>
<hr>
<h3>A Call to Build Within</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“You yourselves, like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house... to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God.”<br>
— <strong>1 Peter 2:5</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every sustained act of imagination, every decisive surrender of old beliefs, builds your inner altar. Altars are sacred not because of their materials, but because of <em>what is offered</em>—the gift of your fully embodied vision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Present your bodies as a living sacrifice... which is your spiritual worship.”<br>
— <strong>Romans 12:1</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is your holy place.<br>
This is your altar.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-architecture-series.html" class="noTag">Architecture Series</a> | <a href="label-object-symbolism.html" class="noTag">Object Symbolism</a></p>
