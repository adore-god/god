<h1>Woman Clothed With The Sun</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><strong>With a Comparison to Song of Solomon 6:10&ndash;12</strong></p><p>The Bible is not a historical or religious text&mdash;it is the epic drama of human <a href='."elohim-god.html"'> consciousness</a> unfolding. According to Neville Goddard, its stories are metaphors and symbols revealing the workings of your own imagination. Each character, place, and event is a state of being or a movement within your psyche.</p><p>When seen this way, the Bible becomes a living guide for self-transformation. It maps the journey from outer limitation to inner distinct awareness&mdash;from the bondage of old beliefs to the freedom of new assumptions.</p><hr/><h4>Revelation 12:1&ndash;6 &mdash; The Inner Birth of a New Self</h4><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:<br/>
And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.<br/>
And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.<br/>
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.<br/>
And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.<br/>
And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.&rdquo; &mdash; Revelation 12:1-6(KJV)</p>
</blockquote><p>This <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a> is the awakened subconscious imagination, the divine feminine within you&mdash;the fertile womb where new states of consciousness are formed.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clothed with the sun</strong>: Wrapped in spiritual illumination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moon under her feet</strong>: She stands above fluctuating emotion and reflected reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crown of twelve stars</strong>: Complete spiritual authority, possibly the twelve faculties of man aligned with higher awareness.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Her <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">travail in giving birth</a> is the inner struggle of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">shifting identity</a>&mdash;the discomfort and tension experienced when you move from the known to the newly assumed &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo; The great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, is symbolic of <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">doubt, habitual logic, and the dominance of the five senses</a>&mdash;the <a href="shimei-self-deprecating-voice-that.html">voice of disbelief that threatens your new creation</a>.</p><p>The <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man child</a> she births is the firm assumption of your divine nature, fixed in your consciousness (&ldquo;caught up unto God and His throne&rdquo;). The woman&rsquo;s flight into the wilderness signifies the waiting period of manifestation&mdash;a time of faith, persistence, and unseen nurturing.</p><hr/><h4>Song of Solomon 6:10&ndash;12 &mdash; The Radiant Beloved</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?</strong><br/>
<strong>I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.</strong><br/>
<strong>Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.&rdquo;</strong> <em>(KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the woman is the imaginative response to the birth of new consciousness&mdash;radiant, beautiful, and powerful.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Fair as the moon, clear as the sun&rdquo;</strong> echoes Revelation&rsquo;s symbolism of the woman clothed with the sun and standing on the moon, expressing spiritual illumination and mastery over emotional fluctuation and reflective reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Terrible as an army with banners&rdquo;</strong> (also translated as &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; or &ldquo;majestic&rdquo;) expresses the awe-inspiring power and commanding presence of the awakened imagination&mdash;like a mighty army with banners advancing decisively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The swift, powerful movement expressed in &ldquo;my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib&rdquo; resonates with the woman fleeing into the wilderness in Revelation, moving through the unseen spaces with faith and strength toward manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr/><h4>One Woman &mdash; Two Expressions of the Imaginative &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;</h4><p>Both passages reveal <strong>the same inner woman</strong>&mdash;the awakened imaginative self, your inner &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;&mdash;presented in complementary ways:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Revelation 12</strong>, she is the active, creative force in labour, birthing new identity, crowned with divine authority, and standing victorious over doubt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Song of Solomon 6</strong>, she is the radiant beloved, the beautiful and powerful imaginative response that rises in joy and majesty as new states of being become assured and take hold.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Together, they portray a complete picture of spiritual transformation: the creative birthing act and the victorious emergence of your imaginative self, radiating strength and majesty.</p><hr/><h4>Conclusion: The Divine Drama Within</h4><p>Revelation 12 and Song of Solomon 6 invite you to recognise the woman within&mdash;the creative imaginative power that births your new reality and rejoices in her strength. Doubt and resistance may roar like the red dragon, but persistence in your assumption of &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; will see your new self rise and rule.</p><p>As Neville Goddard said:<br/>
<strong>&ldquo;You give birth to that which you are conscious of being.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Hold fast to the radiant woman within, your creative &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo; Let the child be born. Let the imagination move swiftly and powerfully like an army with banners. Your world will reshape itself in the image of your inner conviction.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
