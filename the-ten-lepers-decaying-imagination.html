<h1>Ten Lepers: Decaying Imagination </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The story of the ten lepers in Luke 17:11–19 is often interpreted as a lesson in gratitude and healing. However, through Neville Goddard’s teachings, it reveals deeper insights into the inner workings and the decay of imagination, and the transformative power of praise and gratitude.</p><hr/><h2>The Symbolism of the Number Ten</h2><p>In biblical symbolism, the number <strong>10</strong> represents completion—a full cycle. The ten lepers embody a <a href="elohim-god.html">fragmented state of consciousness</a>, symbolising the scattered, disconnected aspects of the mind. Each leper reflects a different <a href="genesis-126-man.html">facet of the psyche</a>, separate from its true, whole self—mirroring the fragmentation of thought and identity that arises when we are disconnected from our creative power.</p><p>Goddard’s teachings suggest that true healing begins from within. The number 10 reflects the totality of these fragmented states of mind, and the healing process involves returning to wholeness. Just as the <strong>tithe</strong> symbolises returning a portion of wealth to its source, the one leper who returns to give thanks represents the conscious act of returning awareness to the <strong>“<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>”</strong>—the source of all creation.</p><hr/><h2>Leprosy: The Decay of Imagination</h2><p>Leprosy, in the Bible, is more than a physical ailment; it symbolises the decay or corruption of the <a href="elohim-god.html">imagination</a>. In Neville’s framework, leprosy represents a state where imagination—the divine creative force—becomes disconnected from its source. When imagination is fragmented and not used consciously, it decays, and the person experiences a form of spiritual isolation or "leprosy."</p><p>The ten lepers are not just suffering from physical illness but embody different aspects of fragmented imagination. Their healing reflects the restoration of imagination to its rightful place as the divine creative power. Leprosy is thus a metaphor for the neglect of this power—when we forget our ability to shape reality and instead become bogged down by external circumstances.</p><hr/><h2>The Tithe: Returning to the Source</h2><p>In this story, the act of returning to give thanks symbolises the spiritual principle of tithing—not as money, but as the conscious return of awareness to its source. Just as a tithe in ancient times was a portion of wealth given back to God, the returning leper represents the return of awareness to the <strong>“I AM,”</strong> the inner power that governs all creation.</p><p>While the other nine lepers continue on their journey seeking external validation through rituals, the one who returns transcends these external forms of healing. This act of gratitude signals an inward shift—aligning with the inner source of healing rather than seeking validation from the outside world. In Goddard’s interpretation, this is a profound lesson in the power of self-awareness and conscious assumption.</p><hr/><h2>Gratitude: The Mark of True Change</h2><p>The moment of true healing occurs when the one leper expresses gratitude. Jesus, recognising the faith of this man, declares that he is not just healed but made whole. This is the crucial point—while all ten lepers were physically cleansed, only the returning leper experienced the <strong>inner shift</strong> that brought about true transformation.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, gratitude is more than mere appreciation. It is an <strong>active acknowledgment</strong> of the assumption that the desired state has already been realised. When we persist in a new assumption and express gratitude for it, we align ourselves with the state we wish to embody. Gratitude, therefore, is the confirmation that we are now one with the state we once sought. It marks the shift from fragmented consciousness to a whole, unified awareness.</p><hr/><h2>Praise: The Expression of Wholeness</h2><p>The returning leper does more than give thanks—he also <a href="the-lion-rules-domination-and-dominion.html">praises</a>. Praise is not just an external expression, but a spiritual recognition of the alignment between the individual and their divine source. In Neville’s interpretation, praise is an acknowledgment that the individual has stepped into the state of wholeness and divine power. It is an outward declaration of the inward realisation that the desired change has already occurred.</p><p>Praise, then, is the final step in the return to wholeness. It is the recognition that the fragmented self has become integrated into a complete, unified consciousness. The returning leper’s praise symbolises the spiritual state of <strong>“I AM”</strong>—the recognition that one is whole, that the divine power resides within, and that all external seeking is unnecessary.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion: From Fragmentation to Wholeness</h2><p>The story of the ten lepers is a powerful metaphor for the journey of the mind from fragmentation to wholeness. The ten lepers symbolise the fragmented states of consciousness that feel disconnected from their true creative power. The number 10 represents the totality of these disconnected states, and the return of the one leper reflects the conscious act of returning to the source of creation - the <strong>“I AM.”</strong></p><p>Leprosy represents the decay of imagination and the consequences of living in a fragmented, disconnected state. True healing comes when we return to our inner power, assume the state of wholeness, and express gratitude for it. Through the act of tithing—returning our awareness to the divine source, and the expression of praise, we align with the divine and step into our true, whole selves.</p><p>Gratitude and praise are not just expressions of appreciation but are active markers of a profound inner shift. They signify that we have moved from external seeking to internal realisation, from fragmented consciousness to the full, unified awareness of who we are</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-healing-series.html">Healing Series</a> | <a href="label-numbers--ten.html">Numbers: Ten</a> | <a href="label-parable-series.html">Parable Series</a> | <a href="label-praise-series.html">Praise Series</a></p>
