<h1>The Title “Lord God” and YHVH: The Meaning</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>
<strong>Lord (YHVH)</strong> — the active rulership of imagination. In Scripture, “Lord” is not a distant deity but a title derived from God being called <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">'Judges' and 'Rulers' of 'I AM THAT I AM'</a>. Psychologically, it signifies the ruling assumption — the state of consciousness currently enthroned and exercising authority in the mind. The “Lord” is whatever conception of <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> is judging, 'Lording over' directing, and governing perception and experience.
</p>

<p>The name <strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a></strong> is one of the most recognised and revered names in the world. Yet behind the simplicity of these five letters lies a profound spiritual mystery — a message of salvation, creation, and the inner process at work within each of us. When we explore its original <a href="the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew form</a> and examine it through Neville Goddard’s teachings on the Law of Assumption, we discover not a distant saviour but the living pattern of our own creative consciousness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Jesus: The Hebrew Origin and Hidden Meaning</strong></h2>

<p>In Hebrew, Jesus is:</p>

<p>יְהוֹשׁוּעַ (<em>Yehoshua</em>) or its shortened form יֵשׁוּעַ (<em>Yeshua</em>)</p>

<p>Both forms mean:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Yahweh is salvation”<br>
or more intimately: “The LORD saves” / “God saves”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The name is composed of:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Yah" (יָה)</strong> — a shortened form of YHVH, the divine name associated with rulership, judgment, and authority</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"yasha" (יָשַׁע)</strong> — to save, deliver, or rescue</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Neville taught that <strong>“<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>”</strong> (from Exodus 3:14) is the true name of God. Thus, in psychological terms, the name Jesus implies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jesus = “I AM” saves</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, whatever you are consciously ruling yourself to be — whatever state sits as “Lord” in your mind — determines your salvation or bondage.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>From Yeshua to Jesus: The Linguistic Journey</strong></h2>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hebrew</td>

<tr>
<td>Greek</td>
<td>Iēsous (Ἰησοῦς)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Latin</td>
<td>Iesus</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>English</td>
<td>Jesus</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Though the letters transformed, the essential meaning remained unchanged: salvation comes through the ruling identity of “I AM.”</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>YHVH: The Divine Pattern of Manifestation</strong></h2>

<p>The sacred name YHVH (יהוה) is not merely a label for God but a structural name — a name of rulership. In Hebrew thought, names describe function. YHVH describes how consciousness judges, orders, and brings states into form.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Mather’s Table</a> and Neville’s interpretation, each letter represents a stage in the creative act:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Yod (י)</strong> — the seed; a judgment or decision of “I AM” to be something</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He (ה)</strong> — the opening or window; inner perception shaping the assumed state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vav (ו)</strong> — the nail or peg; the fixing of the judgment through feeling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He (ה)</strong> — the visible result; the ruled world reflecting the inner decree</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yod → He → Vav → He</strong><br>
<strong>Decision → Perception → Fixation → Expression</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why YHVH is repeatedly associated with <a href="el/bible-kingdom-structure.html">judges, kings, and rulers in Scripture: it is the name of governing consciousness</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>The “Lord” as Ruler of the Mind</strong></h2>

<p>In biblical language, “Lord” (YHVH) refers to the ruling power — the authority presently seated over the <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">inner world</a>. A “lord” is a judge, and a judge decides what is true, possible, and real.</p>

<p>Psychologically, the Lord is the dominant assumption occupying the forefront in the <a href="el/bible-kingdom-structure.html">kingdom of the mind</a>. Whatever state you identify with as “I AM” becomes your lord and rules your outcomes.</p>

<p>“God” refers to pure awareness — <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> itself. When Scripture says <strong>“Lord God”</strong>, it describes awareness actively ruling through a defined assumption.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>The Double “I AM” and Inner Authority</strong></h2>

<p>Exodus 3:14 states: <strong>“I AM that I AM.”</strong></p>

<p>Neville revealed that this doubling points to two functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The first <strong>I AM</strong> — awareness as source</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second <strong>I AM</strong> — awareness as ruler, judging itself to be something</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the Father–Son relationship within consciousness. The Father is awareness itself; the Son is the ruled identity — the state enthroned as Lord.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Jesus as the Ruling Identity</strong></h2>

<p>Jesus symbolises the awakened imagination ruling rightly. To “believe in the name” is not to worship a figure but to consciously enthrone a new identity as Lord within.</p>

<p>Salvation occurs the moment a new state is accepted as ruler — when “I AM” judges itself to be free, whole, fulfilled, or loved.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Genesis and the Shift from Lord God to Lord</strong></h2>

<p>In early Genesis, the title <strong>“Lord God” (YHVH Elohim)</strong> is used, indicating awareness consciously ruling through alignment.</p>

<p>After the fall — the identification with appearances — Scripture often uses <strong>“Lord”</strong> alone. This reflects consciousness still ruling, but now through fragmented, unconscious judgments rather than deliberate assumption.</p>

<p>The Lord never disappears; only the quality of rulership changes.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion: Who Is Your Lord?</strong></h2>

<p>The Bible’s question is never whether you have a Lord — but which one. Every moment, a state rules. The name Jesus reveals that salvation is not external rescue but inner rulership. When “I AM” consciously judges itself to be what it desires, the right Lord is enthroned, and the world must follow.</p>
