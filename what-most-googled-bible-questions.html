<h1>What the Most Googled Bible Questions Reveal&mdash;and What Neville Goddard Would Say</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>It&rsquo;s telling that some of the most commonly Googled Bible questions aren&rsquo;t about historical accuracy or doctrine, but about deeply personal and emotional issues. People want to know what the Bible says about sexuality, tattoos, the afterlife, and more&mdash;not just to understand Scripture, but to find clarity about themselves.</p>
<p>Through Neville Goddard&rsquo;s teachings, we discover that these are not external rules, but symbolic stories showing the workings of human consciousness and imagination.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;What does the Bible say about homosexuality?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>In Neville's framework, the Bible is not a rulebook but a revelation of spiritual truth encoded in symbol and parable. It does not judge literal behaviour but illustrates inner dynamics.</p>
<p>The term <em>man</em> often symbolises consciousness, and <em>union</em> or <em>relations</em> symbolise states joining or merging. Seen symbolically, discussions around sexuality point to how different aspects of self (masculine/feminine = conscious/subconscious) are aligned or misaligned.</p>
<p>True &ldquo;sin&rdquo; for Neville is not moral violation, but <strong>missing the mark</strong>&mdash;failing to imagine lovingly, not conforming to societal expectations.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;What does the Bible say about tattoos?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Tattoos in biblical texts often represent identity or allegiance. Neville would interpret this spiritually: what markings&mdash;what assumptions&mdash;have you allowed onto your consciousness?</p>
<p>What beliefs have been etched into your mind, and therefore into your world?</p>
<p>The real &ldquo;tattoos&rdquo; are the inner convictions you wear invisibly&mdash;your repeated assumptions, which become your fate.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;Can a Christian lose salvation?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Salvation, for Neville, is the awakening to your creative power&mdash;the realisation that <em>I AM</em> is God. You can forget this truth (descend into a lower state), but you cannot lose what is eternally within you.</p>
<p>Salvation is not a contract; it is a <strong>state of remembrance</strong>. You may fall asleep to your power, but you can always reawaken.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;What does the Bible say about suicide?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Neville frames all Bible stories as psychological parables. Suicide, in its symbolic sense, is not just the end of physical life, but the <strong>collapse of self-awareness</strong>, the wounding of hope, the silence of imagination.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;kill&rdquo; yourself can represent surrendering to despair. Yet Scripture also shows that resurrection is always offered. Lazarus, who dies, is called forth: <em>&ldquo;Come out!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>That voice is imagination&mdash;rising again from the tomb of limitation.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;Do pets go to heaven?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Heaven, in Neville&rsquo;s teaching, is not a place but a <strong>state of consciousness</strong>. All things exist in imagination.</p>
<p>The love we share with animals is a part of us&mdash;eternally held in the imagination of God, which is our imagination. In that sense, nothing is lost.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;What happens after death?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Death is a transition&mdash;a shift in awareness. Just as we move from dream to waking, we move from one state to another. The <em>I AM</em> never dies; it changes form, context, and experience.</p>
<p>Consciousness continues, clothed in the beliefs it held at the time of transition.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;What does the Bible say about drinking alcohol?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Alcohol in Scripture symbolises <strong>influence</strong> or <strong>spiritual saturation</strong>. To be drunk may mean to be overtaken&mdash;either by divine fervour or destructive suggestion.</p>
<p>Neville would urge: watch what thoughts you imbibe. The only intoxication worth pursuing is one of divine imagination and loving conviction.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;What does the Bible say about divorce and remarriage?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>In symbolic terms, &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; means <strong>the union of states</strong>. To divorce is to detach from a former identity; to remarry is to assume a new one.</p>
<p>Neville encourages us to &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; from states of fear, limitation, and doubt, and marry the feeling of the wish fulfilled. The Bible is a chronicle of inner transition&mdash;from bondage to freedom, from shadow to selfhood.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;What does the Bible say about sex before marriage?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Sex is symbolic of <strong>creative union</strong> in Neville&rsquo;s teaching&mdash;where the conscious (masculine) and subconscious (feminine) come together to conceive reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage&rdquo; is not legality but the full assumption of a state. The real question is: are your desires aligned with your inner belief? True purity lies not in behaviour, but in intention.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;What does the Bible say about dinosaurs?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>This question belongs more to history than spiritual revelation. From Neville&rsquo;s view, the Bible is not concerned with literal history but with <strong>symbolic unfolding</strong>.</p>
<p>Whether dinosaurs existed (and evidence suggests they did) does not negate the inner truths of Scripture: that <em>man is imagination</em>, and the world is its projection.</p>
<hr/>
<h1><strong>The Bigger Questions</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;Is there a God?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Yes&mdash;and Neville says: <em>God is your own wonderful human imagination</em>. The creator is not separate from you. Every time you say &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; you are naming the creative power of the universe.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;Why does God allow pain and suffering?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Because God is not a puppeteer. God is you&mdash;asleep, unaware of your own creative capacity. Suffering arises from unconscious creation, from allowing fear, doubt, and old assumptions to rule.</p>
<p>But you can revise. You can imagine anew.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;Is the Bible reliable?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>The Bible is not historically accurate&mdash;it is <strong>spiritually exact</strong>. Every character and event mirrors a psychological journey.</p>
<p>It is a map of consciousness: a symbolic autobiography of the soul awakening to its own divinity.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;Is Jesus God?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Yes&mdash;and so are you, in potential. Jesus symbolises the <strong>awakened imagination</strong>&mdash;the realisation that &ldquo;I and my Father are one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To live as Jesus is to assume your ideal, forgive all, and trust in the unseen reality until it becomes flesh.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;Can I know God personally?&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>You already do. Every time you imagine, love, grieve, or hope, you engage with God.</p>
<p>God is not separate. God is <em>I AM</em>. And that is the name you whisper every moment of your life.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>In Closing</strong></h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever Googled one of these questions, perhaps what you&rsquo;re really looking for isn&rsquo;t just an answer&mdash;but <strong>yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>According to Neville Goddard, that&rsquo;s the true revelation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are the one you&rsquo;ve been searching for.</p></blockquote>
