<h1>Head as the House Allegory: Doors and Windows</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, <strong>symbols</strong> from the Bible are much more than mere allegories—they are profound expressions of the <strong>power of imagination</strong> and the <strong><a href="genesis-126-man.html">mind's ability to shape reality</a></strong>. Among these symbols, the <strong>door</strong> and <strong>window</strong> stand out as powerful metaphors, representing <strong>opportunities</strong> for change and <strong>mental gateways</strong> to new states of consciousness. Additionally, the concept of <strong>God as wind</strong> deepens our understanding of how the <strong>spirit of creation</strong> moves through us, guiding us into new realities.</p>

<p>The Bible often frames the <strong><a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">head as a house</a></strong>—a dwelling place of thought and imagination. Within this “house,” the <strong>window</strong> becomes the opening of the imagination, the way vision enters and light shines in. The <strong>door</strong>, meanwhile, represents the movement between states of awareness—whether you remain fixed on the outer senses or shift inward to imagination. In this way, the house, the door, and the window are not external buildings but the architecture of your own consciousness.</p>

<hr>
<h3><strong>The Door: A Gateway to New Consciousness</strong></h3>
<p>Neville Goddard interpreted the <strong>door</strong> as a <strong>gateway</strong> to a new state of consciousness. It represents a <strong>mental transition</strong>—the moment when you decide to move from one mental state to another, from <strong>limitation to freedom</strong>, from <strong>lack to abundance</strong>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="elohim-god.html">house of the mind</a>, the <strong>door</strong> is the threshold where choice occurs. To remain with the senses is to stay within one <a href="in-my-fathers-house-john-142-3.html">room of the house</a>; to shift inward, assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, is to walk through the door into another. As Neville said:<br>
<em>“Consciousness is the door to the world you experience.”</em></p>

<p>This <strong>door</strong> is an invitation and a decision. Each time you assume the end and live from it, you cross a <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">new threshold (portrayed by the beloved David) and enter a state where your desire is already real</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h3><strong>The Window: A Vision of Possibility</strong></h3>
<p>If the <strong>door</strong> is transition, the <strong>window</strong> is vision. The <strong>window</strong> symbolises the <strong>imagination itself</strong>—the opening in the house of the mind through which you see beyond the present state. Just as a window lets in light, imagination opens a clear sightline to a world that exists within you before it is seen without.</p>

<p>The <strong>window</strong> is where you <strong>visualise</strong>, where you catch the <strong>clear view</strong> of your desired reality. The more focused and vivid the vision, the stronger its power to shape your world. As Neville would affirm:<br>
<em>“If you can see it in your mind, you can hold it in your hand.”</em></p>

<p>Thus the window is not passive—it is the act of inner seeing. To look through the window of imagination is to glimpse the life that is about to be made visible.</p>

<hr>
<h3><strong>God as the Wind: The Spirit of Creation</strong></h3>
<p>In the Scriptures, God is often depicted as <strong>wind</strong> or <strong>breath</strong>, as in John 3:8:<br>
<em>“The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going.”</em></p>

<p>For Neville, this wind is the <strong>creative spirit</strong> that animates imagination. Just as air moves freely through a house, so does the <strong>spirit of creation</strong> move through your inner world. It cannot be seen, yet it fills, inspires, and directs—bringing vision to life. The wind flows through the <strong>door</strong> of decision and the <strong>window</strong> of imagination, breathing life into the new state you choose to inhabit.</p>

<hr>
<h3><strong>The Connection: The Head as House, with Door, Window, and Wind</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>head as house</strong> provides the framework: a dwelling where thoughts, beliefs, and visions live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>door</strong> is the <strong>movement between states of awareness</strong>—the conscious decision to step away from the senses and into imagination, or back again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>window</strong> is <strong>imagination itself</strong>—the opening through which you see the possibility of a new world before it is born.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>God as the wind</strong> is the <strong>creative force</strong> flowing freely, animating vision and carrying it into manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Architecture of Consciousness</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s philosophy, the imagery of <strong>house, door, and window</strong> becomes the architecture of consciousness. The head is the house, the door is the threshold of decision, the window is the vision of imagination, and the wind is the invisible breath of God moving through it all.</p>

<p>The power to manifest lies within this living structure. Step through the <strong>door</strong> of decision, look through the <strong>window</strong> of imagination, and let the <strong>wind</strong> of spirit animate your vision. In this way, the “house” of the mind becomes the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">temple of creation itself.</a></p>
