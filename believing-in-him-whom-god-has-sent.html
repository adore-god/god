<h1>John: Believing in Him Whom God Has Sent</h1>
<p>Throughout the Gospel of John, one phrase echoes with mysterious importance: <em>“believe in Him whom He has sent.”</em> At first glance, it sounds like a call to religious faith in a historical figure. But when we interpret this through the teachings of Neville Goddard — who saw the Bible as a psychological drama, not secular history — the meaning becomes deeply personal and practical.</p><p>Neville taught that <strong><a href="elohim-god.html">God is your imagination</a></strong>, and that the "Son" or "sent one" is the <strong>state of consciousness</strong> <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">you’re called to assume</a>. Believing in “Him whom He has sent” is not about worshipping an external figure — it is about <strong><a href="genesis-126-man.html">accepting and embodying the version of yourself your imagination has revealed</a></strong>. This is the true “work of God”: the inner act of faith, the decision to feel from the end, to live from your desired state.</p><p>This symbolic thread of “the Son” doesn’t begin with Jesus in the New Testament. In fact, one of the clearest portrayals of the Son in the Old Testament is <strong>David the Beloved</strong>. Neville Goddard taught that David personifies the <strong>manifested result of inner belief</strong> — the visible proof of your union with the “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>.” When you fully identify with your ideal and persist in that state, David is “born” as its expression. In Psalm 2:7, God declares, <em>“You are My Son, today I have begotten you,”</em> which Neville often quoted to illustrate the mystical moment when imagination (the Father) brings forth its fulfilled image (the Son). Just as David appears after Saul, the old state of being, the Son always emerges <strong>after the inner work of belief</strong>. Whether in the figure of David or Jesus, the Bible is inviting us to believe in the one sent by imagination — the ideal self — and let that belief transform us.</p><p>In this article, we’ll explore key verses where this phrase — and its surrounding theme — appears in the New Testament, uncovering their symbolic meaning and practical power using Neville Goddard’s spiritual framework.</p><hr/><h3><strong>John 6:29</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br/>
Your “work” is not action or effort in the outer world. It is the inner work of <strong>accepting as true the state your imagination (God) has presented to you</strong>. When you catch a vision of yourself as healed, successful, joyful — that version of you has been “sent” by your own divine I AM. Believing in it, living from it, is your true spiritual work.</p><hr/><h3><strong>John 3:16</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br/>
The “Son” is the expression of God — your <strong>conscious, imagined identity</strong>. To believe in the “Son” is to <strong>believe in the life you’ve imagined</strong>, your ideal fulfilled. “Perishing” means remaining in the old state of lack or fear. “Everlasting life” is the continual unfolding of your desire when you accept the new identity as already real.</p><hr/><h3><strong>John 5:38</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“But you do not have His word abiding in you, because whom He sent, Him you do not believe.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br/>
To have God’s “word” in you is to have <strong>awareness of your true I AM nature</strong>. If you reject the state your imagination offers — if you say “that could never be me” — then you are refusing the one whom God has sent. This verse shows that <strong>lack of belief in the ideal self</strong> is what prevents transformation.</p><hr/><h3><strong>John 3:36</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br/>
To believe in the Son — the imagined, felt state of being — is to enter into the flow of life itself. To reject it is to remain under the domination of the outer world (“wrath”) — where circumstances control you. This verse shows the inner consequences of accepting or denying your imaginative power.</p><hr/><h3><strong>John 20:31</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br/>
These verses are written not as history, but as a <strong>pattern of inner transformation</strong>. “Jesus is the Christ” means that your <strong>human imagination is the anointed (Christed) power</strong> of God. Believing in this truth brings life — the kind of creative power that lets you reshape your world from within.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Final Summary:</strong></h3><p>When the Bible says to <em>“believe in Him whom God has sent,”</em> Neville teaches that it’s a symbolic call to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Recognise <strong>your own desires</strong> as divine gifts sent from your imagination (God).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust the new state of consciousness, even if it feels foreign or too good to be true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persist in identifying with that ideal — thinking from it, not just of it.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>The “sent one” is not outside you.</strong> It is the version of you that your divine self (I AM) has imagined and offered.<br/>
<strong>To believe in Him is to awaken.</strong></p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-john-series.html">John Series</a></p>
