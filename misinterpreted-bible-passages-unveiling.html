<h1>Misinterpreted Bible Passages: Unveiling Their True Meaning Through Neville Goddard&rsquo;s Symbolic Framework</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Neville Goddard taught that every story, law and figure in Scripture is the symbolic language of consciousness.  In his view, the man-figures represent our conscious mind&mdash;the part that wills, decides and imagines&mdash;and the women-figures represent our subconscious&mdash;the part that faithfully brings to life whatever the conscious mind assumes.  When we apply the Law of Assumption to these passages, we see that what the Bible &ldquo;commands&rdquo; is not a set of external rules but a description of how thought becomes reality.</p>
<p>Below we re-read six frequently misused texts purely through this lens of conscious and subconscious interaction.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>1. Leviticus 18:22; 20:13 &ndash; &ldquo;You shall not lie with a male as with a woman&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Condemnation of same-sex love.<br/>
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> These verses describe the misuse of imagination when the conscious mind (man) wrongfully assumes it must limit the subconscious (woman).  The real command is: &ldquo;Do not impose restrictive beliefs on your subconscious.&rdquo;  Whenever the conscious self assumes that love and creativity can be restricted by outward forms, the subconscious obeys and brings limitation into experience.  Instead, assume that love is unlimited&mdash;and your subconscious will manifest freedom, acceptance and unity.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>2. 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 &ndash; &ldquo;Let your women keep silence in the churches&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Silencing of women&rsquo;s voices.<br/>
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> This admonition describes the moment when the conscious mind must pause its chattering and impress a clear assumption upon the silent subconscious.  The women (subconscious) are not truly silent; they are listening for the one clear assumption to fulfil.  If the conscious mind continually interrupts itself with doubt and confusion, the subconscious cannot act.  The lesson: cultivate a single, powerful assumption&mdash;then let your subconscious work its creative magic in perfect silence.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>3. Romans 1:26-27 &ndash; &ldquo;God gave them up to dishonourable passions&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Judgment of sexual orientation.<br/>
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> &ldquo;God&rdquo; here is your own subconscious reflecting back the conscious assumptions you hold.  When the conscious mind assumes separation, shame or fear, the subconscious &ldquo;gives you up&rdquo; to exactly that inner state&mdash;bringing discordant experiences as proof of your own limiting beliefs.  To change the reflection, change the assumption: dwell in the feeling of unity, love and self-acceptance, and the subconscious will return images and experiences that match.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>4. Matthew 7:13-14 &ndash; &ldquo;The gate is narrow&hellip; few find it&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Exclusion from salvation.<br/>
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> The narrow gate is the precise moment when a conscious assumption must slip through the subconscious barrier of old beliefs.  It is narrow because we resist new, expansive assumptions.  Only when the conscious mind insists&mdash;no matter how small the door may seem&mdash;and pushes its new assumption through, will the subconscious admit it and reconstruct reality accordingly.  The &ldquo;few&rdquo; are simply those who persevere in that single assumption.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>5. John 14:6 &ndash; &ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Religious exclusivity.<br/>
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the conscious &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; that assumes an identity.  This verse is the declaration of the Law of Assumption itself: the conscious &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; is the creative power that directs the subconscious.  When you assume &ldquo;I AM loved,&rdquo; &ldquo;I AM free,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I AM whole,&rdquo; the subconscious moves to manifest those truths.  There is no other &ldquo;way&rdquo; beyond the conscious assumption of your desired state.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>6. Exodus 21:20-21 &ndash; &ldquo;If a man strikes his servant&hellip;&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Justification of slavery.<br/>
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> The servant is the subconscious mind being &ldquo;struck&rdquo; by conflicting assumptions.  If the conscious mind alternately beats the subconscious with doubt and hope, the subconscious becomes &ldquo;bruised&rdquo; and confused&mdash;bringing pain into life.  The Bible&rsquo;s real injunction is to treat your subconscious with consistency and respect: hold a single, positive assumption and watch your servant mind transform your world without suffering.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>In Summary</h3>
<p>Every command and story in Scripture describes the dance between your conscious assumptions (the men) and your creative subconscious (the women).  When you understand that &ldquo;the kingdom of God is within,&rdquo; you see that every &ldquo;law&rdquo; is really an explanation of how to use your imagination.  Assume only what you wish to see, maintain that assumption&mdash;as narrowly or boldly as needed&mdash;and your subconscious will shape your outer world to match.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
