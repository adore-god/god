<h1>Ecclesiastes 10: Neville Goddard and the Discipline of Imagination</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>There comes a moment—terrifying in its clarity—when you realise that the outer world is shaped by how you see yourself. This is the "fear of God".</p><p>Neville Goddard called imagination <strong>God</strong>, and taught that every circumstance is born from what you’ve accepted as true within. <em>Ecclesiastes 10</em>, often overlooked, reads like a masterclass in the consequences of an undisciplined inner life when interpreted from this understanding.</p><hr><h3><strong>A Small Thought Can Spoil the Whole Atmosphere</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Dead flies make the oil of the perfume-maker evil-smelling; so a little foolish behaviour is of more weight than wisdom and honour.</strong> <em>(Ecclesiastes 10:1)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Your perfume—your consciousness—can be ruined by just one contradiction. A single inner “but what if it doesn’t work?” spoils the entire assumption of success. Neville taught that our reality is shaped by <strong>states</strong>, and states are delicate. The smallest doubt can unravel a creation in progress. This is why inner discipline matters.</p><hr><h3><strong>Your Direction Is Your Destiny</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>The heart of the wise man goes in the right direction; but the heart of a foolish man in the wrong.</strong> <em>(Ecclesiastes 10:2)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This isn’t about morality, but about <strong>focus</strong>. “Right” symbolises power. The wise place their imagination on what is good, true, and lovely. The fool dwells on appearances and fears. The direction of your <strong>heart</strong>—your imaginative attention—determines your world.</p><hr><h3><strong>You Can’t Hide Your Inner State</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>And when the foolish man is walking in the way, he has no sense, and lets everyone see that he is foolish.</strong> <em>(Ecclesiastes 10:3)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Your state reveals itself. Neville often said your world reflects your <strong>assumptions</strong>. If you believe you’re unworthy, it will show. You don’t need to speak your inner story—it tells itself through your outer conditions.</p><hr><h3><strong>Do Not Flee Your State</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>If the spirit of the ruler is angry with you, do not give up your place; for calm puts great offences to rest.</strong> <em>(Ecclesiastes 10:4)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The “ruler” is your <strong>dominant inner state</strong>. When fear rises, don’t give up your assumption of being who you desire to be. Stay there. Calmness—faithful persistence—quiets the storm. Don’t let emotion dethrone your chosen state.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Inverted World of Outer Appearances</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which comes by chance from a ruler: The foolish are placed in high positions, but men of wealth are kept low. I have seen servants on horses, and rulers walking on the earth as servants.</strong> <em>(Ecclesiastes 10:5–7)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is the world <strong>out of order</strong>—when imagination is forgotten. The “fool” (reactive thought) is exalted, and the “rich” (creative power) is disregarded. When you forget that <strong>imagination governs reality</strong>, life seems backwards.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Consequences of Mental Indulgence</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>He who makes a hole in a wall may be bitten by a snake; he who is pulling down a house will be hurt by it.</strong> <em>(Ecclesiastes 10:8)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To dig a mental pit—by judging, fearing, or worrying—is to fall into it. Break the wall of inner discipline, and the serpent (the subconscious reacting to those thoughts) will strike. <strong>You create your own consequences.</strong></p><hr><h3><strong>Effort Without Alignment Exhausts</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>He who gets out stones from the earth will be damaged by them, and in chopping wood there is danger. If the iron is not sharp, and he does not get it sharp, then he must put out more strength: but wisdom is for a profit in guiding.</strong> <em>(Ecclesiastes 10:9–10)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Effort without <strong>vision</strong> wears you out. Chopping at life with a blunt inner tool—without alignment or right imagining—leads to burnout. Imagination <strong>sharpens the iron</strong>. Wisdom knows that assumption comes before action.</p><hr><h3><strong>Charm the Serpent Within</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>If a snake comes out without being stopped by the snake-charmer, there is no use in the charmer.</strong> <em>(Ecclesiastes 10:11)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>If you don’t charm the snake—discipline the subconscious—it will bite. Your thoughts are always casting shadows. If your imagination runs wild, your world will too. <strong>Charm your inner serpent</strong> with conscious, controlled feeling.</p><hr><h3><strong>Speech Reveals State</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>The words of a wise man's mouth are sweet to all, but the lips of a foolish man are his destruction. The first words of his mouth are foolish, and the end of his talk is evil error.</strong> <em>(Ecclesiastes 10:12–13)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>What you speak, even in self-talk, reveals the <strong>state you dwell in</strong>. The wise speak from imagination fulfilled. The foolish speak out of reaction and lack. The end of undisciplined talk is always defeat.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Madness of Overthinking</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>He takes up much with talking; but still the man has no knowledge of what will be; and who is able to say what will be after him?</strong> <em>(Ecclesiastes 10:14)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Talk, analysis, and overthinking cannot replace <strong>assumption</strong>. The future is shaped in imagination, not speculation. The one who talks much often does little, because he has forgotten that feeling is the secret.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
