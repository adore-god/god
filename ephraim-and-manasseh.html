<h1>Ephraim and Manasseh</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<blockquote> 
"And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured." — Genesis 41:49
</blockquote>
<p>Then, in Genesis 41:50–52, Joseph’s two sons are born to him in Egypt before the famine years begin:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came… And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house. And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The names <a href="scrolls/label-joseph-series.html">Joseph</a> chose are not casual, but deeply symbolic. In them we see the spiritual pattern of manifestation: first forgetting, then abundance - the theme of Joseph's teaching.</p><hr><h2>Joseph’s Theme: Imagination Over Limitation</h2><p>Throughout Joseph’s story, outer circumstances try to bind him, yet he consistently rises above them through inner vision:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="the-hatred-of-brothers-imagining.html"><strong>Sold by his brothers</strong> </a>→ he rises in Potiphar’s house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="joseph-and-potiphars-wife-resisting.html">Tempted and falsely accused by Potiphar’s wife</a></strong> → he resists misuse of imagination and rises in prison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="butler-baker-and-can-power-of-inner.html">Forgotten by the butler</a></strong> → he continues to interpret dreams faithfully and rises to Pharaoh’s right hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Famine in the land</strong> → Joseph’s foresight, rooted in abundance, sustains nations.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The pattern is clear: Joseph represents <strong>imagination refusing to be limited by appearances</strong>. Each apparent setback becomes the ground for a greater ascent.</p><hr><h2>Asenath: Belonging to Neith</h2><p>The mother of Ephraim and Manasseh is <strong>Asenath (אָסְנַת, ʾĀsnath, Strong’s H621)</strong>, whose name means <em>“belonging to Neith,”</em> the <a href="scrolls/label-egypt-series.html">Egyptian</a> goddess of wisdom and weaving/destiny.</p><p>She was the daughter of <strong>Potiphera</strong>, priest of <strong>On</strong> (Heliopolis, the city of the sun). On was <a href="scrolls/label-egypt-series.html">Egypt’s</a> religious centre, associated with Ra, the sun god, and therefore a symbol of illumination and consciousness.</p><p>Symbolically:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asenath</strong> represents the outer world’s wisdom, structure, and framework of destiny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potiphera</strong> links Joseph’s line to the sun — the governing symbol of awareness and light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From this union, the children born represent imagination bearing fruit <strong>through the very framework of the world</strong> that once afflicted him.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Even though born of an Egyptian mother, <strong>Jacob later adopts Ephraim and Manasseh as his own (Genesis 48:5)</strong> — showing that the fruits of imagination, though appearing through “foreign” channels, are gathered into Israel, the inheritance of spiritual awakening.</p><hr><h2>Manasseh: Forgetting the Past</h2><p>Joseph named his firstborn <strong>Manasseh</strong>, meaning <em>“to forget.”</em> He said, <em>“God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.”</em></p><p>Manasseh symbolises the first step of manifestation: releasing the past. Neville Goddard taught that imagination cannot bring forth new experience if it is bound to memory. To create, you must <strong>die to the former state</strong>. Manasseh is this mental act of forgetting toil, sorrow, and limitation, clearing the ground for something new.</p><hr><h2>Ephraim: Fruitfulness in Affliction</h2><p>The second son was called <strong>Ephraim</strong>, meaning <em>“fruitful.”</em> Joseph explained, <em>“God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.”</em></p><p>Ephraim symbolises the second step: fruitfulness, manifestation, and abundance. The paradox is that abundance springs forth in the very place of affliction. In Neville’s language, once the past state is forgotten (Manasseh), imagination naturally bears fruit (Ephraim). </p><p>This is Joseph’s principle of storing grain in plenty so that famine becomes abundance: <strong>thinking abundantly in times of lack</strong>.</p><hr><h2>The Two Sons Together</h2><p>Taken together, Ephraim and Manasseh embody the whole pattern of manifestation:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Manasseh</strong> → Forget the toil, sorrow, and past states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ephraim</strong> → Bear fruit abundantly, even in the land of affliction.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Born of Asenath, they remind us that imagination does not bypass the framework of the world — it works through it, transforming affliction into abundance.</p>
