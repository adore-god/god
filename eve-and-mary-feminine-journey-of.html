<h1>Eve and Mary: The Feminine Journey of Imagination</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">



<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, every biblical figure represents a state of consciousness or a part of the human mind. Two of the most important are <strong>Eve</strong> and <strong>Mary</strong>. They illustrate the journey of imagination—from misuse to correct use—and show how we create our reality through assumption.</p>

<hr>
<h3><strong>Eve: Imagination Turned Outward</strong></h3>
<blockquote> 
“When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye … she took some and ate it.” — Genesis 3:6
</blockquote> 
<p>In Genesis, <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Eve</a> eats from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, often called the “fall” of man. Eve represents imagination turned outward—relying on senses and external appearances rather than inner awareness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eve</strong> shows what happens when we forget that reality is shaped by our assumptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we focus on external events and appearances, we give power to what is outside us. This creates the illusion of separation and limitation—the belief that cause and effect exist independently of our imagination.</p>

<hr>
<h3><strong>The Sleep of Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>Eve also represents imagination “asleep.” She sees the world as fixed and bound by facts, unaware of its creative potential. This is the starting point of limitation and suffering. Yet even here, Neville points out that imagination itself—the same power that caused the fall—is also the means for redemption.</p>

<hr>
<h3><strong>Mary: Imagination Awakened</strong></h3>

<blockquote> 
"But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart." — Luke 2:19
</blockquote> 

<p>Mary represents imagination refined and devoted. Unlike Eve, she does not rely on the external world. Her conception of Jesus through the Holy Spirit symbolizes receiving an idea from within—assuming it as true—and nurturing it into reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mary shows that imagination, when consciously assumed, creates reality.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through Mary, Neville emphasizes that belief in the unseen—faith in the idea within—is the key to manifestation. By assuming the state of the fulfilled desire, we bring it into our experience.</p>

<hr>
<h3><strong>From Eve to Mary: The Law of Assumption in Action</strong></h3>
<p>The contrast between Eve and Mary illustrates how consciousness shifts through assumption:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eve:</strong> imagination directed outward, identifying with appearances and separation.</li>
<li><strong>Mary:</strong> imagination aligned with inner truth, consciously creating reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eve represents the “fall” caused by assuming limitation. Mary represents the “rise” that occurs when we assume the state of our fulfilled desire and live from that assumption.</p>

<hr>
<h3><strong>Imagination Within Us All</strong></h3>
<p>Neville teaches that these archetypes are not limited by gender—they exist in everyone. When we focus on facts, fear, and external conditions, we are in an “Eve” state. When we assume our desired state and live from it, we are in a “Mary” state. By doing this, we give birth to the awakened, creative self.</p>

<hr>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Using Imagination to Create Reality</strong></h3>
<p>The stories of Eve and Mary are guides for how imagination works in practice. Eve shows what happens when we assume limitation. Mary shows what happens when we assume the state we want to experience. Neville’s key teaching is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Imagination is God in action.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By consciously assuming the state of our desire and living from it, we create our reality and move from limitation to full expression of our creative power.</p>
