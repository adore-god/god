    <h1>John 13:3</h1>
    <p>Neville Goddard’s interpretation of John 13:3 would likely focus on the symbolic meanings and the psychological principles underlying the passage. The verse reads:</p>
<p><strong>"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God."</strong> (John 13:3, KJV)</p>
<p>For Neville, this verse would not be a literal historical event but rather a depiction of an inner psychological truth. Goddard often emphasized that "Jesus" represents the individual’s higher consciousness or imagination, and that the "Father" symbolizes the creative power of the mind, or God within.</p>
<p>Here’s how Neville might interpret this passage:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands"</strong>: This would suggest that the individual (represented by Jesus) recognizes the power of their imagination and that everything they experience in life is a result of their inner thoughts and beliefs. The "Father" is the source of all creative power, and this power is given to you—through your imagination and belief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"He was come from God"</strong>: Neville often taught that we are all divine beings who come from the infinite creative source (God). This would point to the idea that our consciousness or imagination is a direct extension of this divine source, and our true nature is rooted in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"And went to God"</strong>: This would symbolize the return to the source, or the realization of one's divinity. It is the process of returning to the understanding that you are, in fact, one with the creative power of the universe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, Neville Goddard would likely interpret this verse as an affirmation of the power of your imagination and the realization that you are a creative being, able to shape your reality through your thoughts and beliefs, all rooted in the divine essence that you ultimately come from and return to.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-john-series.html">John Series</a></p>
