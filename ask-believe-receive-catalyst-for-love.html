<blockquote>
"My vineyard, my very own, is before me.." &mdash; Song of Solomon 8:12
</blockquote>
<p>When people first hear the phrase <em>&ldquo;Ask, believe, receive,&rdquo;</em> it can sound like a spiritual vending machine. But this principle, highlighted again and again by <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> in the Gospels, is not about making requests to a distant <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a>&nbsp;(we left the idea of an external retributive God with <a href="job-and-law-of-assumption-inner-crisis.html">Job</a>) &mdash;it&rsquo;s about an inner relationship: the sacred interplay of desire, imagination, and feeling. It's significant that it's a phrase spoken by <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> in all <a href="why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">four gospels</a>:</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.&rdquo;<br/> &mdash; Matthew 7:7<br/><br/>&ldquo;And whatever you ask for in prayer, if you have faith, you will receive it.&rdquo;<br/>&mdash; Matthew 21:22<br/><br/>&ldquo;Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.&rdquo;<br/> &mdash; Mark 11:24 <br/> <br/>"And I say to you: Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.&rdquo;<div>&mdash; Luke 11:9<br/><br/>&ldquo;Up to now you have made no request in my name: do so, and it will be answered, so <b>that your hearts may be full of joy</b>.&rdquo;<br/> &mdash; John 16:24</div></blockquote><div></div><div>
<p>These verses are not instructions to beg, but invitations to <strong>assume</strong>. <a href="only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard</a> taught that these teachings reveal not a system of petition, but a law of consciousness. When read symbolically, the Gospels unfold like the inner anatomy of prayer&mdash;a guide to the imaginal act <a href="why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">rooted in the teachings of the Old Testament patriarchs</a>. Click here to find out why there are <a href="why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">four Gospels</a> in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Neville understood this deeply. To him, the Bible was a psychological guidebook dressed up in history. And hidden within its earliest stories is the very mechanism behind &ldquo;Ask, believe, receive.&rdquo; In fact, the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">original catalyst</a> for all biblical creation lies in this verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Genesis 2:24</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Inner Marriage of Desire and Feeling</strong></h3>
<p>Read symbolically, this is not a statement about human <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-marriage-series.html">marriage</a>&mdash;it is a formula for manifestation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Leaving father and mother</strong> = turning away from outer evidence, inherited beliefs, and old conditioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cleave to his wife</strong> = uniting with your new raised assumption through feeling and imagination. The <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html">crucifixion of Jesus is the ultimate cleaving</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Becoming one flesh</strong> = manifestation&mdash;what is felt within is externalised without.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Neville says, <em>&ldquo;Imagination is the beginning of creation. You imagine what you desire, and then you believe it to be true.&rdquo;</em> This is the deeper essence of <em>Ask, believe, receive.</em></p>
<p>This inner union is portrayed most tenderly in the <strong>Song of Solomon</strong>&mdash;a book often misunderstood or overlooked, yet rich in spiritual symbolism. It is central in the Bible both literally and figuratively. The lover's longing in the Song is not for a physical romance, but a <a href="genesis-224-love.html">mystical cleaving to love</a> itself. It is the soul reaching for the Beloved&mdash;unashamed, exposed, persistent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Song of Solomon 1:2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, desire is elevated to devotion, and the seeking is not desperate, but worshipful. This is what it means to <em>ask</em>: to reach inward with reverence and emotional depth.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Ask: The Act of Reaching for the Delightful</strong></h3>
<p>To ask is not to plead. It is to form a desire, to reach in thought for what delights you. Yet here lies the struggle: the human mind, if untended, often returns to self-doubt, guilt, or unworthiness. It is bogged down by what Neville calls the &ldquo;outer man&rdquo;&mdash;a self-image shaped by facts and failures.</p>
<p>So the true asking begins when you choose to reach upward in consciousness. You dare to say, <em>&ldquo;<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> worthy of joy,&rdquo;</em> even if nothing in your outer world confirms it. Asking is an act of rebellion against self-depreciation. It is the planting of a seed&mdash;not in desperation, but in delight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Change your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard, Your Faith is Your Fortune</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Song of Solomon</strong> echoes this upward stretch of the soul. The beloved asks not with timidity, but with fervour&mdash;because love is her right. She delights in her beloved, and in turn, becomes delightful.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Believe: Cleaving to the Inner State</strong></h3>
<p>Believing is not hoping. It is <strong>assuming the feeling</strong> of the wish fulfilled, as though it were already so. In the Genesis verse, this is the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">cleaving</a>&mdash;the deep union with your inner conviction.</p>
<p>This is where most people falter. They ask, but they do not remain faithful to the desire. They return to old doubts, old states. But belief means <em>cleaving</em> to the delightful thought, not allowing the subconscious to be impregnated by fear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;You rise to a higher level of being by assuming the feeling of your wish fulfilled.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard, Feeling is the Secret</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Song of Solomon</strong> reflects this same devotion. The beloved searches through the streets in the night, asking,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Have you seen him who is my heart's desire?&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; <em>Song of Solomon 3:3</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is emotional fidelity&mdash;a refusal to let go of what the heart has seen within. Belief is not passive. It <em>pursues.</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Receive: The Birth of the Imagined</strong></h3>
<p>Once the inner union is complete&mdash;once imagination (the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>) has faithfully cleaved to feeling (the <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">wife</a>)&mdash;the manifestation must come. &ldquo;One flesh&rdquo; becomes the body of your world. What is held within will be expressed without.</p>
<p>This is not reward, it is law. As Neville often said, <em>&ldquo;You do not attract what you want, you attract what you are.&rdquo;</em> If you are one with the state of already having it, reality conforms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My beloved is mine, and I <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">AM</a> his.&rdquo;<br/>
&mdash; <em>Song of Solomon 2:16</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the language of manifestation. Not <em>&ldquo;I hope he will love me,&rdquo;</em> but <em>&ldquo;<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> his.&rdquo;</em> The inner state is claimed in certainty. Therefore, it must become flesh.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Why It Must Be Delightful</strong></h3>
<p>Here lies your insight: asking, believing, and receiving are only effective when your inner state is joyful, uplifting, and clear. The subconscious, like a fertile womb, responds to whatever is impressed upon it&mdash;but especially to <strong>feeling</strong>. If you dwell in fear, that too is received.</p>
<p>This is why the Bible continually calls for praise, rejoicing, and thanksgiving&mdash;not for moral reasons, but because these are the vibrational moods of creation.</p>
<p>To truly manifest, you must reach for the good&mdash;not as escapism, but as an act of spiritual fidelity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, and live in that assumption as though it were true.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>In Summary</strong></h3><div>The holy trinity:</div>
<p><strong>Ask</strong> = Reach for what delights you. Desire with joy, not lack.<br/>
<strong>Believe</strong> = Marry that desire in feeling. Cleave to it with devotion.<br/>
<strong>Receive</strong> = Live from it. It will externalise.</p>
<p>This is not a technique. It is a transformation. The Bible gives us a pattern of inner union&mdash;from Genesis to Revelation&mdash;and Neville shows us that it always begins with the choice to dwell in the delightful.</p>
<p>In <strong>Song of Solomon</strong>, we find the soul in full submission to its love, asking not to be shamed but to be fulfilled. This is the emotional core of manifestation: not commanding the world to change, but wooing it inwardly with beauty, fidelity, and delight.</p>
<blockquote>"Go after love; still desiring to have the things which the Spirit gives, but most of all that you may have the prophet's power.." &mdash; 1 Corinthians 14:1</blockquote>
