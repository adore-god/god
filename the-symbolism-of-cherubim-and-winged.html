<img alt="Cherubim Icon The Way" src="images/wp/cherubim.webp"/>
<p>Cherubim appear repeatedly in the Bible, often in moments of divine revelation: guarding <a href="scrolls/label-eden-series.html">Eden</a>, overshadowing the Ark of the Covenant, or surrounding God’s throne. At first glance, they seem distant or mystical, but in truth, they represent <strong>the very <a href="elohim-god.html">structure and power of imagination</a></strong> — the faculty through which consciousness shapes reality.</p><p>The placement of cherubim near the divine presence signals <strong>both protection and nearness</strong>. They mark the threshold where conscious thought meets creative power, safeguarding the inner sanctum of awareness while enabling alignment with <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">the I AM.</a></p><hr/><h2>Cherubim in the Garden of Eden: Guarding Consciousness</h2><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Biblical Reference: Genesis 3:24</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p>"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."</p></blockquote>
The Garden of Eden represents the <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">unspoiled inner state of consciousness</a>, where imagination flows freely. The cherubim guard this space, creating an <strong>ordered, protected environment</strong> for creative awareness. The flaming sword is imagination itself — sharp, discerning, and active — distinguishing thoughts aligned with divine potential from those that would obstruct it.<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Proverbs 4:23</em> – "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life."</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Cherubim safeguard the purity of imagination, ensuring that consciousness remains fertile for creation.</p><hr/><h2>The Ark of the Covenant: Overshadowing the Divine Presence</h2><p><strong>Biblical Reference: Exodus 25:18-22</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work… And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims…"</p></blockquote><p>
The Ark represents the inner sanctuary of consciousness, where <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">divine presence resides</a>. The cherubim, wings outstretched, signify imagination — <strong>both protective and revealing</strong>. Their closeness demonstrates that access to creative power is always guarded, but available to those whose awareness is aligned.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>1 Kings 8:10-11</em> – “The cloud filled the house of the LORD, so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Cherubim here symbolise imagination as a protective, ordering force — maintaining the sacred space where conscious creativity meets divine insight.</p><hr/><h2>Ezekiel’s Vision: Harmonised Imagination</h2><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Biblical Reference: Ezekiel 1:4-28</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p>"And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a man, the second face was the face of a lion, the third face was the face of an ox, and the fourth face was the face of an eagle."</p></blockquote><p>
The <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">four faces</a> of the cherubim represent the dimensions of imagination:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Man:</strong> conscious awareness, discernment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lion:</strong> courage and dominion over the mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ox:</strong> persistence, steady effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eagle:</strong> higher perspective, transcendence.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Imagination functions as a <strong>structured, balanced force</strong>, combining awareness, courage, persistence, and vision. The cherubim show that creation arises from a harmonised interplay of these faculties.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Ezekiel 10:20</em> – “These are the living creatures that I saw under the God of Israel…”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Cherubim illustrate the disciplined, integrated faculties of imagination that shape reality.</p><hr/><h2>Seraphim in Isaiah: Purification and Higher Insight</h2><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Biblical Reference: Isaiah 6:1-7</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p>"Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings… And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory."</p></blockquote><p>
Seraphim represent <strong>purified imagination</strong>. Wings over the face suggest insight beyond ordinary perception; wings over the feet indicate grounded application. Their <a href="crowned-from-within-defining-your-i-am.html">continual praise</a> reflects alignment with the divine and the disciplined affirmation of creative power.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Isaiah 6:3</em> – “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Purified imagination aligns with divine truth, enabling creation from clarity, power, and presence.</p><hr/><h2>Revelation: Imagination Perfected</h2><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Biblical Reference: Revelation 4:6-11</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p>"And before the throne were four beasts full of eyes… and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty…"</p></blockquote><p>
These winged creatures represent <strong>fully disciplined, perfected imagination</strong> — consciousness wholly aligned with the I AM. Their constant praise signals the joy and continual creation that arises from alignment. Cherubim here are both <strong>protectors and expressions of creative power</strong>, maintaining order while enabling manifestation.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Revelation 4:11</em> – “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power…”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Cherubim in Revelation embody imagination’s full potential: ordered, aligned, and constantly creative.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion: Cherubim as Guardians and Guides</h2><p>Cherubim are not distant beings, but <strong>symbols of the inner creative faculty</strong>. From Eden to the Ark, Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Revelation, they reveal the <strong>structure, protection, and harmonisation</strong> of imagination. They guard consciousness, maintain sacred space, and align thought with divine potential.</p><p>In essence, cherubim show that imagination is <strong>both the threshold and the path</strong> to creation — disciplined, ordered, and always near to the I AM.</p>
