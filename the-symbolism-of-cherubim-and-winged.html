<p></p><div><img alt="Cherubim Icon The Way" border="0" data-original-height="1048" data-original-width="977" height="200" src="images/20250528_072602_0000.webp" width="186"/></div>In the Bible, cherubim and other winged creatures often appear in moments of divine revelation, guarding sacred spaces, or surrounding God’s throne. At first glance, these figures may seem like distant, mystical beings, but through Neville Goddard's lens, they represent deep, symbolic truths about our inner world—particularly our imagination and its power to shape our reality.<p></p>
<p>Let’s explore these winged beings as symbols of consciousness, imagination, and the process of manifestation, supported by key Bible verses.</p>
<h4>1. <strong>Cherubim in the Garden of Eden: The Guarding of Consciousness</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Biblical Reference:</strong> <em>Genesis 3:24</em><br>
"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville’s Interpretation:</strong><br>
The Garden of Eden represents the inner, unspoiled state of our consciousness, where we are directly connected to our creative power—the imagination. The cherubim guarding the entrance symbolize the subconscious mind, which can either protect or block our access to this power based on our beliefs. The "flaming sword" is the sharp distinction between what we imagine consciously and what is allowed into our awareness. This guarding mechanism is necessary to ensure we do not give power to thoughts that contradict our divine potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supporting Bible Verses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Proverbs 4:23</em> – "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Matthew 6:22-23</em> – "The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness."</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The cherubim guard the purity of our creative space, reminding us that our inner world must be protected from conflicting thoughts and doubts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. <strong>The Ark of the Covenant: The Divine Presence Within</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Biblical Reference:</strong> <em>Exodus 25:18-22</em><br>
"And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat… And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville’s Interpretation:</strong><br>
The Ark of the Covenant represents the inner sanctum of your own consciousness, where divine power resides. The cherubim, with their wings outstretched, are symbolic of the imagination—your creative faculty that overshadows and protects this inner sanctuary. The wings represent the freedom and limitless nature of your imagination. When you align your thoughts with divine ideas, you unlock the transformative power within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supporting Bible Verses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>1 Corinthians 3:16</em> – "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Luke 17:21</em> – "Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you."</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The cherubim on the Ark symbolize the imagination, which, when directed in harmony with divine law, brings about manifestation and spiritual growth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. <strong>Ezekiel’s Vision: The Power of Imagination to Shape Reality</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Biblical Reference:</strong> <em>Ezekiel 1:4-28</em><br>
"And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire… And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a man, and the second face was the face of a lion, and the third face was the face of an ox, and the fourth face was the face of an eagle."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville’s Interpretation:</strong><br>
The four faces of the cherubim symbolize different aspects of human imagination and consciousness. The face of the <em>man</em> represents the creative will—the ability to consciously direct your thoughts. The <em>lion</em> symbolizes courage and strength, the power to bring your desires into reality. The <em>ox</em> represents steady, consistent action, and the <em>eagle</em> symbolizes the higher perspective, the ability to transcend earthly limitations through spiritual insight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supporting Bible Verses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Philippians 4:13</em> – "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Romans 12:2</em> – "And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The cherubim in Ezekiel’s vision symbolize the facets of our inner imagination that, when in alignment, create the life we desire. Each face represents a different quality of thought and action needed for successful manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. <strong>Seraphim in Isaiah’s Vision: Purification Through Imagination</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Biblical Reference:</strong> <em>Isaiah 6:1-7</em><br>
"In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings… And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville’s Interpretation:</strong><br>
The seraphim represent purified imagination. The wings covering their faces suggest that our higher, spiritual imagination is beyond ordinary human perception—it operates on a higher plane. The wings covering their feet symbolize the need to keep our thoughts grounded in truth, while the constant declaration of God’s holiness represents the practice of affirming the divine nature of our imagination. When we purify our thoughts and beliefs, we align with our highest potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supporting Bible Verses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Matthew 5:8</em> – "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>James 1:21</em> – "Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The seraphim are a reminder that our imagination must be purified—free from limiting beliefs and negative thoughts—so we can manifest from a place of divine truth and power.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. <strong>Winged Creatures in Revelation: The Divine Power of Consciousness</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Biblical Reference:</strong> <em>Revelation 4:6-9</em><br>
"And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind… And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville’s Interpretation:</strong><br>
In Neville’s framework, these winged creatures represent the ultimate expression of the imagination in its perfected form. Their constant praise and worship reflect the alignment of their consciousness with the divine. These beings are not separate from us but symbolize our own higher consciousness, which, when fully aligned with divine law, leads to constant creation and manifestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supporting Bible Verses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Colossians 1:16</em> – "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>John 4:24</em> – "God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The winged creatures in Revelation represent the power of consciousness fully aligned with divine law. Their praise reflects the joyful expression of a mind that understands and harnesses the power of imagination.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion: The Cherubim and Winged Creatures as Symbols of the Imagination</h3>
<p>Through Neville Goddard’s lens, cherubim and other winged creatures are not distant, ethereal beings, but rather symbols of the creative power within each of us. They represent different aspects of our imagination: the guard of our subconscious, the divine presence within, the multiple facets of our creative will, the need for purification, and the ultimate power of consciousness aligned with divine law.</p>
<p>By understanding these creatures as representations of our own inner creative faculties, we can unlock the full potential of our imagination and manifest our desires with greater clarity and purpose.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-architecture-series.html" class="noTag">Architecture Series</a></p>
