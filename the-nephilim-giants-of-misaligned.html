<h1>The Nephilim: Giants of Misaligned Imagination</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The Bible, when read symbolically, is a manual of the mind. It is <strong>psychological truth disguised as ancient history</strong>, and its every verse reveals the creative power of imagination. Genesis opens with this message: <em>“The Spirit of God hovered over the waters”</em> (Genesis 1:2)—<strong>spirit and soul first unite</strong>. In Genesis 1:11, we’re told that creation happens with the <strong>“seed in itself”</strong>—a clear symbol of inner creation, the self-contained potency of imagination. Then Genesis 1:26 declares, <em>“Let Us make man in Our image”</em>—the union of <strong>conscious and subconscious</strong>, the divine marriage from which all manifestation proceeds.</p>
<p>Read this way, the Bible becomes a revelation of how thought shapes experience—how states of consciousness form our outer world. It is a return to Eden not by geography, but by inner realisation. Which brings us to a strange and often sensationalised term from Genesis 6: <strong>the Nephilim</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Giants of Genesis</h3>
<p>Genesis 6:4 tells of the Nephilim—translated by many as “giants.” Some have called them fallen angels, others ancient hybrids of heaven and earth. But if we read Scripture through the frame Neville Goddard gave us, these are not physical creatures but <strong>states of consciousness</strong>: distorted, towering beliefs born from the misdirection of creative power.</p>
<p>Neville taught that the Bible’s events occur <strong>not in the world, but in the imagination</strong>. Every character and event symbolises a psychological truth. So when we read that the “sons of God” went in to the “daughters of men,” and from this union came giants, we’re being shown something profound.</p>
<p>The <strong>sons of God</strong> represent the divine spark of imagination. The <strong>daughters of men</strong> symbolise outer reasoning—sensory perception, logic, and worldly thought. When imagination unites with appearance rather than truth, it conceives <strong>distorted inner conditions</strong>. Giants, yes—but giants of fear, limitation, doubt, and pride. These are the Nephilim: towering assumptions that block the promised land within.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Giants of the Inner World</h3>
<p>These giants still walk the earth—not physically, but <strong>psychologically</strong>. They are the beliefs we carry that seem larger than ourselves: “I’m not worthy.” “This problem is too big.” “Change is impossible.” Such inner giants shape our lives by shaping our self-image. In Neville’s terms, they are the fruit of imagining from separation—not from the divine root of “I AM.”</p>
<p>In the Book of Numbers, the Israelites see themselves as “grasshoppers” in the presence of these giants—another glimpse of how perception determines outcome. The Nephilim don’t only dominate; they <strong>diminish</strong>. They shrink our sense of possibility. They cause us to forget our creative origin.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Casting Down the Nephilim</h3>
<p>Overcoming the Nephilim is not about battling monsters—it’s about reclaiming the power of imagination. Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 10:5: <em>“Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God.”</em> These “high things” are the giants—the towering false beliefs that challenge the truth of “I AM.”</p>
<p>To cast them down is to recognise that they were imagined into being—and can be imagined away. Neville taught that everything begins with inner acceptance. By choosing a new state, a new assumption of being, we change the world without lifting a finger.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Nephilim are not the stuff of ancient mystery, but of present misbelief. They fall the moment we return to truth—the moment we remember that imagination is the only creative power, and that all giants are shadows cast by forgetting who we really are.</strong></p>
