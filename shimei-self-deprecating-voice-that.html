<h1>Shimei: The Self-Deprecating Voice That Always Seems to Haunt Us</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">


<p>In the biblical narrative, few characters appear so fleetingly yet with such emotional force as <strong>Shimei</strong>—the Benjamite who curses <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David the personified wish fulfilled</a> during his lowest moment. At first glance, Shimei seems little more than a spiteful heckler. But through the interpretive framework of Neville Goddard’s <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html"><strong>Law of Assumption</strong></a>, we uncover a deeper truth: Shimei is not just a man on a hill throwing stones—he is a mirror of the inner world.</p>

<p>Notably, Shimei appears within the wider <a href="samuel-summary-neville-goddard-style.html">Samuel narrative</a>—a period defined by inner tension rather than outward stability. This is the same era in which consciosness is caught between <strong>Saul</strong>, the aggressive and fearful former state, and <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html"><strong>David</strong>, the emerging beloved state</a>. Samuel’s very name is rooted in <em>shama</em>, “to hear,” signalling that these stories are fundamentally about <strong>listening</strong>—about discerning which inner voice to follow. Just as Saul represents <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">reaction, threat, and compulsion</a>, David represents trust, restraint, and assumption. Shimei surfaces precisely at this crossroads, embodying the hostile commentary that arises when the old state resists displacement by the new.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>The Story of Shimei: A Quick Recap</strong></h2>

<p>Shimei first appears in <strong>2 Samuel 16:5–13</strong>, where he hurls stones and insults at King David as he flees from his son Absalom. He accuses David of bloodshed and usurpation, claiming that David is now receiving what he deserves. David, rather than reacting in fury, restrains his men from harming Shimei, even suggesting that his cursing may be from the Lord.</p>

<p>Here is the passage from the Bible that captures this moment:</p>

<p><strong>2 Samuel 16:5–13 (NIV, abridged)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    As David approached Bahurim, Shimei came out cursing him, shouting,
    “Get out, you murderer, you scoundrel! The Lord has given the kingdom
    into the hands of your son Absalom.”
  
<br><br> 
    Abishai said to the king, “Why should this dog curse my lord the king?
    Let me go and cut off his head.”
<br><br> 
    But David said, “Leave him alone; let him curse, for the Lord has told
    him to. My own son seeks my life—how much more this Benjamite? It may
    be that the Lord will look upon my misery and restore blessing instead
    of this curse.”
<br><br> 
    So David continued on his way, while Shimei went along the hillside,
    cursing and throwing stones.
</blockquote>

<p>David’s restraint here offers a profound lesson: rather than reacting with anger, he <strong>acknowledges</strong> the curse without internalising it. This moment shows us how <strong>negative beliefs and accusations</strong>—no matter how strong—can be observed without allowing them to dominate our lives.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Shimei’s Name: The Voice You Choose to Hear</strong></h2>

<p>The name “Shimei” comes from the Hebrew root <em>shama</em> (שָׁמַע), meaning “to hear” or “to listen.” This is a crucial detail in understanding Shimei’s role. While he is throwing stones and cursing David, he is also symbolising the <strong>voice</strong> that you <strong>choose to listen to</strong> during moments of personal transformation. Shimei’s voice isn’t just about outward accusations—it reflects the <strong>inner dialogue</strong> that seeks attention and often arises when we are moving away from old patterns of thought.</p>

<p>This insight connects directly to Neville Goddard’s <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, which teaches that what we <strong>listen to</strong>—what we repeatedly consent to in thought—shapes our reality. In the <a href="samuel-summary-neville-goddard-style.html">Samuel narrative</a>, the struggle is not external kingship but internal allegiance: Saul’s fearful reasoning or David’s trusting assumption.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Shimei as a Symbol: Neville Goddard's Lens</strong></h2>

<p>According to Neville Goddard, “<strong>All that you behold, though it appears without, it is within, in your imagination.</strong>” The world, he taught, is a projection of our internal assumptions and states.</p>

<p>Goddard also emphasised that <strong>consciousness creates reality</strong>. In his framework, when we persist in certain assumptions—whether empowering or limiting—those assumptions become externalised in the world around us.</p>

<h3><strong>Shimei: The Inner Self-Critic or Self-Condemnation</strong></h3>

<p>Shimei’s accusations can be interpreted as the self-critical or self-condemning thoughts that surface when a person is transitioning into a new state. As David moves more fully into kingship, Shimei appears to accuse him of unworthiness. Likewise, when a new assumption begins to stabilise, the old Saul-like reasoning resurfaces to challenge it.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>David’s Restraint: Acknowledging Negative Thoughts</strong></h3>

<p>David’s refusal to silence Shimei immediately reflects discernment rather than passivity. He does not identify with the curse, nor does he fight it. This mirrors Neville’s teaching that thoughts need not be battled—only <strong>disentangled from belief</strong>. David hears the voice, but he does not enthrone it.</p>

<hr>

<h3><strong>Solomon’s Role: A New Assumption Must Be Protected</strong></h3>

<p>When Solomon later deals decisively with Shimei, it marks the point where a new state of consciousness is no longer negotiable. Solomon represents wisdom established. At this stage, old accusations are no longer tolerated—not out of anger, but out of clarity.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>The Deeper Message</strong></h2>

<p>Shimei represents the accusing voice that arises when identity is shifting. Saul represents the reactive state that listens to that voice. David represents the emerging state that hears but does not obey. Samuel—the act of hearing itself—stands behind the entire narrative.</p>

<p>The question throughout is simple: <strong>which voice will you follow?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Final Thought</strong></h2>

<p>Shimei may shout. Saul may threaten. But David listens differently. And that difference determines the outcome.</p>

<p>In Neville Goddard’s terms, this is the art of assumption: hearing without consenting, acknowledging without yielding, and persisting in the identity already assumed to be true.</p>
