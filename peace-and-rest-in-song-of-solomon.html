<h1>God Rested and the King of Peace: Pure Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The <em>Song of Solomon</em> is one of the most poetic and symbolically rich books of the Hebrew Bible. At its heart lies the intense and sacred relationship between Solomon, whose name means “peace” (שְׁלֹמֹה, <em>Shlomoh</em>), and the Shulammite bride, whose name suggests <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">completeness</a> and peace (<em>Shulammith</em>). Together, they represent the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">mental marriage</a> sparked by the concept of <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">ask, believe, receive</a>. — a metaphor for the spiritual peace that comes when <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">creation is imaginatively complete and the mind rests in its completed joyful form</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Meaning Behind the Names</h2>
<p><strong><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-solomon-series.html">Solomon</a></strong> derives from the Hebrew root <em>shalom</em> (שָׁלוֹם), encompassing meanings of peace, harmony, completeness, and wholeness. This name immediately evokes the state of rest and perfection that follows <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">completion</a> — a state central to the creation narrative and the spiritual journey.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="genesis-224-love.html">Shulammite bride</a></strong> (שׁוּלַמִּית) carries a name linked to <em>shalom</em> as well, often interpreted as “the peaceful one” or “the woman of peace.” She embodies the receptive and yearning aspect of consciousness — the soul’s longing for union with peace, wisdom, and rest.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Rest as Divine Fulfilment</h2>
<p>In the <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">creation account</a>, after the six days of forming and shaping, God rests on the seventh day (Genesis 2:2):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rest is not fatigue but a state of completion and harmony — the settling of creation into its perfect, peaceful order. It is the archetype of rest: a state where struggle ceases, and peace reigns.</p>
<p><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-solomon-series.html">Solomon</a>, as the “king of peace,” symbolises this divine rest realised within the human psyche — the inner king who rules from a place of calm and wholeness.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Bride’s Role: The Longing for Union and Peace</h2>
<p>The Shulammite’s voice throughout the <em><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-song-of-solomon-series.html">Song of Solomon</a></em> reflects the heart's longing to enter that realm of peace and rest. Her yearning is not impatience but a tender, sincere desire for harmony and belonging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Draw me after you; let us run. The king has brought me into his chambers.”</em> (Song of Solomon 1:4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gentle invitation evokes the intimate rest and safety found in union with Solomon — a metaphor for imagination finding its peace in the assumption.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Sacred Union: Symbol of Peace and Rest</h2>
<p>The interplay between Solomon and the Shulammite is more than romance; it is the symbolic union of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> with its perfected state. Their dialogue flows with images of beauty, protection, and serene confidence — all aspects of the peaceful rest that follows creative completion.</p>
<p>The Shulammite’s repeated return to Solomon’s embrace and the descriptions of their dwelling places reflect an inner sanctuary where peace (<em>shalom</em>) and rest abide. This sanctuary is a mirror of the creation’s seventh day rest, extended into the human heart and consciousness.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Peace in the Law of Assumption</h2>
<p>The law of Assumption, when understood through this symbolism, emphasises <strong>resting in the fulfilled state</strong> — embodying peace and completion without anxiety or striving. Just as God rested, the law invites us to cease resistance and rest quietly in the awareness that what we desire is already whole and complete.</p>
<p>Solomon’s peace is the resting place of the mind and spirit, while the Shulammite’s longing represents the creative power that awakens and draws us inward to that peace. Their meeting is the living allegory of divine rest manifesting in the human experience.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Solomon and the Shulammite bride in the <em>Song of Solomon</em> beautifully encapsulate the profound spiritual truth of <strong>rest, peace, and divine union</strong>. Their names, their love, and their sacred dialogue invite us to discover the rest that follows creation’s completion — the <em>shalom</em> that is both the beginning and the end of all true manifestation.</p>
<p>In this rest, we find not passivity, but a deep, dynamic peace — the foundation on which all creative power flows, echoing the sacred seventh day when God Himself rested.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
