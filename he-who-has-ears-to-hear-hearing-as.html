<h1>Hearing the Word of God</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Throughout Scripture, &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; signifies more than the physical sense&mdash;it is the inner reception of the <a href="the-word-seed-and-unity-of-consciousness.html">Word of God &mdash; the assumption </a>, the very <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed of manifestation</a> in your imagination. In Neville&rsquo;s system, nothing becomes real until it is first assumed and heard inwardly. Thus, hearing is the first step in the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">law of assumption</a>: you must accept a new state in imagination before it can appear in your outer world.</p><hr/><h2>The Continuum of Hearing: A Thread Running Through the Bible</h2><p>Every <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-names-and-genealogies-series.html">name</a> and story associated with hearing maps a stage in the unfolding of consciousness through imagination. As you move from Samuel to Shammah, you trace the journey from first assumption to the fixing of that assumption as reality.</p><h3>Samuel &ndash; &ldquo;God Has Heard&rdquo;</h3><p>Samuel&rsquo;s name and story represent the awakening of imagination. When he says, &ldquo;Speak, <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a>, for your servant hears,&rdquo; he enacts the law of assumption&rsquo;s opening act: inner stillness and willingness to receive a new conception. This is the moment of first assumption, when imagination listens and accepts the unseen Word.</p><h3>Simeon / Simon &ndash; &ldquo;He Who Has Heard&rdquo;</h3><p>Simeon in the temple and Simon Peter both illustrate recognition of what imagination has assumed. Simeon inwardly perceives the Christ child; Peter inwardly recognises Jesus as the Christ. In Neville&rsquo;s terms, their inner hearing yields unshakeable faith&mdash;a conviction born of imagination rather than outer proof.</p><h3>Shimei &ndash; &ldquo;Yah Has Heard&rdquo;</h3><p>Shimei&rsquo;s cursing of David symbolises the misuse of imagination: he has &ldquo;heard&rdquo; only negative appearances and assumed them as reality. Neville warns that the law of assumption works both ways&mdash;what you assume inwardly, whether positive or negative, will manifest. Shimei reminds us to govern our inner hearing with care.</p><h3>Peter &ndash; &ldquo;The Rock of Faith&rdquo;</h3><p>When Simon becomes Peter, he moves from hearing to fixing. Jesus declares, &ldquo;You are Peter&hellip;,&rdquo; and Neville interprets this as the moment when an assumption is so firmly held in imagination that it becomes the &ldquo;rock&rdquo; upon which new reality is built. Here, the law of assumption is in full effect: assume and persist until the outer world conforms.</p><h3>Ishmael &ndash; &ldquo;God Will Hear&rdquo;</h3><p>Ishmael&rsquo;s birth represents the emotional assumption&mdash;the soul&rsquo;s first cry of desire. Born of Hagar&rsquo;s fear, his name nevertheless shows that the law of assumption hears any inner desire. Even unconscious assumptions bear fruit; Ishmael reminds us that every inner state is recognised by imagination.</p><h3>Shemaiah &ndash; &ldquo;Heard by the Lord&rdquo;</h3><p>As a prophet who both hears and acts, Shemaiah embodies the application of the law of assumption. He listens inwardly and then expresses that reality outwardly. In Neville&rsquo;s framework, this is the stage where imagination guides your thoughts, words, and deeds in alignment with the new state.</p><h3>Shammah &ndash; &ldquo;Hearing&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Desolation&rdquo;)</h3><p>Shammah&rsquo;s defense of the lentil field symbolises the persistence required by the law of assumption. When outer circumstances challenge your assumption, you must defend your inner hearing&mdash;holding your imagined state steady until it externalises. Persistence in assumption is the key to overcoming appearances.</p><hr/><h2>Jesus&rsquo; Call: &ldquo;Let Him Who Has Ears to Hear, Hear&rdquo;</h2><p>When <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> says, &ldquo;Let him who has ears, let him hear,&rdquo; He refers not to physical hearing but to the imaginative faculty that receives the creative Word. Neville interprets this as a direct invitation: accept and persist in the assumption that you already are the new state. Hearing here is pure agreement in imagination&mdash;the conscious choice to assume the unseen as true.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Faith comes by hearing,&rdquo; writes Paul (Romans 10:17).<br/>
In Neville&rsquo;s vocabulary, faith is simply the assured assumption born from inner hearing.</p>
</blockquote><p>Jesus uses <strong>&ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear&rdquo;</strong> multiple times across the Gospels, underscoring the importance of spiritual discernment and the active reception of His teachings.</p><h3>Instances in the Gospels</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew 11:15</strong> &ndash; After denouncing unrepentant cities, Jesus declares, &ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew 13:9</strong> &ndash; Following the Parable of the Sower, He emphasises the need to understand the message: &ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew 13:43</strong> &ndash; In explaining the Parable of the Weeds: &ldquo;Then the righteous will shine like the sun&hellip; He who has ears, let him hear.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mark 4:9</strong>, <strong>4:23</strong>, <strong>7:16</strong> &ndash; In each context&mdash;teaching parables or addressing the crowd&mdash;Jesus repeats, &ldquo;If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Luke 8:8</strong> &ndash; After the Parable of the Sower, He calls again, &ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Luke 14:35</strong> &ndash; Concluding a teaching on discipleship&rsquo;s cost: &ldquo;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In total, this phrase appears <strong>eight times</strong> in the Gospels, highlighting its central role in Jesus&rsquo; ministry. A parallel refrain in Revelation addresses the seven churches: &ldquo;Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches&rdquo; (Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22).</p><hr/><h2>Women in the Old Testament: &ldquo;My Lord Has Heard Me&rdquo;</h2><p>Women of Scripture also demonstrate stages of assumption through their declarations of having been heard:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hannah (&ldquo;The Lord Has Heard&rdquo;)</strong>: In 1 Samuel 1:20, her answered prayer reflects her assumption, in imagination, that she already has her son.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rachel (&ldquo;God Has Heard Me&rdquo;)</strong>: By naming Dan, she assumes the state of motherhood and aligns her imagination with that reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sarah (&ldquo;God Has Made Laughter&rdquo;)</strong>: Her laughter signals the realisation of her assumption; inwardly hearing God&rsquo;s promise produces joy.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These accounts reinforce that hearing in imagination transcends gender: every inner declaration shapes outer reality once assumed and persisted in.</p><hr/><h2>The Thread Deepens the Symbolism of Manifestation</h2><p>Tracing these names in biblical order reveals the gradual deepening of the law of assumption:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Samuel</strong> &ndash; First assumption in stillness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simeon / Simon</strong> &ndash; Recognition and faith formed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shimei</strong> &ndash; Warning: negative assumption also works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peter</strong> &ndash; Fixing the assumption as bedrock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ishmael</strong> &ndash; Inner desire heard, unconsciously assumed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shemaiah</strong> &ndash; Applying assumption in action</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shammah</strong> &ndash; Persisting against doubt</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Woven through it all is Jesus&rsquo; call: those with imaginative &ldquo;ears&rdquo; must hear&mdash;that is, assume&mdash;the unseen state and hold it until it materialises.</p><hr/><h3>Conclusion: Hearing as the Gateway to Creation</h3><p>In Neville Goddard&rsquo;s framework, imagination is God, and the law of assumption is the mechanism by which the unseen becomes seen. Hearing is the first movement of that law&mdash;the moment you receive the seed of a new state. Once you hear, assume, and persist, the outer world must eventually conform.</p><p>
</p><p>So when you read, &ldquo;Let him who has ears to hear, let him hear,&rdquo; take it as a personal instruction: listen inwardly, assume your desire fulfilled, and persist until your world reflects the fullness of your imaginative hearing.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
