<h1>Paul: Against Consuming External Idols and Images </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In 1 Corinthians 8, Paul addresses the issue of whether it's acceptable to eat food sacrificed to idols, a question that seems quite foreign to us today. However, when viewed through Neville Goddard’s psychological framework, this chapter offers profound insights about the nature of knowledge, inner authority, and spiritual consideration. Rather than focusing on historical or ritualistic practices, we can interpret this passage as a symbolic representation of how we navigate our inner world, manage our assumptions, and guide our consciousness.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Knowledge Puffs Up, Love Builds Up</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Now about things offered to images of gods: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes men self-sufficient, but love builds up.”</em> (1 Corinthians 8:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Paul speaks of things offered to images of gods, he is highlighting the difference between outer knowledge and inner realisation. According to the Law of Assumption, knowledge alone keeps us <a href="genesis-126-man.html">fixated on appearances</a> — it makes us feel separate, self-important, and reliant on intellectual certainty. But love, as the true creative power, builds up because it is the active assumption of unity and oneness with all life. Love assumes the best, embodies it, and transforms reality from within, whereas knowledge without love remains an empty form.</p><p>In Neville’s terms, <strong>knowledge</strong> can symbolise a mental grasp of spiritual law—intellectual <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">mastery of imagination</a>, assumption, and inner creation. However, without <a href="genesis-224-love.html">love (symbolising union, empathy, and true imaginative oneness</a>), such knowledge becomes inflated ego. True manifestation comes from love—living in the end with full identification, not just technical understanding.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The False God: External Power </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“So, about eating things offered to images of gods: we know that an image of a god is of no real value in the world, and that there is no God but one.”</em> (1 Corinthians 8:4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eating” symbolises feeding or nurturing the imagination. The “idol” stands for anything external we mistakenly believe holds power — conditions, opinions, or circumstances. Neville reminds us there is no <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> but your own wonderful human imagination. Idols are nothing—they are only projections of past assumptions. To eat food sacrificed to idols is to consume (accept) a reality formed by belief in external powers.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The One God Within</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But for us there is one God, the Father, from whom all things come, and we in him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom all things are made, and we by him.”</em> (1 Corinthians 8:6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="genesis-111-seed.html">Everything in your world is generated from <strong>within</strong></a>. As Neville states, the Father is your imagination. All things are made by your assumption and sustained by your continued identification with them. Paul reaffirms that there is one creative source: your own consciousness.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Not All Have This Knowledge</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But this knowledge is not in all men; and some, with the thought of the image of a god before them, eat it as if it were food offered to an image of a god, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.”</em> (1 Corinthians 8:7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not everyone has awakened to the truth that <strong>imagination creates reality</strong>. Many still live by appearances, believing idols (outer powers) are real. These are the “weaker brethren” in the psychological sense—those states within us that haven’t yet accepted full imaginative control.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Conscience and Inner Conflict</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But food will not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do. But take care that this power of yours does not become a cause of stumbling to the weak.”</em> (1 Corinthians 8:8-9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your liberty—your awakened power to create through imagination—must be handled with care. If you live by truth but flaunt it carelessly, you may cause inner conflict in parts of you still influenced by fear or doubt. Neville teaches that inner states must be lovingly guided; you cannot force the subconscious to accept a new belief—it must be gently led.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Destroy Not the Brother for Whom Christ Died</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And through your knowledge the weak brother is destroyed, the one for whom Christ died.”</em> (1 Corinthians 8:11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Christ” symbolises your <strong>imaginative power</strong> nailed to old beliefs. Don’t use your understanding to shame or crush undeveloped beliefs. In Neville’s terms, you must transform all states with grace, not condemnation. Every “brother” is a state within you, waiting for redemption.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Spiritual Sensitivity</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“So if food is a cause of my brother's falling, I will never again take food, that I may not be a cause of falling to my brother.”</em> (1 Corinthians 8:13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If expressing a certain assumption causes inner conflict or doubt, better to refrain until you’re in full alignment. Spiritual maturity means knowing when to speak a new belief aloud, and when to keep it inward until it is fully accepted by all levels of consciousness.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
1 Corinthians 8 teaches us that <strong>spiritual knowledge without imaginative compassion can cause harm</strong>, both to others and to unredeemed states within ourselves. Neville’s teachings encourage us to honour our liberty in consciousness—but also to walk with wisdom and care. You are not just managing thoughts—you are guiding an entire inner world into unity with the God within.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-bible-verse-analysis.html" class="noTag">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-paul-series.html" class="noTag">Paul Series</a></p>
