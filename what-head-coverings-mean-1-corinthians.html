<h1>Paul: Head Coverings in the Bible</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The passage in 1 Corinthians 11 is often reduced to debates about headscarves, veils and gender roles — but when read symbolically, as Neville Goddard taught, it reveals something far deeper. This isn’t a lesson in outward modesty; it’s a coded map of how the conscious and subconscious work together under the Law of Assumption. Each line <a href="elohim-god.html">speaks to the structure of your inner world</a> — awareness, imagination, assumption, and manifestation — and how these forces interact to bring your reality into being.</p><p>This symbolic structure is first defined in <b>Genesis 1:27</b>:</p><blockquote><p><i>"So God made man in his image, in the image of God he made him: male and female he made them."</i></p></blockquote>
<p>In Neville’s framework, “male and female” are not physical genders, but psychological polarities — conscious and subconscious, both present in every individual. The conscious (male) is the chooser; the subconscious (female) is the acceptor and bringer forth. <b>1 Corinthians 11</b> reaffirms this ancient pattern, reminding us that manifestation depends on the right relationship between assumption and feeling — between the idea you hold and the power that brings it to life.</p><p>
This relationship is further clarified in <b>Genesis 2:23</b>:</p><p>
</p><blockquote><p><i>"And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."</i></p></blockquote><p>
This is not a literal biological statement — it is the symbolic recognition that the <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">subconscious emerges from the conscious</a>. “Bone of my bones” means she is of the same substance — but expressed differently. In Neville’s terms, Woman (subconscious) is drawn from the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">inner structure of Man</a> (conscious), shaped by his assumptions. She reflects and fulfils what he inwardly declares to be true. The creative power — manifestation — begins when the conscious mind names (assumes), and the subconscious accepts and gives it form.</p><blockquote>"So take me for your example, even as I take Christ for mine." —1 Corinthians 11:1</blockquote>
Paul begins by affirming the <strong>chain of assumption</strong>. He follows the Christ — symbolic of imagination — and urges others to follow him. This reflects Neville’s idea that <strong>everything follows the structure of consciousness</strong>: God (<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>) → Christ <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">(Imagination)</a> → Man (<a href="genesis-126-man.html">Conscious Mind</a>) → Woman <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">(Subconscious)</a>.<p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"Now I am pleased to keep you in mind at all times, and to have your approval in the keeping of the rules which I gave you." — 1 Corinthians 11:2</strong></blockquote>"Now I am pleased to keep you in mind that all times" is, as usual, a coded nod towards holding the assumption in mind at all times in a wonderful way. This isn’t about dogma, but inner discipline — the "rules" are the principles of <strong>creative consciousness</strong>. The mind must <strong>maintain order</strong> between conscious assumption and subconscious receptivity.<p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"But I would have you see that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God." — 1 Corinthians 11:3</strong></blockquote>
The hierarchy of consciousness:<p></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">God = I AM</a> (Awareness)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ = Imagination</a> (Creative Power)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="genesis-126-man.html">Man = Conscious Mind</a></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Woman = Subconscious Mind</a></strong><br/>
Each part flows from and depends on the other. Manifestation requires proper alignment of these inner roles.</p>
</li>
</ul><div>The fact that Paul draws attention to the <i>head</i> is significant symbolism.</div><hr/><blockquote><strong>"Every man who takes part in prayer, or gives teaching as a prophet, with his head covered, puts shame on his head." — 1 Corinthians 11:4</strong></blockquote>
If your <strong>conscious mind</strong> is clouded — full of borrowed beliefs or doubts — you shame your own creative authority. The conscious must be <strong>clear and decisive</strong>, uncovering itself to higher truth.<p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"But every woman who takes part in prayer, or gives teaching as a prophet, without covering her head, puts shame on her head; for it is the same as if her head were cut off." — 1 Corinthians 11:5</strong></blockquote>
The <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, if left open and uncovered, is vulnerable. Without protection (mental discipline), it accepts <strong>random impressions</strong>, leading to chaotic or unwanted results.<p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"For if a woman is without a cover, let her hair be cut off. But if it is a shame for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be made bald, let her be covered." — 1 Corinthians 11:6</strong></blockquote>
The subconscious must either be <strong>completely shut off (bald)</strong> — or <strong>guarded and selective (covered)</strong>. The latter is preferred. You must consciously choose what gets impressed on it.<p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"For it is not right for a man to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man." — 1 Corinthians 11:7</strong></blockquote>
The conscious mind (man) reflects <strong>God’s image — the power to choose and assume</strong>. The subconscious (woman) <strong>reflects the man’s assumptions</strong>, and her glory is in <strong>what she brings forth from them</strong>.<p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"For the man did not come from the woman, but the woman from the man. And the man was not made for the woman, but the woman for the man." — 1 Corinthians 11:8–9</strong></blockquote>
The subconscious (woman) originates from the conscious (man) and is <strong>designed to serve</strong> his assumption. She does not <strong>direct</strong>, but <strong>responds</strong> and <strong>manifests</strong> what he impresses upon her.<p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"For this reason it is right for the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels." — 1 Corinthians 11:10</strong></blockquote>
The subconscious must wear a <strong>symbolic veil</strong> — meaning it should be governed by the conscious assumption. “Angels” symbolise <strong>imaginal acts and feelings</strong> — messengers that move creation.<br/>
<strong>Guard the subconscious, because assumptions carry power.</strong><p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"But the woman is not separate from the man, and the man is not separate from the woman in the Lord. For as the woman came from the man, so the man comes through the woman; but all things come from God." — 1 Corinthians 11:11–12</strong></blockquote>
Conscious and subconscious are <strong>interdependent</strong>. One gives, one receives, but both are needed for manifestation. And both originate from <strong>God — the I AM</strong> that underlies all.<p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"Be judges yourselves of the question: does it seem right for a woman to take part in prayer unveiled before God?" — 1 Corinthians 11:13</strong></blockquote>
Should the subconscious be left open to the world? No. It should only receive what has been <strong>consciously and reverently chosen</strong>. This is the Law of Assumption in action.<p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"Does it not seem natural to you that if a man has long hair, it is a cause of shame to him? But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given to her for a covering." — 1 Corinthians 11:14–15</strong></blockquote>
Long hair = natural <strong>receptivity and protection</strong>. The subconscious thrives in secrecy and reflection. But if the conscious mind (man) becomes passive like the subconscious, <strong>he loses his authority to assume</strong>.<p></p><hr/><blockquote><strong>"But if any man seems to be given to argument, let him know that we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God." — 1 Corinthians 11:16</strong></blockquote><br/>
There’s no point in arguing with this <strong>inner order</strong>. It is universal. Just as Neville said: <strong>“Feeling is the secret.”</strong> The structure of creation does not change — only your awareness of it does.<p></p><hr/><h2>Final Summary</h2>
<p>1 Corinthians 11:1–16 isn’t about outward dress codes — it’s <strong>an inner psychology lesson</strong>.<br/>
The <strong>conscious mind (man)</strong> must lead with clear assumptions.<br/>
The <strong>subconscious mind (woman)</strong> must be veiled — protected from stray impressions.<br/>
This inner hierarchy — God &gt; Christ &gt; Man &gt; Woman — is not repressive but <strong>creative</strong>.<br/>
Through <strong>assumption</strong>, you unite the conscious and subconscious in belief — and that is what gives birth to reality.</p>
