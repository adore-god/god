    <h1>How the Psalms Elevate Consciousness</h1>
    <p>To many, the Book of Psalms is a beloved collection of sacred poetry—prayers and praises that reflect the full spectrum of human emotion. But through the spiritual understanding of Neville Goddard, the Psalms offer something even more transformative: a <strong>map of consciousness</strong>, designed to elevate awareness and activate the creative power within.</p>
<p>Neville taught that the Bible is not a record of secular history, but rather <strong>a psychological drama playing out within each individual</strong>. The characters, events, and verses symbolise <em>states of consciousness</em>, not external happenings. Seen from this perspective, the Psalms become more than poetic prayers—they are <strong>living tools</strong>, designed to <strong>guide your inner conversation</strong> and lift you into higher states of being.</p>
<h3>The Psalms as Aspirational States</h3>
<p>Each Psalm portrays an inner condition: sorrow, trust, fear, joy, hope, gratitude, and triumph. Neville would describe these not simply as emotions, but as <strong>spiritual states that one can enter and dwell in deliberately</strong>. The Psalms serve as prompts—helping the soul feel its way into the reality it wishes to experience.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.”</em><br/>
—Psalm 23:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Neville’s view, “The Lord” refers not to an external deity, but to <strong>your own wonderful human imagination</strong>—your I AM. This verse is a statement of inner conviction: your consciousness, once aligned with your desire, leads you to its fulfilment. It is <strong>a declaration of wholeness and security</strong>, an invitation to live from the end.</p>
<h3>Feeling Is the Secret</h3>
<p>A cornerstone of Neville’s teaching is the idea that <strong>“feeling is the secret.”</strong> Whatever you persistently feel to be true—whether desired or not—becomes your reality. The Psalms, when read with genuine feeling and identification, become <strong>acts of creation</strong> rather than simple recitations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.”</em><br/>
—Psalm 37:4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To Neville, this means: find joy in your awareness of being—your I AM—and let that joy align with the feeling of the wish fulfilled. When your inner state matches your desire, your external world must conform to it.</p>
<h3>A Manual for Inner Renewal</h3>
<p>Throughout the Psalms are affirmations and declarations of faith that can be used to <strong>reprogramme the subconscious mind</strong>—which Neville regarded as the creative power behind all manifestation. Each verse is a <strong>seed planted in consciousness</strong>, intended to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Consider this powerful verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.”</em><br/>
—Psalm 51:10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville would interpret this as an inner shift—not a plea to an outside force, but a conscious move into a new identity. The “clean heart” represents a purified imagination—free from fear, resentment, or limitation.</p>
<h3>Moving Between States of Being</h3>
<p>Neville taught that life is a continuous journey through various states of consciousness. You are never stuck—you are simply in a state that can be left for another by changing how you feel and what you accept as true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.”</em><br/>
—Psalm 121:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not about looking upward physically, but rather <strong>lifting your mental gaze</strong>—choosing to dwell in higher truths and loftier visions. The Psalms encourage you to live from faith, not fear—from fulfilment, not lack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Be still, and know that I am God.”</em><br/>
—Psalm 46:10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse captures Neville’s central message: that <strong>your I AMness is God</strong>. In stillness, in deep awareness of being, you access the creative power. It is here that you assume the feeling of the desired state—and what you feel to be true inwardly, becomes your outer reality.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Through Neville Goddard’s understanding, the Psalms are not just ancient poetry, but <strong>blueprints for conscious creation</strong>. They show you how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speak from conviction, not complaint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume the desire is already fulfilled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abide in elevated emotional states</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use imagination as the key to transformation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Psalms are not passive prayers—they are <strong>powerful mental postures</strong> that reshape your self-concept and attune your mind to the truth: that <strong>you are one with God, and imagination is the gateway to all things</strong>.</p>
<p>So the next time you read a Psalm, don’t see it as a relic of the past. See it as <strong>your own soul speaking to itself</strong>—offering direction, power, and peace. Enter the feeling of the words. Assume them as true. In doing so, you’re not merely reading scripture…</p>
<p><strong>You’re creating reality.</strong></p>
