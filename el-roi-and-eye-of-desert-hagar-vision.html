<h1>Sarah and Hagar: The Well</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Genesis 16 is often read as a story of impatience, jealousy, and divine intervention. But through Neville Goddard’s framework—where every biblical character and setting symbolises states of consciousness—it becomes a deeply personal parable about what happens when we <strong>abandon the inner life of assumption</strong> and try to manifest through <strong>outer effort</strong> instead.</p><p>This isn’t just the story of Sarai, Abram, and Hagar. It’s the story of any person who, in doubt or desperation, reaches for a shortcut and finds themselves lost—only to discover that even exile becomes sacred when the <strong>eye of God</strong> is found within.</p><hr><h3><strong>Characters as States of Consciousness</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Abram</strong> symbolises the <strong>creative power of imagination</strong>, the fathering principle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sarai</strong>, his wife, represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>—receptive and impressionable, but in this case, barren and impatient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hagar</strong>, the Egyptian handmaid, stands for <strong>the outer method</strong>, a reliance on effort rather than assumption. She is a symbol of <strong>manifestation through works</strong> rather than inner alignment.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>“And Sarai said unto Abram… go in, I pray thee, unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her.”</em><br>
<em>(Genesis 16:2)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sarai, like many of us when faith falters, pushes imagination (Abram) to act through external means. Instead of trusting in the promise, she attempts to manufacture it—bypassing the divine creative flow.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Consequences of Forcing Manifestation</strong></h3><p>When Hagar conceives, tension erupts. The result—<strong>Ishmael</strong>—symbolises a manifestation <strong>not born of inner vision</strong>, but from <strong>fear and impatience</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p>Neville often warned against “straining” to manifest, teaching instead that true creation must feel natural and come from <strong>assuming the state</strong> of the wish fulfilled. Hagar is fruitful, but her son is not the child of the promise.</p>
</blockquote><p>Though Sarai’s harshness sparks the crisis, it is Abraham who sends Hagar away—an act that symbolises the decision to release old, external ways of thinking. </p><p>In Genesis 21:9-14 Sarah saw Hagar’s son mocking and told Abraham to send Hagar and her son away, saying the son of the bondwoman must not share the inheritance with Isaac. Though distressed, Abraham obeyed God’s command, giving Hagar bread and water and sending her into the wilderness of Beersheba, where she wandered until the water ran out.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Angel of the Lord: The Voice of Inner Realignment</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.”</em><br>
<em>(Genesis 16:7)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville did not interpret angels as winged messengers from above, but as <strong>personifications of eternal attributes</strong>—impulses or insights that <strong>arise within</strong> to reorient our consciousness.</p><p>The “angel of the Lord” represents a <strong>movement of inner truth</strong>, an awakening message from the divine self. It appears at the lowest point—when Hagar is alone, frightened, and resigned—calling her to <strong>re-examine her direction</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go?”</em><br>
<em>(Genesis 16:8)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This question is not geographical—it is <strong>psychological</strong>. It prompts a return to awareness: <em>Where did this state come from? Where are you letting it take you?</em></p><p>The angel continues:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.”</em><br>
<em>(Genesis 16:9)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In symbolic terms, this is a call to <strong>reunite with the subconscious (Sarai)</strong>—to bring the outer activity (Hagar) back into alignment with the inner creative law. Assumption must not be separated from <strong>faithful imagination</strong>. Return, not to Sarai as a person, but to the <strong>source of true conception</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p>Even manifestations born from error (Ishmael) are not cursed. The angel declares:</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><em>“I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.”</em><br>
<em>(Genesis 16:10)</em></p>
</blockquote><hr><h3><strong>The Eye in the Desert: El Roi and the Rediscovery of Living Water</strong></h3><p>This sacred encounter culminates in a stunning recognition:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me.”</em><br>
<em>(Genesis 16:13)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is followed by:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.”</em><br>
<em>(Genesis 16:14)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Beer-lahai-roi</strong> means <em>“The well of the Living One who sees me.”</em> It is here, beside <strong>living water</strong>, that Hagar comes into contact not just with God—but with a God <strong>who sees</strong> her. </p><p>This living water is more than refreshment—it is restoration. In the symbology of Genesis, <strong>living water first flows from Eden</strong>, the garden whose very name means <em>pleasure</em> or <em>delight</em>. From this centre of divine consciousness, a single river parts and becomes four: <strong>Pishon</strong>, <strong>Gihon</strong>, <strong>Hiddekel</strong> (Tigris), and <strong>Euphrates</strong>—each name evoking <strong>abundance, overflow, and increase</strong>.</p><p>Just as Eden’s river becomes many, so the singular awareness of "I AM" becomes the source of <strong>every outpictured blessing</strong> in your world. The well in the wilderness is not separate from Eden—it is a <em>forgotten branch</em> rediscovered when awareness returns. Hagar, in recognising “El Roi,” touches the original flow of life itself.</p><blockquote>
<p>To remember that you are seen is to remember that <strong>you are not separate</strong> from the Source that sees.<br>
The eye of God, and the water of Eden, are not above you—they are <strong>within</strong> you.</p>
</blockquote><hr><h3><strong>Between Kadesh and Bered: A Liminal Space</strong></h3><p>The well’s location—between <em>Kadesh</em> (“holy”) and <em>Bered</em> (“scattered” or “hail”)—marks a <strong>spiritual threshold</strong>. It is the place where the fragmented mind meets the sacred. This is where we often find our own revelation: in the in-between.</p><blockquote>
<p>In Neville’s language, this is the space where you shift from separation to identification. From being cast out… to recognising that <em>you are the source</em>.</p>
</blockquote><hr><h3><strong>Conclusion: Even Your Missteps Are Seen</strong></h3><p>Genesis 16 reminds us that even when we’ve misapplied the law of imagination—even when we’ve taken action from fear or force—the <strong>God within</strong> has not departed.</p><p>The <strong>angel of the Lord</strong>—that movement of divine inner correction—will meet us at our lowest and speak clarity into confusion. It will return us to the well of living water, where the awareness that "I AM" is restored.</p><p>The wilderness does not lack a river—it only needs to be remembered.<br>
Even there, <strong>Beer-lahai-roi</strong> flows.<br>
Even there, <strong>you are seen</strong>.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
