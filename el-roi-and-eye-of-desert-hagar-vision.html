<h1>Sarah and Hagar: The Well</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Genesis 16 is often read as a story of impatience, jealousy, and divine intervention. But through Neville Goddard&rsquo;s framework&mdash;where every biblical character and setting symbolises states of consciousness&mdash;it becomes a deeply personal parable about what happens when we <strong>abandon the inner life of assumption</strong> and try to manifest through <strong>outer effort</strong> instead.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t just the story of Sarai, Abram, and Hagar. It&rsquo;s the story of any person who, in doubt or desperation, reaches for a shortcut and finds themselves lost&mdash;only to discover that even exile becomes sacred when the <strong>eye of God</strong> is found within.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Characters as States of Consciousness</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Abram</strong> symbolises the <strong>creative power of imagination</strong>, the fathering principle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sarai</strong>, his wife, represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>&mdash;receptive and impressionable, but in this case, barren and impatient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hagar</strong>, the Egyptian handmaid or slave, stands for <strong>the outer method</strong>, a reliance on effort rather than assumption. She is a symbol of <strong>manifestation through works</strong> rather than inner alignment.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And Sarai said unto Abram&hellip; go in, I pray thee, unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Genesis 16:2)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sarai, like many of us when faith falters, pushes imagination (Abram) to act through external means. Instead of trusting in the promise, she attempts to manufacture it&mdash;bypassing the divine creative flow.</p><hr/><h3><strong>The Consequences of Forcing Manifestation</strong></h3><p>When Hagar conceives, tension erupts. The result&mdash;<strong>Ishmael</strong>&mdash;symbolises a manifestation <strong>not born of inner vision</strong>, but from <strong>fear and impatience</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p>Neville often warned against &ldquo;straining&rdquo; to manifest, teaching instead that true creation must feel natural and come from <strong>assuming the state</strong> of the wish fulfilled. Hagar is fruitful, but her son is not the child of the promise.</p>
</blockquote><p>Though Sarai&rsquo;s harshness sparks the crisis, it is Abraham who sends Hagar away&mdash;an act that symbolises the decision to release old, external ways of thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>In Genesis 21:9-14 Sarah saw Hagar&rsquo;s son mocking and told Abraham to send Hagar and her son away, saying the son of the bondwoman must not share the inheritance with Isaac. Though distressed, Abraham obeyed God&rsquo;s command, giving Hagar bread and water and sending her into the wilderness of Beersheba, where she wandered until the water ran out.</p><hr/><h3><strong>The Angel of the Lord: The Voice of Inner Realignment</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Genesis 16:7)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville did not interpret angels as winged messengers from above, but as <strong>personifications of eternal attributes</strong>&mdash;impulses or insights that <strong>arise within</strong> to reorient our consciousness.</p><p>The &ldquo;angel of the Lord&rdquo; represents a <strong>movement of inner truth</strong>, an awakening message from the divine self. It appears at the lowest point&mdash;when Hagar is alone, frightened, and resigned&mdash;calling her to <strong>re-examine her direction</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go?&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Genesis 16:8)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This question is not geographical&mdash;it is <strong>psychological</strong>. It prompts a return to awareness: <em>Where did this state come from? Where are you letting it take you?</em></p><p>The angel continues:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Genesis 16:9)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In symbolic terms, this is a call to <strong>reunite with the subconscious (Sarai)</strong>&mdash;to bring the outer activity (Hagar) back into alignment with the inner creative law. Assumption must not be separated from <strong>faithful imagination</strong>. Return, not to Sarai as a person, but to the <strong>source of true conception</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p>Even manifestations born from error (Ishmael) are not cursed. The angel declares:</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Genesis 16:10)</em></p>
</blockquote><hr/><h3><strong>The Eye in the Desert: El Roi and the Rediscovery of Living Water</strong></h3><p>This sacred encounter culminates in a stunning recognition:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Genesis 16:13)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is followed by:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.&rdquo;</em><br/>
<em>(Genesis 16:14)</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Beer-lahai-roi</strong> means <em>&ldquo;The well of the Living One who sees me.&rdquo;</em> It is here, beside <strong>living water</strong>, that Hagar comes into contact not just with God&mdash;but with a God <strong>who sees</strong> her.&nbsp;</p><p>This living water is more than refreshment&mdash;it is restoration. In the symbology of Genesis, <strong>living water first flows from Eden</strong>, the garden whose very name means <em>pleasure</em> or <em>delight</em>. From this centre of divine consciousness, a single river parts and becomes four: <strong>Pishon</strong>, <strong>Gihon</strong>, <strong>Hiddekel</strong> (Tigris), and <strong>Euphrates</strong>&mdash;each name evoking <strong>abundance, overflow, and increase</strong>.</p><p>Just as Eden&rsquo;s river becomes many, so the singular awareness of "I AM" becomes the source of <strong>every outpictured blessing</strong> in your world. The well in the wilderness is not separate from Eden&mdash;it is a <em>forgotten branch</em> rediscovered when awareness returns. Hagar, in recognising &ldquo;El Roi,&rdquo; touches the original flow of life itself.</p><blockquote>
<p>To remember that you are seen is to remember that <strong>you are not separate</strong> from the Source that sees.<br/>
The eye of God, and the water of Eden, are not above you&mdash;they are <strong>within</strong> you.</p>
</blockquote><hr/><h3><strong>Between Kadesh and Bered: A Liminal Space</strong></h3><p>The well&rsquo;s location&mdash;between <em>Kadesh</em> (&ldquo;holy&rdquo;) and <em>Bered</em> (&ldquo;scattered&rdquo; or &ldquo;hail&rdquo;)&mdash;marks a <strong>spiritual threshold</strong>. It is the place where the fragmented mind meets the sacred. This is where we often find our own revelation: in the in-between.</p><blockquote>
<p>In Neville&rsquo;s language, this is the space where you shift from separation to identification. From being cast out&hellip; to recognising that <em>you are the source</em>.</p>
</blockquote><hr/><h3><strong>Conclusion: Even Your Missteps Are Seen</strong></h3><p>Genesis 16 reminds us that even when we&rsquo;ve misapplied the law of imagination&mdash;even when we&rsquo;ve taken action from fear or force&mdash;the <strong>God within</strong> has not departed.</p><p>The <strong>angel of the Lord</strong>&mdash;that movement of divine inner correction&mdash;will meet us at our lowest and speak clarity into confusion. It will return us to the well of living water, where the awareness that "I AM" is restored.</p><p>The wilderness does not lack a river&mdash;it only needs to be remembered.<br/>
Even there, <strong>Beer-lahai-roi</strong> flows.<br/>
Even there, <strong>you are seen</strong>.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
