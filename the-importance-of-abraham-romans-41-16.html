<h1>Paul: Abraham's Faith — Romans 4:1-16 </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Romans 4:1-16 is a psychological revelation for anyone willing to explore the imagining mind. Through Neville Goddard’s framework—particularly the Law of Assumption—Paul’s words take on a new life. <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a> is not a distant patriarch, but a symbol of the one who dares to <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume a new state of being</a>. This chapter reveals that transformation doesn’t come through outward effort or moral law, but through inner conviction—through <a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagining</a> and living from the end. It is faith, not works, that brings the promise to life.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Romans 4:1–3</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What then shall we say that Abraham our father has found according to the flesh? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a> represents the <strong>state of faith</strong>—the individual who, despite no physical evidence, assumes the state desired. He imagines and persists in that assumption. His "belief" is not passive; it is the <strong>act of inner conviction</strong>, the assumption that he already is what he desires to be. Justification doesn’t come from works (outer effort), but from the inner movement—<strong>the assumption made in faith</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Romans 4:4–5</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt. But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness…</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br>
This emphasises that <strong>outer works—striving, effort, and morality—are not what produce transformation.</strong> It is the act of assuming, of believing in the unseen, that is counted as “righteous.” Neville would point out that righteousness means “right thinking” or “alignment with the divine assumption.” The “<i>ungodly</i>” being justified means consciously readjusting aspects of mind that are not in alignment with the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Romans 4:6–8</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>…“Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; Blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall not impute sin.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br><a href="genesis-47-sin.html">
Sin is simply <strong>“missing the mark”—failing to assume the state you desire</strong></a>. The man (<i>remember the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">bible's definition of man</a></i>) blessed is not condemned for past assumptions, but is free because he now aligns with the truth: <strong>“<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” is God.</strong> When one takes on a new assumption, the past is not counted against him—the old man is buried, and the new man is born.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Romans 4:9–12</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Does this blessedness then come upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also?...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br>
Paul is saying the <strong>blessing (transformation) is not exclusive to a religious ritual or tradition</strong>. Circumcision here symbolises outward signs of religious identity. Neville would say: the <strong>Law of Assumption works for anyone</strong> who applies it. Abraham assumed fatherhood while still “uncircumcised,” meaning before he did anything external—before he could point to anything in the visible world to prove it. This is the essence of manifestation.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Romans 4:13–15</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith…</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br><a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">The “promise”</a> is the <strong>inheritance of the fulfilled desire</strong>—to become what you imagine. It is not earned through adherence to laws or external standards, but through <strong>imaginative faith</strong>. Abraham is called the heir of the world because he dared to believe, to assume the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">wish fulfilled</a>. Law produces wrath—frustration, limitation. But <strong>faith sets the imagination free</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Romans 4:16</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed…</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville’s interpretation:</strong><br>
The promise comes <strong>through assumption (faith)</strong>, not works. Grace here is the <b>is the <a href="forgiveness-letting-go-of-past-to-free.html">forgiveness</a> one allows themselves to enable them to remain in the ideal state</b>. Anyone—Jew, Gentile, moral, immoral—can manifest if they believe. The law of Assumption is always in action, but usually through a limited perception of self until it is mastered. The <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">“seed” is any <strong>imagined state that is planted and persisted in</strong></a>. That’s the universal law Neville taught: imagine it, feel it real, and persist.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Summary according to Neville:</h3>
<p>Romans 4 is Paul’s metaphysical lesson on <strong>manifestation through faith</strong>—a deep alignment with the assumption of the wish fulfilled. Abraham’s story is not biological or historical; it's psychological. He is the <strong>father of all who dare to believe</strong>. The whole passage confirms Neville’s core message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is not what you do on the outside, but what you assume on the inside, that brings about your world.”</p></blockquote><p class="label-links"><a href="label-abraham-series.html" class="noTag">Abraham Series</a> | <a href="label-paul-series.html" class="noTag">Paul Series</a> | <a href="label-paul-s-letters--romans.html" class="noTag">Paul's Letters: Romans</a></p>
