<h1>The Valley of Dry Bones:  The Creation of Woman and Life</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The Bible, when stripped of literalism, becomes the diary of consciousness&mdash;an intimate charting of the inner man&rsquo;s rise from fragmentation to fullness. Neville Goddard taught that every character, valley, and breath in scripture is symbolic of a spiritual process happening within you.</p><p>Ezekiel 37:1-14, often read as a vision of national restoration, is in truth a vivid allegory of personal resurrection&mdash;the reanimation of a lost or abandoned state of being through the power of imagination. When paired with Genesis 2:23 and Adam's statement regarding the creation of woman&mdash;<em>&ldquo;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh&rdquo;</em>&mdash;we see not two isolated scriptures, but a single unfolding: the act of reclaiming and recognising the manifestation as coming from within oneself.</p><p>This article walks through Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision step by step, aligned with Neville&rsquo;s principle that imagination is the only creative power. The bones are not strangers. They are fragments of you. And when you speak life over them, what returns is not foreign&mdash;but familiar. Flesh of your flesh. The imagined become real.</p><hr/><h3><strong>1. &ldquo;The hand of the Lord was upon me&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; The Initiation of Vision</strong></h3><p>Ezekiel is carried in the spirit to a valley full of bones. Neville would say this isn&rsquo;t a location in space but in consciousness. The &ldquo;hand of the Lord&rdquo; is <strong>awareness being stirred</strong>&mdash;the moment when you are made to face your inner barrenness. The dry bones represent <strong>dead states</strong>, long-forgotten desires, past versions of self that have lost vitality.</p><p>In this valley, you see not an enemy, but the <strong>fragments of self</strong>. Bones are what remain after all else is stripped away&mdash;<strong>the essence of what once was alive in you</strong>.</p><hr/><h3><strong>2. &ldquo;Can these bones live?&rdquo; &ndash; The Divine Challenge to Imagination</strong></h3><p>God asks Ezekiel, <em>&ldquo;Can these bones live?&rdquo;</em> Neville would say this is the eternal question posed to the human imagination. Can the state you&rsquo;ve abandoned&mdash;be it confidence, love, joy, health&mdash;be revived through assumption?</p><p>The prophet doesn&rsquo;t answer definitively; he replies, <em>&ldquo;O Lord God, thou knowest.&rdquo;</em> This isn&rsquo;t doubt, but a handover. It&rsquo;s a recognition that it is <strong>not by effort</strong>, but by alignment with the creative power of consciousness&mdash;by speaking the word, not by analysing the problem.</p><hr/><h3><strong>3. &ldquo;Prophesy upon these bones&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Imagination Takes Command</strong></h3><p>Now the real work begins. Ezekiel is told to <strong>speak to the bones</strong>, to tell them to hear the word of the Lord. Neville always emphasised that <strong>creation begins with an assumption spoken within</strong>. The word isn&rsquo;t just speech&mdash;it is the <em>felt assumption</em> that the state is alive.</p><p>The act of prophesying here is not fortune-telling; it is <strong>commanding life</strong> into a condition that has none. This is the moment when you dare to speak to the thing you&rsquo;ve buried and <strong>assume its return</strong>.</p><hr/><h3><strong>4. &ldquo;Bone came together to his bone&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Inner Structure Returns</strong></h3><p>As the prophet speaks, there&rsquo;s a noise, a shaking&mdash;<strong>movement in consciousness</strong>. Things that seemed scattered and disconnected begin to assemble. This is not yet the full manifestation, but the moment where your inner world <strong>starts to reorient</strong> toward the new identity.</p><p>The phrase <em>&ldquo;bone to his bone&rdquo;</em> echoes <strong>Genesis 2:23</strong>: <em>&ldquo;bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.&rdquo;</em> In Neville&rsquo;s language, this is recognition. You begin to feel the <em>rightness</em> of the state. The image you&rsquo;ve imagined starts to feel familiar, intimate, even though it has not yet appeared in your outer world.</p><hr/><h3><strong>5. &ldquo;But there was no breath in them&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; The Lifelike Yet Lifeless Phase</strong></h3><p>Though the bones are now structured with sinews and flesh, they remain inert. This symbolises the state that has been fully imagined but not yet <strong>felt as real</strong>. Neville often said that many imagine things vividly but fail to <strong>breathe life into them</strong> through belief and emotion.</p><p>This is the danger of living only in visualisation without inhabiting the state emotionally. The body is there&mdash;but <strong>breath</strong>, which Neville equates with the <strong>life-giving intensity of assumption</strong>, has not yet entered.</p><hr/><h3><strong>6. &ldquo;Prophesy unto the wind&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Calling the Breath: Emotional Investment</strong></h3><p>Now Ezekiel is told to call to the breath&mdash;to the <strong>ruach</strong>, the spirit. This is not just imagery; it is Neville&rsquo;s act of <strong>feeling the state inwardly until it is alive</strong>. The breath is <strong>emotional conviction</strong>. It&rsquo;s the power of <em>I AM</em> infused with desire and belief.</p><p>As Neville taught, once you feel the state as real, you&rsquo;ve breathed life into it. You no longer think <em>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo;</em> but <em>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</em> That&rsquo;s when the state <strong>stands on its feet</strong>.</p><hr/><h3><strong>7. &ldquo;An exceeding great army&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; The Embodied Identity Emerges</strong></h3><p>The bones become a vast army&mdash;no longer fragments, but <strong>an empowered collective identity</strong>. The state is no longer a vague dream or private hope; it is something you <strong>stand in</strong>, walk in, and carry in your awareness.</p><p>This is the resurrection of a new version of you. Not simply a return to life, but an <strong>elevated, unified state</strong>&mdash;strengthened by the very death it overcame.</p><hr/><h3><strong>8. &ldquo;These bones are the whole house of Israel&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; The Spiritual Realisation</strong></h3><p>Finally, God says: <em>&ldquo;These bones are the whole house of Israel&hellip; they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost.&rdquo;</em> This is the mindset many live in&mdash;thinking the state is too far gone, the desire too unrealistic.</p><p>But God responds: <em>&ldquo;I will put my spirit in you, and ye shall live.&rdquo;</em> Neville saw &ldquo;Israel&rdquo; as a symbol of <strong>spiritual awakening</strong>&mdash;the process by which man discovers himself to be God-in-man, the creator of his reality.</p><hr/><h3><strong>9. The Genesis 2:23 Moment &ndash; Recognition of the Created as Self</strong></h3><p>Once the bones are alive and standing, Ezekiel does not shrink back in awe of some foreign miracle. Just as Adam looks at Eve and says <em>&ldquo;This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,&rdquo;</em> so does the imaginer look at the manifestation and recognise it as <strong>an emanation of their own assumption</strong>.</p><p>It is <em>yours</em> not because you earned it or attracted it, but because <strong>you were its source</strong>. It was taken from you, formed through you, and is now returned to walk beside you as part of your world.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Return of the Recognisable State</strong></h3><p>Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision is not a prophecy for a future nation&mdash;it is a roadmap for how a person <strong>resurrects their inner world</strong>. And Genesis 2:23 gives the emotional punctuation: the moment you see your world and say, <em>&ldquo;This is mine. This is me. This came from within.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Neville Goddard taught that you are both the prophet and the Adam. You imagine. You assume. You prophesy. And then you behold your creation&mdash;not as a miracle from above, but as <strong>bone of your bones and flesh of your flesh</strong>.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
