<h1>Paul's Marriage Allegory: Summary </h1>
<p></p>
<p>Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 7 are often misunderstood as instructions about physical marriage and relationships. But Neville Goddard shows us that Paul is speaking allegorically—using the language of marriage to teach a spiritual law: the law of Assumption. This law is about <a href="genesis-224-love.html">cleaving, or firmly attaching, yourself to what you love and want to embody</a>. It’s the same principle that Genesis hints at when it speaks of the union between <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> and <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">wife</a>—a symbol of the inner union between your conscious mind and your imagined state.</p>
<p>When Paul talks about the wife, he’s not just talking about a person—he’s describing the inner reality of holding fast to your chosen state with faith and love. This chapter is a coded guide to how imagination works: how you stay connected, disciplined, and faithful to your assumption until it manifests.</p>
<p>Below is a symbolic retelling of 1 Corinthians 7 that cuts through the surface and maps the inner process of manifestation and the creative power of disciplined imagination.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Assumption as Union</strong></p><p>
Marriage represents a union between belief and feeling. To “marry” a state is to assume it as true, and that union will produce visible results in your world.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Discipline of Remaining “Unmarried”</strong><br/>
Remaining unmarried symbolises staying detached and open—disciplined enough not to rush into union with a state you don’t truly desire or aren’t ready to commit to.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Danger of Scattered Focus</strong><br/>
Sexual immorality represents the mind’s promiscuity—dabbling in too many conflicting assumptions, weakening manifestation. Paul advises choosing one “wife” (state) and sticking to it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Withdrawal and Prayer</strong><br/>
Temporary abstinence reflects taking time out from active assumption to realign your vision (prayer) and purify your imaginative focus (fasting).</p>
<p><strong>5. The Power of Inner Agreement</strong><br/>
A divided mind (symbolised by separation or unbelief between husband and wife) leads to unrest. A state must be fully accepted and harmonised for manifestation to occur.</p>
<p><strong>6. Each State Has Its Season</strong><br/>
Paul insists that each remain in the condition in which they were called. In Neville’s terms, each assumption has a purpose and timing; rest in it until it completes its work.</p>
<p><strong>7. Virginity as Creative Potential</strong><br/>
The “virgin” symbolises a state of untouched potential. Marriage is not morally better—choosing not to assume a state can be powerful if it preserves your energy for the right desire.</p>
<p><strong>8. Letting Go Without Force</strong><br/>
If a state no longer serves you or “leaves,” let it go without striving. Consciousness is not chained to any one belief; it must remain free to evolve.</p>
<p><strong>9. The Unbelieving Made Holy</strong><br/>
Persisting in an assumption can eventually sanctify even the subconscious parts of us that first resisted it. Faith transforms inner unbelief.</p>
<p><strong>10. The Present Distress</strong><br/>
Paul cautions against new commitments during times of trouble. Spiritually, this means don’t force a new assumption in the midst of emotional turmoil. Wait until you’re clear.</p>
<p><strong>11. The Passing World</strong><br/>
The world is transient—your assumptions shape and reshape it constantly. Marriage, mourning, joy, and possessions are all temporary reflections of your inner state.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>
1 Corinthians 7, when re-read through the symbolism Neville Goddard revealed, becomes a chapter about the sacred power of assumption. To remain unmarried is to preserve creative potential; to marry is to consciously commit to a belief. Paul is not prescribing a lifestyle, but describing spiritual mechanics—how inner union (assumption) leads to outer birth (manifestation). The chapter invites us to enter spiritual union deliberately, faithfully, and with clarity.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-genesis-2-24-series.html">Genesis 2:24 Series</a> | <a href="label-marriage-series.html">Marriage Series</a> | <a href="label-paul-series.html">Paul Series</a> | <a href="label-paul-s-letters--1-corinthians-7.html">Paul's Letters: 1 Corinthians 7</a></p>
