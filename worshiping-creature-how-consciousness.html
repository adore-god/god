<h1>Paul: God Gave Them Up</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Romans 1:24–32 is often read as a moral indictment of human behaviour, but through the teachings of Neville Goddard, it can be seen as something more: a symbolic map of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>. This passage illustrates what happens when the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">human imagination</a>—our creative source and identity—is forgotten, and the outer world is treated as cause rather than effect.</p><p>Paul’s words, far from condemning external acts alone, seem to reveal the spiritual and psychological consequences of denying imagination as the Creator. The spiral into confusion, dishonour, and inner chaos reflects the natural outcome of misplaced assumption—when awareness drifts from its centre and begins to worship what it has created, rather than what creates.</p><p>What follows is a section-by-section exploration of Romans 1:24–32, interpreted through this spiritual psychology—not as divine wrath, but as the outcome of consciousness turned away from its own power.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Impurity Through Misuse of Desire</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity…”</em><br/>
<em>(Romans 1:24)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>When the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> (Exodus 3:14) —your creative awareness—turns away from its true source of power (Imagination), it begins to identify with the external senses. The “lusts of their hearts” symbolise compelling assumptions based on lack, separation, or sensual gratification—imaginative misuses that lead to internal disintegration.</p><p>“God gave them up” doesn’t imply an external deity abandoning them, but rather the natural unfolding of their own assumptions. Imagination respects your freedom—even to misuse it.</p><hr/><h3><strong>The Lie of Outer Worship</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“…they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator…”</em><br/>
<em>(Romans 1:25)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is the core of miscreation: believing in the reality of effects rather than causes. “Worshiping the creature” means taking the outer world (the creature, the effect) as primary, rather than the inner world of Imagination (the Creator, the cause).</p><p>They assumed the world to be fixed and independent, thus placing power in the hands of matter and circumstance instead of acknowledging that your assumptions generate your experiences.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Inversion of Creative Energy</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“For this reason God gave them up to dishonourable passions…”</em><br/>
<em>(Romans 1:26–27)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Symbolically, this section isn’t about literal sexuality, but about the unnatural inversion of consciousness. In Genesis 1:26 Masculine and feminine symbols in Scripture refer to states of giving and receiving—consciousness and subconsciousness.</p><p>To “abandon the natural use” symbolises projecting inward conditions onto outer things unnaturally—using imagination not to generate life, but to mirror fears, guilt, or division. This is the sin defined in Genesis 4:7.</p><p>In this symbolic sense, it reflects the misalignment of masculine (assumption) and feminine (acceptance), resulting in a loop of reactive thinking: desire pursuing desire without conscious direction.</p><hr/><h3><strong>The Debased Mind of Reaction</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind…”</em><br/>
<em>(Romans 1:28)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The “giving up” is not punishment but a principle: you reap what you sow in imagination (Genesis 1:11). To ignore the God within (I AM, Imagination, Exodus 3:14) is to sink into a mindset without creative direction—a “debased mind” that only reacts and never initiates.</p><p>This verse symbolises the death of original thought, where the individual has become enslaved to states of being rooted in fear, shame, and passivity. It is the experience of life as something that “happens to you,” rather than something you create.</p><hr/><h3><strong>A Catalogue of States of Consciousness</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil…”</em><br/>
<em>(Romans 1:29–31)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This list of qualities—envy, murder, deceit, etc.—can be seen as states of consciousness or habitual assumptions. They are not just external behaviours, but inner attitudes that arise because one has forgotten their true creative identity. This is the <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">sin first revealed</a> in Genesis 4:7.</p><h4>For instance:</h4><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Envy</strong> = Assuming separation from the good one desires</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deceit</strong> = Denial of the truth of Imagination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insolence</strong> = Egoic reaction to external conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heartlessness</strong> = Loss of the connection to one’s own creative core</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Each represents a mental or emotional state that, when assumed, will manifest in kind.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Approving Limitation</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Though they know God’s righteous decree… they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.”</em><br/>
<em>(Romans 1:32)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Even when there’s a deep inner awareness that imagination is the creative power, many still ignore it, affirming destructive patterns because they appear “normal” or “logical” in the world.</p><p>“Giving approval” to these states means defending your limitations—affirming lack, doubt, or fear as “realistic.” In doing so, the individual further solidifies these assumptions into their world.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Conclusion: A Call to Remember</strong></h2><p>Romans 1:24–32 can be understood as a psychological map of the fall from divine creative awareness into reactive, sense-bound consciousness. It is not a condemnation of behaviour, but a symbolic portrayal of what unfolds when man forgets that imagination is God in action.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>The passage invites the reader to awaken—to remember that the true power lies within—and that right assumption is the path back to wholeness, peace, and divine order.</em></p></blockquote><div class="share-dropdown">
