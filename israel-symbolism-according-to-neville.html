<h1>What Israel Really Means</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p><a href="scrolls/label-israel-series.html" class="noTag">Israel</a> isn’t just a place or a nation. The Bible is psychological symbolism—<b><i>dressed up</i></b> as history—that turns parts of your mind into people and stories to teach you how your inner world works. According to Neville Goddard, Israel is not a literal nation or geographical location but a symbol of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>—specifically, consciousness awareness of self within each individual.</p><h3>Israel as the Formation of Consciousness Awareness </h3><p><a href="scrolls/label-israel-series.html" class="noTag">Israel</a> represents the formation of thoughts that begin to support the “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” assumption (Exodus 3:14)—the deep inner knowing that you are the creative source of your reality. The name Israel means “One who <a href="jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html">struggles with God</a>” or “God prevails” — from the Hebrew <em><a href="eden-and-sarah-return-to-pleasure-in.html">Sara</a></em> (to struggle) and <em>El</em> (God).</p><p>The story of <a href="eden-and-sarah-return-to-pleasure-in.html">Sarah’s laughter</a> in Genesis marks the first emergence of this new assumption bringing joy and creative pleasure. Despite her old age and doubt, Sarah’s surprise at the promise of a child symbolises the birth of faith in the impossible—a key moment in the formation of Israel as a state of consciousness. Her 'old age' is metaphor for the mind’s belief that it is too late, limited or too unlikely for fulfilment, making her conception a demonstration of the Law of Assumption: that imagination, not logic, is the creative force. This joy and awakening echo the very essence of Israel—the mind’s shift toward believing in and assuming the “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” power within.</p><p>When <a href="jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html">Jacob’s name changes to Israe</a>l, it marks the birth of a new inner identity—one that is self-aware of its power to imagine and assume the end. The <a href="jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html">struggle</a> with "<a href="genesis-126-man.html">men</a>" symbolises the inner conflict involved in forming and identifying with a new, joyful state of being. "<a href="genesis-126-man.html">Men</a>" represent previously dominant ideas or states of consciousness that challenge this emerging self-concept:</p><p></p><blockquote>"And He said, 'Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed." - Genesis 32:28 NLT</blockquote><p></p><p>In the Bible, your conscious awareness is called <a href="elohim-god.html">God (Elohim)</a>. Genesis 1:26 says, <em>"<a href="genesis-126-man.html">Let Us make man in Our image.</a>"</em> This means you are a self-forming consciousness—an awareness that perceives and manifests its own identity.</p><p>In Genesis 32:28, God says to Jacob:<br>
<em>"Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed."</em><br>
This moment shows the transformation from struggling doubt to victorious assumption.</p><h3>The Journey of Spiritual Awakening</h3><p>Neville taught that the story of Israel in the Bible mirrors the journey of spiritual awakening—where one awakens to the power of their own mind and the creative force of their imagination. The struggles and triumphs of the Israelites reflect the inner spiritual journey of the individual learning to use their consciousness to create their reality.</p><p>The Promised Land symbolises the state of divine awareness—a higher state of consciousness aligned with the divine mind, where all desires are fulfilled and peace is found in one’s spiritual power.</p><p>Conversely, the Israelites’ bondage in Egypt represents the condition of being trapped in limited beliefs or spiritual ignorance. The Exodus is the awakening from this bondage—realising one’s own divine creative potential.</p><h3>The Symbolism of the Twelve Tribes</h3><p>Neville also saw the <a href="/search/label/Twelve%20Tribes">twelve tribes</a> of Israel as symbolic of the many aspects of human consciousness—thoughts, feelings, imagination, and will—that must come into alignment for spiritual transformation to occur.</p><h3>Israel: The Inner Struggle and Victory</h3><p><a href="jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html">Jacob wrestling with God</a> and being renamed Israel symbolises the individual’s inner struggle against doubt, resistance, and limiting beliefs. This is the process of transforming consciousness, moving from rebellion to alignment with the “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” assumption.</p><p>This “I AM” is your own awareness, the ultimate creative power behind all experience, as revealed in Exodus 3:14 when God declares:<br>
<em>"I AM WHO I AM."</em></p><p>Throughout the Bible, Israel (your assumption) is often rebellious—symbolising the struggle inside you to hold this truth firmly.</p><h3>Conclusion: Israel as Your Spiritual Awakening</h3><p>So when you think of Israel, think of your mind forming and fixing the “I AM” assumption, ready to manifest your desires. The story of Israel in the Bible is not about a historical people but about every individual’s path to awakening, shedding limiting beliefs, and fulfilling their highest creative potential.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-israel-series.html" class="noTag">Israel Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-jacob-series.html" class="noTag">Jacob Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-names-and-genealogies-series.html" class="noTag">Names and Genealogies Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-numbers--twelve.html" class="noTag">Numbers: Twelve</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-spiritual-geography.html" class="noTag">Spiritual Geography</a></p>
