    <h1>Rosary of Divine Flight: Centered on the Power of Desire and Assumption</h1>
    <p><strong>Opening: Fixed in the Desire</strong></p><p><em>“I put out my hands to you: my soul is turned to you, like a land in need of water.” — Psalm 143:6, BBE</em></p><p>I turn inward, to the only true source. I stretch my hands not to something outside, but to the creative power within. This is the beginning of assumption: the decision to dwell in the end.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Bead One: Shadow of the Wings</strong></h3><p><em>“How good is your loving mercy, O God! the children of men take cover under the shade of your wings.” — Psalm 36:7, BBE</em></p><p>Taking cover under His wings means remaining in the feeling of fulfilment. When I assume the state, I rest under the protective shade of belief. The outside world may shift, but my dwelling place is secured in the imagination.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Three Beads: The Wings Bear Me</strong></h3><ol>
<li>
<p><em>“He will give you into the care of his angels to keep you wherever you go.” — Psalm 91:11, BBE</em><br/>
Assumption is kept alive by inner attention. The angels are my states of consciousness. I go where I dwell in imagination, and that state will sustain me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“They will keep you up, so that your foot may not be crushed.” — Psalm 91:12, BBE</em><br/>
When I walk in the feeling that it is already done, the Law sustains me. I do not fall into reaction or fear, for I am upheld by inner conviction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“You will be covered by his feathers; under his wings you will be safe.” — Psalm 91:4, BBE</em><br/>
To assume is to shelter in certainty. The wings are the structure of belief. I am not trying to make it happen—I dwell in the truth that it is done.</p>
</li>
</ol><hr/><h3><strong>Before the First Decade: Hidden Power</strong></h3><p><em>“Let me be safe under the shade of your wings.” — Psalm 17:8, BBE</em></p><p>Every act of assumption is quiet. No one sees it, but it moves all things. The wing is not display—it is cover. I go inward and remain where the end is already true.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Decade 1: I Am Carried</strong></h3><p><em>“Those who are waiting on the Lord will have new strength; they will get wings like eagles.” — Isaiah 40:31, BBE</em></p><p>To wait is not to delay—it is to remain fixed in the state. The wings of an eagle are the high altitude of faith. I rise by staying loyal to the unseen reality of the wish fulfilled.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Decade 2: I Dwell in the Completed End</strong></h3><p><em>“Let your mercy, O Lord, be over us, as we are waiting for you.” — Psalm 33:22, BBE</em><br/>
<em>Linked symbolically to wings through divine protection</em></p><p>Mercy covers me when I live in the end. What I assume to be true becomes the atmosphere of my life. I live from the result, not toward it.</p><p>(Paired verse for inner repetition):<br/>
<em>“How good is your loving mercy, O God! the children of men take cover under the shade of your wings.” — Psalm 36:7, BBE</em></p><hr/><h3><strong>Decade 3: I Rise Above Circumstances</strong></h3><p><em>“He took me on the wings of the wind.” — 2 Samuel 22:11, BBE</em></p><p>The wing of the wind is imagination in motion. I do not resist appearances—I ascend above them. I lift my state, and by doing so, I lift my world.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Decade 4: I Remain Hidden Until Revealed</strong></h3><p><em>“Let your wings be my secret place.” — Psalm 61:4, BBE</em></p><p>My assumption is not public. It is hidden, just as the seed is hidden in the earth. The wings represent incubation. I remain under them until the state bears fruit.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Decade 5: I Live in the Shelter of Fulfilment</strong></h3><p><em>“He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will be safe.” — Psalm 91:4, BBE (repeated)</em></p><p>To live under the wings is to remain in the finished feeling. I do not revisit the old state. I do not argue with reality. I dwell where it is already so.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Closing: The Flight of Fulfilment</strong></h3><p><em>“Your faith has made you well; go in peace.” — Luke 8:48, BBE</em><br/>
<em>“Let my prayer be ordered before you like sweet-smelling spice.” — Psalm 141:2, BBE</em></p><p>Faith is assumption in action. I leave this prayer in peace, knowing I have moved within. My prayer is not a request—it is a declaration of identity. I go in the consciousness of the wish fulfilled.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-devotional-series.html">Devotional Series</a> | <a href="label-rosary-series.html">Rosary Series</a></p>
