<h1>Laban: The First Shall Be Last</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">



<blockquote>“So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.”  
— Matthew 20:16</blockquote>

<p>At first glance, this statement from Jesus sounds like poetic justice—divine favour for the underdog. But look deeper, and you’ll see something more exact, more mysterious: <strong>a spiritual law governing manifestation.</strong></p>

<p>It’s not about injustice being righted.<br>
It’s about <strong><a class="noTag" href="genesis-224-love.html">Your I AM's creative order stated in Genesis 2:24</a></strong>, where the visible yields to the invisible, the elder serves the younger, and the end is assumed before the beginning.</p>

<p>This is what Neville Goddard called <strong>“living in the end.”</strong><br>
And the Bible is full of it.</p>

<hr>
<h2><strong>Divine Reversal Is Divine Order</strong></h2>
<p>Throughout Scripture, one pattern repeats itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="esau-and-jacob-isaacs-blessing.html"><strong>Esau and Jacob</strong></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="ephraim-and-manasseh.html"><strong>Manasseh and Ephraim</strong></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leah and Rachel</strong></p></li>
<li><p><a href="david-and-saul-inner-battle-of-old-and.html"><strong>Saul and David</strong></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adam and Jesus</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In every pair, the second rises above the first—not to punish the first, but to fulfil the promise.</p>
<p>This is not mere reversal—it is <strong>evolution</strong>.<br>
It shows that manifestation is not chronological.<br>
It’s <strong>imaginal</strong>.</p>
<p>The world sees what comes first.<br>
God honours what comes from within.</p>

<hr>
<h2><strong>Laban: The Old Pattern Trying to Force the Old Order</strong></h2>
<p><a href="breaking-establishment.html">Laban, the father of Leah and Rachel, symbolises the <strong>old pattern</strong></a>—the stubborn external order that attempts to control and impose itself on manifestation.</p>

<blockquote>And Laban said, In our country we do not let the younger daughter be married before the older. - Gen 29:26-26</blockquote>

<p>When <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Jacob</a> desires to <a href="genesis-224-love.html">marry Rachel</a>, Laban deceives him by giving him Leah, the older daughter, first.</p>

<p>This is a powerful spiritual metaphor:<br>
<a href="breaking-establishment.html"><strong>Laban is the resistance of the old order, trying to force the first-born pattern before the new can emerge</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Jacob represents the reader learning to assume the end.<br>
Leah represents the stage where attention is still caught in old patterns.</p>

<p>Jacob realises this imposition is a block to <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">his promise</a>.</p>

<p>So, <strong>he decides to move away</strong>—to break free from Laban’s old pattern and control.<br>
Only after serving seven more years is Jacob finally able to receive Rachel, the beloved younger daughter, symbolising the new imaginal promise.</p>

<p>This shows the spiritual law that the old order must be recognised and decisively left behind before the new can be fully embraced.<br>
Jacob’s departure is an act of breaking free from the imposed old way and choosing the new pattern—<strong>living in the end rather than being bound by appearances.</strong></p>

<hr>
<h2><strong>Jacob and Esau: What the Law of Assumption Teaches</strong></h2>
<p>Esau is born first—rugged, physical, earthy.<br>
Jacob follows—quiet, inner, imaginal.</p>

<p>Esau represents the reader before they have learned to direct attention—focused on the visible, the immediate senses.<br>
<a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Jacob</a> represents the reader who has begun to understand the law of assumption—persistent in imagination, aware of the invisible.</p>

<p>This is not preference.<br>
It’s process.</p>

<p>Your imagination must overtake your senses if you are to manifest your promise.<br>
<a href="esau-and-jacob-isaacs-blessing.html"><strong>What is seen (Esau) must yield to what is assumed (Jacob).</strong></a></p>

<p>This is living in the end.</p>

<hr>
<h2><strong>Manasseh and Ephraim: Fruitfulness Comes Before Forgetting</strong></h2>
<p>When Joseph brings his sons to his Father for a blessing, <a href="ephraim-and-manasseh.html">he places Manasseh—the firstborn—at Israel’s right hand</a>.<br>
But Israel crosses his hands.</p>

<blockquote>“I know, my son, I know… but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he.” (Genesis 48:19)</blockquote>

<p>Manasseh means <em>“forgetting.”</em><br>
Ephraim means <em>“fruitfulness.”</em></p>

<p>Manasseh represents the stage of the reader focused on clearing the past.<br>
Ephraim represents the stage of assuming and living the desired state <strong>before</strong> the past is forgotten.</p>

<p>Neville put it plainly:</p>

<blockquote>“Dare to assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled.”</blockquote>

<p>The forgetting follows the fruit.<br>
The release follows the assumption.<br>
The healing follows the wholeness you dare to live now.</p>

<hr>
<h2><strong>Benjamin and Joseph: The Beloved of the End</strong></h2>
<p><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph is a dreamer</a>. A forerunner. The imaginative man thrown into a pit but destined to rule.</p>

<p>But his beloved is <strong>Benjamin</strong>, the youngest.<br>
<a href="benjamin.html">The one born last.<br>
The one who nearly kills Rachel, Joseph’s spiritual counterpart, preceding David in formation</a>.</p>

<p>Because <strong>Benjamin represents the new birth</strong>—the last thing to appear, but the first in affection and meaning.<br>
He symbolises the thing you treasure most:</p>
<ul>
<li>The final result</li>
<li>The desired state</li>
<li>The completion</li>
</ul>

<p>He is the child of sorrow who becomes the child of the right hand.<br>
<strong>What appears last is what your soul loves most.</strong><br>
This is the blessing of living in the end: <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">You treasure the thing not yet seen, because you already hold it imaginatively</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h2><strong>Saul and David: The Law of Assumption in Action</strong></h2>
<p><a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Saul, as an evolution of Cain</a>, represents the reader caught in old habits, old thinking, and resistance to imagination.<br>
<a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David represents the stage where the reader assumes victory, loves fully, and persists in faith</a>.</p>

<blockquote>“And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as his own soul.” (1 Samuel 18:3)</blockquote>

<p>The world may see Saul as king first.<br>
But the one who assumes the promise (David) will inherit the kingdom.</p>

<p><strong>This shows the law of assumption:</strong> You must persist in imagining the desired outcome before the world recognises it.</p>

<hr>
<h2><strong>Adam and Jesus: The First and Last</strong></h2>
<p>Adam represents the reader in their initial, unformed state—before imagination is fully recognised.<br>
Jesus represents the reader who has assumed the end and lives it fully, regardless of external appearances.</p>

<blockquote>“the firstborn of every creature… the last Adam… a life-giving spirit.”</blockquote>

<p>The world says, “prove it, and then we’ll believe.”<br>
Jesus says, “believe, and it will be.”</p>

<p>His ministry models <strong>living in the end</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="feeding-5000-gospel-comparison.html">Feeding the five thousand</a> with thanksgiving <em>before</em> the bread multiplies.</li>
<li><a href="jesus-wept-for-easter-sunday.html">Calling Lazarus out <em>before</em> the stone is moved</a>.</li>
<li>Saying “It is finished” <em>before</em> the world saw what He finished.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><strong>Neville’s Law: Assume the End, Reverse the Order</strong></h2>
<p>Neville didn’t invent this.<br>
He interpreted it. He <em>remembered</em> it.<br>
He showed us that what the Bible portrays symbolically, we are meant to <strong>live literally—within.</strong></p>

<p>To live in the end is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bless Ephraim before Manasseh</li>
<li>Believe Jacob over Esau</li>
<li>See Benjamin as the beloved</li>
<li>And walk as your chosen self (Christ) before the world ever knows your name</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“To be transformed, the whole basis of your thought must change. Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and continue feeling that it is fulfilled until that which you feel objectifies itself.”  
— Neville Goddard</blockquote>
