<h1>Where Did Manifestation Come From?</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><em>Rediscovering the Sacred Origin Behind a Modern Trend</em></p>
<p>The concept of <em>manifestation</em>&mdash;the idea that your thoughts, beliefs, and feelings create your reality&mdash;is now part of everyday conversation. It shows up in vision boards, daily affirmations, and popular teachings like <em>The Secret</em> or the channellings of Esther and Abraham Hicks.</p>
<p>But as this trend has grown, an essential truth has been largely forgotten: <strong>the origin of manifestation is the Bible.</strong></p>
<p>Not the Bible as read through strict literalism, but the Bible as a symbolic, spiritual record of consciousness. When viewed this way&mdash;as taught by mystics like Neville Goddard&mdash;the Scriptures reveal a profound, timeless guide to creation, imagination, and the law of assumption.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>The Bible: The True Source of Manifestation</strong></h2>
<p>It may surprise many to realise that the deepest manifestation principles being taught today have <em>always</em> been in the Bible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.&rdquo;</strong> (Proverbs 23:7)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Whatsoever things ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 11:24)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&rdquo;</strong> (Hebrews 11:1)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not vague motivational sayings&mdash;they are clear spiritual laws. Neville Goddard saw the Bible not as a historical account, but as a psychological drama&mdash;a story about you, your imagination, and your divine power to bring unseen things into form.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>A Sacred Tradition Lost in Translation</strong></h2>
<p>Modern-day manifestation teachings often present powerful techniques&mdash;affirmations, visualisation, scripting&mdash;but they rarely acknowledge their deeper roots. This is not necessarily due to malice or neglect. In many cases, it&rsquo;s the result of a deeper cultural split: <strong>the Bible has been dismissed by many spiritual seekers because of how literally and rigidly it has been interpreted.</strong></p>
<p>For centuries, the Bible has been read as a historical and moral document rather than a symbolic guide to inner transformation. This has caused many to distance themselves from it entirely&mdash;believing it to be irrelevant, outdated, or oppressive.</p>
<p>As a result, <strong>manifestation has been stripped of its biblical origin</strong>, even though the heart of the practice was <em>always</em> there&mdash;embedded in Scripture, waiting to be rediscovered.</p>
<p>This disconnection is understandable&mdash;but still a tragic loss. Without the symbolic and spiritual context that Scripture provides, manifestation can feel hollow, transactional, or untethered from deeper meaning.</p>
<p>But when we return to the Bible as mystics like Neville Goddard did&mdash;not to interpret it literally, but symbolically&mdash;we uncover a rich, sacred manual for conscious creation.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Neville Goddard: Reuniting Manifestation with Scripture</strong></h2>
<p>Neville taught that the Bible is not a book of external commands, but a map of internal states. Every character and story&mdash;from Adam to Jesus, from Sarah to Mary&mdash;is symbolic of stages within your own soul.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong> symbolises the beloved state&mdash;the manifestation of your desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solomon</strong> represents peace and wisdom&mdash;the sustained fulfilment of that desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus</strong> is the awakened imagination&mdash;the I AM presence that speaks things into being.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When Jesus says, &ldquo;I and my Father are one,&rdquo; Neville interprets this as your <em>awareness</em> being one with the creative force itself.</p>
<p>This sacred understanding restores the depth that many modern teachings lack. It reminds us that manifestation is not just a method&mdash;it is a divine inheritance.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Why It Matters: The Missing Link for Many Seekers</strong></h2>
<p>Many people exploring manifestation today feel there&rsquo;s something missing. They&rsquo;re told to think positively, visualise, and trust the universe&mdash;but often find themselves craving <em>meaning</em>.</p>
<p>They want to know:<br/>
<strong>Where does this come from? Why does it work? Who am I really in this process?</strong></p>
<p>The answer lies not in new philosophies, but in returning to the <em>oldest spiritual book of all</em>&mdash;not read literally, but interpreted through the awakened imagination. When viewed this way, the Bible is not a rulebook but a <em>creative manual</em>&mdash;the original source of conscious creation.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: Returning to the Root of Manifestation</strong></h2>
<p>Manifestation is not a New Age fad. It is a spiritual truth embedded in ancient texts, especially the Bible. When we reclaim this connection, we give manifestation its rightful place&mdash;not as a novelty, but as a sacred act of becoming.</p>
<p>You are not merely &ldquo;attracting&rdquo; things. You are expressing your divine identity, bringing form to the unseen through the inner conviction of being.</p>
<p>As Neville put it:<br/>
<strong>&ldquo;Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. That is the secret.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>So where did manifestation come from?<br/>
It came from the same place you did: from the <em>I AM</em>&mdash;the eternal, creative presence, whispered through the scriptures and awakened through you.</p>
