<h1>Where Did Manifestation Come From?</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p><em>Rediscovering the Sacred Origin Behind a Modern Trend</em></p>
<p>The concept of <em>manifestation</em>—the idea that your thoughts, beliefs, and feelings create your reality—is now part of everyday conversation. It shows up in vision boards, daily affirmations, and popular teachings like <em>The Secret</em> or the channellings of Esther and Abraham Hicks.</p>
<p>But as this trend has grown, an essential truth has been largely forgotten: <strong>the origin of manifestation is the Bible.</strong></p>
<p>Not the Bible as read through strict literalism, but the Bible as a symbolic, spiritual record of consciousness. When viewed this way—as taught by mystics like Neville Goddard—the Scriptures reveal a profound, timeless guide to creation, imagination, and the law of assumption.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Bible: The True Source of Manifestation</strong></h2>
<p>It may surprise many to realise that the deepest manifestation principles being taught today have <em>always</em> been in the Bible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”</strong> (Proverbs 23:7)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Whatsoever things ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”</strong> (Mark 11:24)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”</strong> (Hebrews 11:1)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not vague motivational sayings—they are clear spiritual laws. Neville Goddard saw the Bible not as a historical account, but as a psychological drama—a story about you, your imagination, and your divine power to bring unseen things into form.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>A Sacred Tradition Lost in Translation</strong></h2>
<p>Modern-day manifestation teachings often present powerful techniques—affirmations, visualisation, scripting—but they rarely acknowledge their deeper roots. This is not necessarily due to malice or neglect. In many cases, it’s the result of a deeper cultural split: <strong>the Bible has been dismissed by many spiritual seekers because of how literally and rigidly it has been interpreted.</strong></p>
<p>For centuries, the Bible has been read as a historical and moral document rather than a symbolic guide to inner transformation. This has caused many to distance themselves from it entirely—believing it to be irrelevant, outdated, or oppressive.</p>
<p>As a result, <strong>manifestation has been stripped of its biblical origin</strong>, even though the heart of the practice was <em>always</em> there—embedded in Scripture, waiting to be rediscovered.</p>
<p>This disconnection is understandable—but still a tragic loss. Without the symbolic and spiritual context that Scripture provides, manifestation can feel hollow, transactional, or untethered from deeper meaning.</p>
<p>But when we return to the Bible as mystics like Neville Goddard did—not to interpret it literally, but symbolically—we uncover a rich, sacred manual for conscious creation.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Neville Goddard: Reuniting Manifestation with Scripture</strong></h2>
<p>Neville taught that the Bible is not a book of external commands, but a map of internal states. Every character and story—from Adam to Jesus, from Sarah to Mary—is symbolic of stages within your own soul.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong> symbolises the beloved state—the manifestation of your desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solomon</strong> represents peace and wisdom—the sustained fulfilment of that desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus</strong> is the awakened imagination—the I AM presence that speaks things into being.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When Jesus says, “I and my Father are one,” Neville interprets this as your <em>awareness</em> being one with the creative force itself.</p>
<p>This sacred understanding restores the depth that many modern teachings lack. It reminds us that manifestation is not just a method—it is a divine inheritance.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Why It Matters: The Missing Link for Many Seekers</strong></h2>
<p>Many people exploring manifestation today feel there’s something missing. They’re told to think positively, visualise, and trust the universe—but often find themselves craving <em>meaning</em>.</p>
<p>They want to know:<br>
<strong>Where does this come from? Why does it work? Who am I really in this process?</strong></p>
<p>The answer lies not in new philosophies, but in returning to the <em>oldest spiritual book of all</em>—not read literally, but interpreted through the awakened imagination. When viewed this way, the Bible is not a rulebook but a <em>creative manual</em>—the original source of conscious creation.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: Returning to the Root of Manifestation</strong></h2>
<p>Manifestation is not a New Age fad. It is a spiritual truth embedded in ancient texts, especially the Bible. When we reclaim this connection, we give manifestation its rightful place—not as a novelty, but as a sacred act of becoming.</p>
<p>You are not merely “attracting” things. You are expressing your divine identity, bringing form to the unseen through the inner conviction of being.</p>
<p>As Neville put it:<br>
<strong>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. That is the secret.”</strong></p>
<p>So where did manifestation come from?<br>
It came from the same place you did: from the <em>I AM</em>—the eternal, creative presence, whispered through the scriptures and awakened through you.</p>
