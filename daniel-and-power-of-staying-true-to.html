<h1>Daniel Overview </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The Book of Daniel, like Revelation, isn’t a record of outer history or prophecy. It’s a spiritual drama, revealing how consciousness survives—and eventually transforms—the great <a href="elohim-god.html">kingdoms of the mind</a>. Through Neville Goddard’s understanding of the Bible as psychological truth, Daniel represents the <strong>inner clarity that <a href="genesis-224-love.html">holds fast</a> to the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></strong> amidst the confusion of conditioned belief.</p>
<h2><strong>Daniel as a State of Inner Authority</strong></h2>
<p>Daniel is taken captive into Babylon, a city of splendour and confusion. In Neville’s symbolic reading, <strong>Babylon</strong> represents the <strong>mind dominated by outer appearances</strong>—the unawakened state ruled by fear, tradition, and the five senses. Daniel enters this world but is <strong>not of it</strong>. He refuses the king’s meat and wine—symbols of <strong>absorbing the identity offered by the world</strong>. Instead, he lives by a higher diet: truth revealed inwardly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself.”</em> (Daniel 1:8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To defile oneself, symbolically, is to <strong>believe outer appearances over inner knowing</strong>. Daniel doesn’t fight Babylon. He transcends it through alignment with <strong>the imaginal centre—“I AM”—<a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> in <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a></strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Interpreter of Dreams</strong></h2>
<p>Daniel interprets dreams. Just like Joseph before him, he represents the <strong>developed imagination</strong> that understands that <strong>symbols govern the world</strong>, and that dreams are the subconscious revealing the state of the dreamer. When Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a great statue made of different metals—gold, silver, bronze, iron—Daniel tells him what it means.</p>
<p>In symbolic terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>statue</strong> is the <em>composite self</em>—a towering identity built from human reason, culture, fear, power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>stone cut without hands</strong> that smashes it is <strong>imagination</strong>—not of this world, but from within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>kingdom that follows</strong> is not external, but the kingdom of awakened awareness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the breaking down of worldly belief and the revealing of the <strong>inner Christ</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Fiery Furnace: Testing Your Imaginal Conviction</strong></h2>
<p>Daniel’s three companions—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—are thrown into a furnace for refusing to bow to an image. This is not a tale of martyrdom. It’s <strong>the dramatization of imaginal testing</strong>.</p>
<p>The image they refuse is the <strong>false god of appearances</strong>—outer evidence, circumstance, and fear. The furnace is symbolic of <strong>intensity</strong>—when life heats up, will you still believe in what you’ve imagined?</p>
<p>They pass the test, and in the fire, a fourth man appears: <em>“like unto the Son of God.”</em></p>
<p>This is the <strong>emergence of the real identity</strong>—the Christ within—revealed only when the false is denied.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Daniel in the Lions' Den: Dominion Over the Subconscious</strong></h2>
<p>Daniel is thrown into the lions' den for praying to his God—remaining faithful to the inner voice instead of conforming to law. The lions, wild and threatening, represent the <strong>subconscious mind untamed</strong>—dangerous only when approached in fear.</p>
<p>Daniel remains calm. The lions do not harm him.</p>
<p>Neville often taught that <strong>the subconscious accepts what the conscious impresses upon it</strong>. The key is inner control. Daniel doesn’t plead, panic, or try to escape. He remains still—<em>knowing who he is</em>—and thus, the lions are rendered powerless.</p>
<p>This is true dominion over the lower mind ('beast'). The awakened no longer fears the pull of old assumptions</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Final Vision: The Son of Man and the Ancient of Days</strong></h2>
<p>Daniel’s later visions become more abstract, resembling Revelation. He sees beasts rise from the sea (the subconscious), and finally, a vision of the <strong>Ancient of Days</strong> giving authority to <strong>one like the Son of Man</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the <strong>moment of inheritance</strong>—when the divine imagination (the Son) is recognised and enthroned. It mirrors Revelation’s <strong>Lamb on the throne</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: Daniel Is You—When You Remember the Truth in the Midst of Illusion</strong></h2>
<p>Daniel represents the part of you that <strong>refuses to forget imagination</strong>, even when taken into the heart of Babylon—the conditioned, doubting world. He shows that <strong>inner clarity rules even in exile</strong>, and that God’s kingdom is <strong>within</strong>—not in gold or empire, but in quiet alignment with “I AM”.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
