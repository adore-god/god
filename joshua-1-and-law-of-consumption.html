<h1>Joshua 1 and the Law of Consumption: Devouring What You Dwell Upon</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><em>“After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses' servant, ‘Moses my servant is dead; now then, you and all these people get ready to go over the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them, to the Israelites.’”</em> (Joshua 1:1–2 BBE)</p>
<p>The opening of Joshua 1 is not merely a change in leadership—it symbolizes a profound shift in consciousness. Moses, the symbol of the old law, has passed. Now, Joshua—whose name means <em>"Yahweh is salvation"</em>—is called to rise and lead the people into their promise. In the realm of manifestation, this moment marks the transition from knowing the truth to living it, from theory to practice.</p>
<p><em>“I have given you every place where the sole of your foot will tread, just as I promised to Moses.”</em> (Joshua 1:3 BBE)</p>
<p>In the metaphysical sense, this passage highlights the power of assumption. To “tread upon” something is to mentally occupy it, to dwell within a vision until it becomes reality. The Law of Consumption teaches that we <em>become</em> what we consistently focus on. Joshua’s command to step onto the land symbolizes how, by consuming the vision of a fulfilled desire, we manifest it into being.</p>
<p><em>“No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you or forsake you.”</em> (Joshua 1:5 BBE)</p>
<p>This verse offers a profound assurance. God tells Joshua that no one will be able to oppose him, just as He was with Moses. Spiritually, this is a reminder that as you align with your inner vision, no external force can disrupt your journey. The universe, or the divine within, will not fail you. When you consume the image of success, the forces of the world align to bring it into being. The inner assurance that accompanies this image allows you to proceed confidently, knowing that all things will work together for your good.</p>
<p><em>“Only be strong and very courageous, and be careful to do all the law which Moses My servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may be successful wherever you go.”</em> (Joshua 1:7 BBE)</p>
<p>The call for courage is a call to <em>focus</em>. Joshua is not being asked for bravery in battle but in his <em>thoughts</em>. True courage lies in resisting the pull of doubt and maintaining focus on the mental images of the promised outcome. Success, in Neville Goddard’s terms, doesn’t come from action alone—it flows from the steadfast commitment to a mental state, the <em>imagination</em>, that aligns with your goal.</p>
<p><em>“This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth; but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.”</em> (Joshua 1:8 BBE)</p>
<p>The <em>Book of the Law</em> is a metaphor for the imagination. It is the sacred space where all creation begins. When God commands Joshua to meditate on the book day and night, He is not just telling him to read words, but to dwell upon the mental image, to feed his imagination with the vision of the fulfilled promise until it becomes his reality. By <em>consuming</em> this vision, Joshua becomes the living expression of it.</p>
<p><em>“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid, do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.”</em> (Joshua 1:9 BBE)</p>
<p>The ultimate assurance comes with the reminder that God (the divine within you) is with you wherever your imagination goes. The courage to move forward comes from the knowledge that you are not creating a new reality from nothing—you are simply consuming and embodying the truth of your own inner being. As you imagine, so you shall be.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In summary, Joshua 1 invites us to embrace the Law of Consumption: to consume, meditate, and embody the vision we wish to manifest. The <em>Book of the Law</em>—our imagination—is the creative power, and by constantly feeding our minds with the image of our desires, we make them our reality.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
