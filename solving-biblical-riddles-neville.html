<h1>Parables and their Answers</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The Bible has often been read as a historical or moral text, but Neville Goddard invites us to look deeper. He taught that the Bible is not the record of ancient peoples or events, but a symbolic map of the human psyche. Its riddles and parables aren’t religious puzzles—they’re practical keys to understanding consciousness and imagination </p><p>Through Neville’s interpretations, these hidden teachings become accessible and alive, offering transformative insight into who we are and what we can create.</p><hr/><h3><strong>“Who hath ascended into heaven…” — <em>Proverbs 30:4</em></strong></h3><p>This poetic riddle challenges us to ask: <a href="who-has-wrapped-up-waters-riddle-and.html">who truly holds the power to ascend and descend, to control the wind and bind the waters?</a> Neville interprets this as a mystical riddle pointing inward.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>“Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?”</em> refers to mastering your inner conversation and energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Who hath bound the waters in a garment?”</em> reflects clothing your desires in feeling—impressing the subconscious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“What is his name?”</em> Neville’s answer: <em>I AM</em>—the divine name of God in man.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Verse:</strong> <em>Proverbs 30:4</em></p><hr/><h3>2. <strong>“The widow’s mites” — <em>Mark 12:41–44</em></strong></h3><p>A poor widow gives all she has—two tiny coins—while the wealthy give from their abundance. Jesus praises her gift.</p><p>Neville saw this as symbolic of giving your whole attention to your desire. The “widow” represents the subconscious, and the “mites” are your last ounce of belief and feeling. Giving all means total inner commitment, no holding back.</p><p><strong>Verse:</strong> <em>Mark 12:41–44</em></p><hr/><h3>3. <strong>“Build your house on the rock” — <em>Matthew 7:24–27</em></strong></h3><p>The wise man builds on a rock; the foolish man on sand. When storms come, only the house on rock stands.</p><p>Neville interprets the rock as a firm assumption—the unshakable belief in your fulfilled desire. Sand represents fleeting thoughts, doubt, or circumstance. Your inner conviction is what sustains you.</p><p><strong>Verse:</strong> <em>Matthew 7:24–27</em></p><hr/><h3>4. <strong>“The prodigal son” — <em>Luke 15:11–32</em></strong></h3><p>A young man demands his inheritance and squanders it, only to return home where he’s welcomed with love.</p><p>Neville taught that this story symbolises the journey of consciousness: leaving the state of divine awareness to experience limitation, then returning to the awareness of I AM. The “father” is your higher self—always ready to receive you back the moment you assume your true identity.</p><p><strong>Verse:</strong> <em>Luke 15:11–32</em></p><hr/><h3>5. <strong>“Let the dead bury the dead” — <em>Luke 9:60</em></strong></h3><p>Jesus’ statement seems harsh on the surface. But Neville reads this as a call to awaken.</p><p>“Dead” symbolises the unaware, those stuck in past beliefs or external appearances. When you realise your imagination is the only reality, you leave behind the old self and walk in your new assumption.</p><p><strong>Verse:</strong> <em>Luke 9:60</em></p><hr/><h3>6. <strong>“The stone the builders rejected” — <em>Psalm 118:22; Luke 20:17</em></strong></h3><p>Neville saw this “stone” as your imagination—rejected by society, but it is the key to creation.</p><p>The “builders” are the rational mind, external authorities, and material beliefs. The power they overlook—your awareness of being—is the cornerstone of all that is built in your world.</p><p><strong>Verses:</strong> <em>Psalm 118:22</em> and <em>Luke 20:17</em></p><hr/><h3>7. <strong>“The fig tree cursed” — <em>Mark 11:12–14, 20–21</em></strong></h3><p>Jesus curses a fig tree for bearing no fruit, even though it’s out of season.</p><p>Neville explained this as rejecting appearances that do not align with your assumption. The tree represents circumstances. You are not to accept limitations—even if “reasonable”—but to live from your fulfilled desire.</p><p><strong>Verse:</strong> <em>Mark 11:12–14, 20–21</em></p><hr/><h3>8. <strong>“I stand at the door and knock” — <em>Revelation 3:20</em></strong></h3><p>This verse depicts Christ standing at the door of your heart.</p><p>For Neville, this is the invitation of desire. Your longing knocks. When you accept it and imagine its fulfilment, you allow the divine to express through you. The door is consciousness. You must open it inwardly.</p><p><strong>Verse:</strong> <em>Revelation 3:20</em></p><hr/><h3>9. <strong>“Let there be light” — <em>Genesis 1:3</em></strong></h3><p>Neville taught that light symbolises awareness. The moment you say <em>“Let there be light,”</em> you awaken. You begin the journey of conscious creation. Creation starts not with effort, but with illumination.</p><p><strong>Verse:</strong> <em>Genesis 1:3</em></p><hr/><h3>10. <strong>“Out of Egypt have I called my son” — <em>Hosea 11:1; Matthew 2:15</em></strong></h3><p>Egypt represents bondage—living by the senses. God calling “his son” out of Egypt is the call to rise from outer appearance to inner truth.</p><p>Neville saw the “son” as your awakened imagination, being called back to its rightful role as creator.</p><p><strong>Verses:</strong> <em>Hosea 11:1</em> and <em>Matthew 2:15</em></p><hr/><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Hidden Meanings</strong></h3><p>The riddles and parables of the Bible aren’t merely moral teachings or religious symbolism. They are encoded instructions for awakening the power of imagination, assumption, and consciousness. Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not a record of external history but a psychological drama—each character, event, and place symbolising states of consciousness within you.</p><p>By interpreting these riddles through Neville’s teachings, you unlock the practical secrets of spiritual transformation. These are not abstract metaphors—they are living principles that, when applied, lead to the fulfilment of your desires and the revelation of your true creative nature.</p><p><br/></p>
