<h1>The Burial of Jesus in Richness</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>

    When we read the Gospel of John with Neville Goddard’s teachings in mind, one vivid detail stands out: <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> is buried in the tomb of a rich man, Joseph of Arimathea. This is more than a historical note; it’s a  symbol of the new assumption Jesus carried throughout his story — an assumption so rich and noble, that even in death he is placed in wealth. It reveals the inner state he maintained: a consciousness of abundance and fulfilment. And it is this unwavering assumption that leads to his ultimate glorification. It's no small detail that <a href="the-lineage-of-christ-journey-through.html">Joseph's name means 'increase'</a>, and Joseph's name appears <a href="the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">twice</a> in the lineage.<h2>The Rich Man’s Tomb: Symbol of Abundance Assumed</h2><p>In the narrative, Jesus’ burial in a rich man’s tomb fulfils Isaiah 53’s prophecy and stands as a significant signpost. Burial here can be seen as the entombing of old beliefs, the laying to rest of previous states of consciousness. But why specifically a rich man’s tomb?</p><p><strong>The event is recorded in all four Gospels, each offering a symbolic lens that supports Neville Goddard’s principle of living in the end — assuming the fulfilled state as present fact:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Matthew 27:57</strong></p><blockquote>“<i>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus</i>.”</blockquote><p><strong>Matthew 27:59–60</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Neville-style interpretation:</strong><br>
Matthew emphasises the tomb as <em>Joseph's own</em> — a possession, carefully carved, clean, and prepared. Jesus is buried not in borrowed obscurity, but in ownership and order. This reflects the consciousness of <em>divine establishment</em> — the assumption that one is already rich in identity and prepared for glorification.</p><hr><p><strong>Mark 15:46</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Neville-style interpretation:</strong><br>
Mark’s account stresses <em>the act of purchase</em> — a transaction has occurred. In symbolic terms, this reflects the conscious <em>investment in a new state</em>. When one assumes the end, there is a cost: letting go of old identities to clothe the new with fine linen — the clean fabric of a renewed mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Luke 23:53</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Neville-style interpretation:</strong><br>
Luke highlights the <em>newness</em> of the tomb — untouched, unspoiled, undefiled. This signifies a fresh assumption, a state of being not conditioned by the past. Jesus is placed into a consciousness completely unmarked by doubt or precedent — the pure imagination of fulfilled desire.</p><hr><p><strong>John 19:41–42</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Neville-style interpretation:</strong><br>
John offers perhaps the most striking symbolism — <em>a garden near the place of crucifixion</em>. This juxtaposition of death and life, ending and beginning, speaks of regeneration. The tomb is in a garden: symbol of blooming consciousness. Even in the darkest hour, the seed of a new reality is already planted nearby.</p><hr><h2>Unity and Glory: The Desired End</h2><p>Jesus’ prayer in John 17:22, <em>“that they may be one, even as we are one,”</em> reveals his inner reality — a unity with divine source that he assumes is also accessible to others. This unity is part of the glorification Jesus claims: a oneness that expresses fullness and completion.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s terms, Jesus is living in the end — already assuming the fulfilled state of being, not as an abstract hope but as a living reality.</p><h2>Life Abundantly: Overflowing Fulfilment</h2><p>John 10:10 states Jesus came <em>“that they may have life, and have it more abundantly.”</em> This is a clear declaration of the richness he assumes for all. It’s not just spiritual survival but the overflowing of life in all aspects — joy, creativity, purpose, even material sufficiency.</p><p>The richness Jesus assumes is a state — a consciousness from which abundance naturally flows.</p><h2>It Is Finished: The Completion of Assumption</h2><p>When Jesus declares, <em>“It is finished”</em> (John 19:30), it marks the <a href="creation-is-finished-stepping-into.html">completion of the journey of assumption</a>. The old limitations are overcome; the new divine identity is established fully.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, this is the moment where the imagined reality is fully manifested — the “end” is now present. The rich man’s tomb, then, is not incidental; it’s a symbol that this assumed glory and abundance receive him even in death.</p><h2>Conclusion: Richness Beyond the Material</h2><p>To be buried in a rich man’s tomb is a profound symbol of Jesus’ assumed wish — to embody and demonstrate the richness of divine life and identity. It shows us that the ultimate assumption isn’t about external riches alone but about assuming glorification, unity, and abundant life as an inner reality that transcends appearances.</p><p><strong>This teaches us that the power of assumption is to declare ourselves rich — rich in life, rich in identity, rich in divine presence — even before it shows in the world. The tomb is not the end, but the sealed chamber of resurrection.</strong></p><div class="share-dropdown">
