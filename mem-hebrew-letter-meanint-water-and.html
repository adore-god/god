<blockquote>
“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. — Genesis 1:1–2 ESV
</blockquote>


<p>This article is about <strong>Mem (מ)</strong> — not theology or gender, but the <strong>implicit memory of the mind encoded in Scripture</strong>.</p>

<p>The Bible never literally says “memory,” yet it consistently shows how <strong>assumptions are received, retained, and carried forward</strong>. Women whose names begin with M (Mary, Miriam, Mariam) are symbolic representations of this process. They are <strong>personifications of Mem</strong>, the medium through which the mind sustains and nurtures imaginative assumptions until they become reality.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What Mem Means Psychologically</h2>

<p>In the <a href="the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Mather’s Table</a>, <strong>Mem corresponds to water</strong>. Psychologically, this signifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>the part of mind that <strong>retains impressions</strong></li>
<li>the medium where <strong>assumptions are sustained</strong></li>
<li>the inner continuity that carries thought from inception to manifestation</li>
<li><strong>feeling formed in advance</strong> that persists beyond conscious attention</li>
</ul>

<p>Neville Goddard’s principle — “feeling is the secret” — aligns perfectly. Feeling is not mood; it is <strong>the subconscious retention of an assumption</strong>, which the Bible encodes symbolically.</p>

<p>Water is used because memory:</p>
<ul>
<li>receives and reflects impressions</li>
<li>deepens over time</li>
<li>outlasts conscious awareness</li>
<li>gives form to what was once invisible</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, creation begins with <strong>air (thought) meeting <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-water-symbolism.html">water (Mem)</a></strong>, not with action. The Bible encodes the mechanism of imagination and retention.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Genesis: Implicit Memory in Action</h2>

<h3>Genesis 1:2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Waters = Mem → latent memory/receptive substrate</li>
<li>Hovering = Aleph poised to impress</li>
<li>Darkness/void = potential, not yet impressed</li>
</ul>

<p>This is memory implied: <strong>ready to receive and retain <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">the seed</a> of imagination</strong>.</p>

<h4>Genesis 2:23</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh…”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Recognition of continuity within the mind</a></li>
<li>The text personifies a faculty that <strong>holds and carries forward the assumption of self</strong></li>
<li>Mem is operating implicitly here, though the word is never used</li>
</ul>

<h4>Genesis 2:24 — Leaving Father and Mother</h4>

<ul>
<li>Father = originating thought (Aleph)</li>
<li>Mother = retention medium (Mem)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="genesis-224-love.html">To leave them is <strong>to begin conscious authorship</strong></a>, directing Mem deliberately rather than inheriting old impressions unconsciously.</p>

<hr>
<h4>Moab — Territory of the Mind</h4>

<ul>
<li>Father = originating thought (Aleph)</li>
<li>Mother = retention medium (Mem)</li>
<li>Moab = field of inherited impressions, conditioning, and mental territory to be integrated or transcended</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="moab-and-israel-divided-offspring-of.html">To enter Moab is <strong>to face inherited patterns of the mind</strong></a>, recognising both the influences of thought and memory, and learning to consciously direct them toward imagination rather than being unconsciously bound by old mental territory.</p>

<h2>Women as Psychological States</h2>

<p><a href="why-are-there-so-many-marys-in-new.html">All the women in the Bible whose names begin with M</a> personify <strong>different states of Mem</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="sarahs-laughter-humour-of-manifestation.html">Sarah</a>, <a href="rebekahs-beauty-at-well-flow-of-living.html">Rebekah</a>, <a href="rachels-flight-shedding-old-assumptions.html">Rachel</a></strong> — memory not yet impressed, waiting for persistence of assumption</li>
<li><a href="el/hannah-favour-dedication.html"><strong>Hannah</strong></a> — memory forming silently, impressions taken inwardly before manifestation</li>
<li><a href="ruth-and-boaz.html"><strong>Ruth</strong></a> — memory that clings and sustains, loyalty to assumption until it bears fruit</li>
<li><a href="becoming-queen-unlocking-your-power.html"><strong>Esther</strong> — memory under constraint, holding identity inwardly until action is taken </a></li>
<li><strong><a href="why-are-there-so-many-marys-in-new.html">Marys</a></strong> — mature states of Mem; fully receptive, stable, faithful, and able to carry the Word to manifestation</li>
</ul>

<p>Psychologically, the stories of these women encode <strong>how imagination moves into, resides in, and emerges from Mem</strong>. They illustrate that <strong>what is remembered becomes lived</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Jesus and His Interactions with Water</h3>

<ul>
<li>Water = Mem, the receptive, sustaining waters of the mind</li>
<li><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus = guiding the reader through the state of being saved</a>, showing how to move in harmony with feeling and assumption</li>
<li>Miracles = demonstrations of healing and harmonising the different memories and parts of the mind</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="zebulunthe-sea-honour-and-dwelling.html">When Jesus walks on water </a>, calms the storm, or turns water into wine, it symbolises <strong>how the mind can navigate, calm, and transform the waters, or rather the responses and memories within</strong>. These acts guide the reader through the experience of living in the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assumed state of having their desire fulfilled</a>, showing that salvation is entered by feeling and attention <a href="tamar-and-absalom-when-imagination-is.html">rather than by force</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Walking on water = moving with confidence across the waters of the mind</li>
<li>Calming the storm = bringing stillness to turbulent inner waters, aligning feeling and attention</li>
<li>Turning water into wine = demonstrating how ordinary inner waters can be transfigured into fulfilled experience through assumption</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mem and the Law of Assumption</h2>

<ol>
<li>An idea (air) is introduced.</li>
<li>Mem (water) receives and sustains it.</li>
<li>What is retained persists as inner reality.</li>
<li>Persistence in Mem leads to external manifestation.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Bible teaches this principle symbolically through narrative, not by naming it. Each woman represents a stage or state of <strong>memory in action</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion: The Water That Remembers</h2>

<p>Mem and water are symbols to teach about the fluid, receptive and holding nature of imagination. It is not the thought itself, nor the momentary feeling, but <strong>the faculty that retains, sustains, and carries assumptions until they manifest as lived experience</strong>.</p>

<p>The <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">women of Scripture</a> are <strong>maps of memory</strong>, showing how assumptions are received, nurtured, held, and finally embodied. Change Mem, and reality must follow.</p>
