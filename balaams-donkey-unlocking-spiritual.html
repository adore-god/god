<h1>Balaam’s Donkey</h1>

<blockquote> 
“Issachar is a strong donkey,
crouching between the sheepfolds.
He saw that a resting place was good,
and that the land was pleasant,
so he bowed his shoulder to bear,
and became a servant at forced labor." - Genesis 49:14-15

<p>In Numbers 22, the story of Balaam and his donkey unfolds as a rich allegory of consciousness. Through Neville Goddard's teachings, this narrative reveals the journey from being directed by external circumstances to the awakening and integration of imagination within the self. The story portrays an internal dialogue, where resistance gives way to recognition of the higher state of consciousness and the realisation of desires.</p>
<h3><strong>Balaam’s Name: Resistance and External Influence</strong></h3>
<p>Balaam's name, <strong>Bilʿam</strong> (בִּלְעָם), can be interpreted as “not of the people” or “destruction of the people,” offering insight into the spiritual lessons of the story.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>"Not of the People":</strong> Balaam represents the conscious self disconnected from its true, higher aspect—easily influenced by external forces rather than inner guidance. His struggle mirrors our own effort to align conscious choices with inner truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Destruction of the People":</strong> Neville teaches that old, limiting beliefs must be dismantled to make space for new possibilities. Here, this phrase signifies the breaking down of internal resistance, allowing expansive states of awareness to emerge.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Baal: External Control and Influence</strong></h3>
<p><strong><a class="aforce" href="scrolls/label-baal-series.html">Baal</a></strong> represents external authority or influence, such as societal norms, material desire, or ingrained habits. When Balaam responds to King Balak, he symbolises the conscious mind yielding to pressures outside itself. True power, Neville emphasises, comes from within—through the awakening and use of imagination.</p>
<h3><strong>The Donkey: An Aspect of Self Responding to Truth</strong></h3>
<p>In this interpretation, the donkey is a facet of Balaam himself—an aspect of self that reacts, perceives, and guides. Unlike Balaam’s awareness, the donkey recognises the angel standing in the path, reflecting a part of self now more attuned to the spiritual direction. It is a living, active participant in consciousness. </p>
<p>The donkey’s resistance signifies the internal struggle of self, which must reconcile old patterns with new awareness. Its hesitancy mirrors our own internal hesitation when confronting the shift toward the fulfilled state we imagine. Through this interaction, the donkey functions as a teacher within consciousness, revealing where alignment is needed.</p>
<p>
<a href="el/jesus-riding-donkey.html">Jesus' entry on the donkey in the New Testament</a> shows an aspect of self now fully conditioned and disciplined to carry the new anointed assumption
</p>
<h3><strong>The Angel: Awakening to the Wish Fulfilled</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="el/bible-angels-symbolism.html"><strong>angel</strong> represents the awakening to the wish fulfilled—the part of consciousness recognising that the desired state already exists within imagination</a>. The angel does not merely block the path; it signals higher awareness, prompting Balaam’s self-aspect to realign with the fulfilled state.</p>
<p>This confrontation illustrates the moment when internal resistance meets truth. The angel embodies the realisation that the state we seek is already present, awaiting acknowledgement within consciousness.</p>
<h3><strong>The Blows: Effort and Internal Realignment</strong></h3>
<p>When Balaam strikes the donkey, the blows symbolise the conscious effort required to integrate resistant aspects of self with higher awareness. Transformation involves addressing old patterns and guiding internal forces to align with imagination and fulfilled desire.</p>
<p>The struggle is productive: friction between conscious intention and reactive aspects of self facilitates growth, helping consciousness release outdated patterns and embrace a higher truth.</p>
<h3><strong>Loyalty of the Donkey: Dedication of Self to Integration</strong></h3>
<p>Despite the challenge, the donkey remains committed—symbolising the inherent dedication of all aspects of self to eventual realignment. With proper guidance, resistant aspects of consciousness can become allies, supporting the fulfilment of desire once integrated with higher awareness.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Awakening and Integration of Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>Balaam’s story is an allegory of consciousness coming into harmony with imagination. Resistance, confrontation, and eventual alignment illustrate the process of internal realignment. The <a href="el/bible-angels-symbolism.html">angel signifies recognition of the fulfilled state</a>, and the donkey’s responses demonstrate the role of reactive aspects of self in guiding growth.</p>
<p>The journey to manifestation is therefore internal. It requires overcoming resistance, integrating aspects of self, and aligning all faculties with the higher truth of imagination. As Balaam realigns with the divine message, we too awaken to the fulfilment of our desires, bringing conscious imagination into harmony with our deepest intentions and spiritual purpose.</p>
