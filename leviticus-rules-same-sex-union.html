<h1>Leviticus Rules: Same 'Sex' Union</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<blockquote><p><strong>&ldquo;Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.&rdquo;</strong><br/>
&mdash; <em>Leviticus 18:22 (KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination&hellip;&rdquo;</strong><br/>
&mdash; <em>Leviticus 20:13 (KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>These two verses from Leviticus are among the most often cited in discussions of biblical law. Traditionally interpreted as prohibitions against homosexual relations, they have sparked intense cultural debate. But if, as Neville Goddard taught, the Bible is a psychological document&mdash;a spiritual guide describing inner processes rather than outer conduct&mdash;then these verses contain far deeper and more transformative meaning.</p><h2><strong>Neville Goddard and the Symbolic Scripture</strong></h2><p>Neville Goddard repeatedly emphasised that the Bible is not literal history, but a symbolic revelation of <strong>how the mind creates reality</strong>. He insisted that its true meaning unfolds only when one recognises that its language is the language of the soul.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Bible is addressed to the imagination&mdash;which is spiritual sensation&mdash;and only to those who are awake is the word addressed.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Every man, woman, place, and action in Scripture takes place <strong>within</strong>. The &ldquo;abominations&rdquo; of Leviticus, then, are not crimes of flesh but <strong>violations of inner law</strong>&mdash;breakdowns in the correct union of conscious and subconscious faculties.</p><h2><strong>The Masculine and Feminine Within</strong></h2><p>In symbolic language:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>masculine</strong> represents the <strong>conscious mind</strong>&mdash;reason, decision, identity, the &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>feminine</strong> symbolises the <strong>subconscious</strong>&mdash;imagination, feeling, receptivity, and creative potential.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For manifestation to occur, these two must be joined. The masculine impresses an idea onto the feminine. The subconscious receives and brings forth that idea into experience. This is the sacred, invisible union behind all creation.</p><h2><strong>&ldquo;A Man Shall Not Lie with Mankind&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; The Error of Empty Ritual and Reason</strong></h2><p>Symbolically, the command <em>&ldquo;a man shall not lie with mankind, as with womankind&rdquo;</em> warns against trying to <strong>create using only reason, belief systems, or outward ritual</strong>.</p><p>It is a sterile union&mdash;logic attempting to commune with logic, dogma with dogma&mdash;without imagination, without inner feeling, without the fertile soil of belief. In Neville&rsquo;s terms, it is the mistake of <strong>externalising God</strong> and expecting transformation through <strong>mental effort alone</strong>, ignoring the divine womb of the subconscious.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Prayer is the art of assuming the feeling of being and having that which you desire.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To lie with &ldquo;mankind&rdquo; is to stay trapped in thought loops and mechanical affirmations, never descending into true emotional acceptance or spiritual embodiment.</p><h2><strong>Leviticus 20:13 &ndash; Why the Penalty is &ldquo;Death&rdquo;</strong></h2><p>The symbolic punishment described in Leviticus 20:13 is not physical death, but the <strong>death of manifestation</strong>&mdash;the failure of inner conception.</p><p>When inner faculties are misaligned&mdash;when imagination is left out of the process&mdash;<strong>nothing is born</strong>. No result comes forth. The union is void. This is the death of creation, the stillborn child of misused spiritual law.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Be not deceived: God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; <em>Galatians 6:7</em></p>
</blockquote><p>There is no &ldquo;reaping&rdquo; when the sowing takes place in a barren field of overthinking or outward performance.</p><h2><strong>A Symbolic Extension: If a Woman Lies with a Woman</strong></h2><p>While not stated in the text, Neville's symbolic framework invites us to explore the inverse: <strong>what happens when the feminine lies with the feminine</strong>?</p><p>This would represent <strong>imagination operating without direction</strong>&mdash;emotions drifting, visualisations floating, desires forming without clarity of identity. It is creativity unanchored. A woman lying with a woman is imagination communing with itself, never receiving a seed from the conscious &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; to form identity around.</p><p>This union also fails to produce manifestation, not through sterility but through chaos. Without deliberate direction, the subconscious remains in fantasy, never firming itself into form.</p><h2><strong>The True Sacred Union: Consciousness and Imagination in Harmony</strong></h2><p>The solution is always the same: the <strong>sacred marriage</strong> of masculine and feminine within.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The conscious mind chooses and affirms: &ldquo;I AM successful.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The subconscious accepts and feels it as true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The result is expression: success in the outer world.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the divine pattern. Every story of conception in the Bible&mdash;from Abraham and Sarah to Mary and the Holy Ghost&mdash;symbolises this spiritual law.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;You are already that which you want to be, and your refusal to believe this is the only reason you do not see it.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><h2><strong>In Summary</strong></h2><p>Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 are not about human relationships at all, but about the <strong>divine mechanics of manifestation</strong>. They warn us not to rely on logic alone, nor to indulge in imagination without identity. They speak of improper inner unions&mdash;sterile connections that violate the law of creation and lead to the death of possibility.</p><p>Read symbolically, they become not weapons of exclusion but powerful tools of awakening, calling us into conscious union with the divine creative process.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
