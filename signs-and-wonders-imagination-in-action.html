<h1>Signs and Wonders: Imagination in Action</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The Bible is full of <em>&ldquo;signs and wonders.&rdquo;</em> Seas part, fire falls from heaven, the dead rise, and the sick are healed. To the literal mind, these are external miracles&mdash;suspensions of natural law. But to those who&rsquo;ve discovered the secret behind Neville Goddard&rsquo;s teachings, something else is being revealed: <em>these are not external interventions, but internal breakthroughs.</em> These signs and wonders are the visible results of an invisible process&mdash;<em>imagination in action</em>.</p>
<p>Neville taught that the Bible is not a record of outer events, but a psychological blueprint. Every character, every event, every miracle is symbolic of something happening in you. When the Bible says &ldquo;with signs and wonders the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt,&rdquo; it is saying that <em>through the power of imaginative conviction, man is lifted out of bondage to his current circumstances</em>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>What Are Signs and Wonders, Really?</strong></h3>
<p>A &ldquo;<b>sign</b>&rdquo; is the <b>echo</b> of an internal <b>assumption</b> made real. A &ldquo;<b><i>wonder</i></b>&rdquo; is the natural result of <b><i>consciousness</i></b> <b><i>shifting</i></b> so fully into a new state that the outer world must comply. These are not interruptions of reality&mdash;they <em>are</em> reality, unfolding from a deeper level.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Moses turning his rod into a serpent</strong> is not sleight of hand&mdash;it&rsquo;s a sign that the rigid line of belief (the rod) can be quickened into creative energy (the serpent) through focused imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elijah calling down fire</strong> symbolises the fiery determination that burns through resistance. It is not fire from above&mdash;it is passion from within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus healing the blind and lame</strong> is imagination beholding someone in a new state&mdash;and that state becoming flesh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The loaves and fishes multiplying</strong> isn&rsquo;t a trick&mdash;it&rsquo;s a demonstration of how even the smallest seed of belief, once felt as real, can feed the multitude of your world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Why Signs Follow, Not Lead</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These signs shall follow those who believe&hellip;&rdquo; (Mark 16:17)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice: <em>follow</em>. Not precede. The inner conviction comes first&mdash;the miracle is the effect, not the cause. Signs don&rsquo;t produce belief; they <em>prove</em> it. They are the shadow cast by a new assumption. They are imagination wearing form.</p>
<p>Neville often said, <em>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t persist in imagining a state and not express it.&rdquo;</em> That expression&mdash;whether healing, freedom, abundance, or peace&mdash;is your sign and wonder. It is the world echoing back what you dared to believe in the silence.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>You Are the Sign</strong></h3>
<p>You are not here to chase signs&mdash;you <em>are</em> the sign. Your transformation, your unfolding, your movement from one state of being to another, <em>is the wonder</em>. The parting of the Red Sea is your breakthrough. The raising of Lazarus is your buried dream returning. These aren&rsquo;t ancient stories&mdash;they are your autobiography in symbols.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Miracle Has Already Begun</strong></h3>
<p>So the next time you read of some astonishing event in Scripture, ask yourself: <em>What is this showing me about imagination?</em> You may find that the miracle has already begun.</p>
