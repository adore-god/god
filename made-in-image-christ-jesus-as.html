<h1>THE MYSTERY </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p><strong>Consider:</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>“Let <b>US</b> make man in <b>OUR</b> image…” — <em>Genesis 1:26</em> </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>
“The love of God (I AM) in Christ Jesus our Lord (Imagination).” — <em>Romans 8:39</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not a secular record of past events, but a spiritual manual—a symbolic drama playing out in the consciousness of every individual. In that light, the creation of man, the nature of <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a>, and the working of salvation all speak to the same creative mechanism: the union of awareness and imagination.</p><p>This inner dynamic is the true “US” by which man is made in <a href="elohim-god.html">God’s</a> image.</p><hr><h3><strong>The “US” in Genesis: The Elohim and the Seed Principle</strong></h3><p>When Genesis 1:26 says, <em>“Let US make man in OUR image,”</em> it is speaking through the word <em>Elohim</em>—a plural title for <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> that suggests a composite unity of powers. <a href="elohim-god.html">Elohim</a> is often translated as “God,” but it implies more than a singular being: it carries the weight of <strong>rulers, judges, and authorities</strong>—the executive powers that determine what becomes law in the inner world.</p><p>Neville’s interpretation sees this “US” not just as a divine council, but as <strong>the inner faculties that govern mental creation</strong>. This includes the imagination, the senses, memory, judgment—those mental “rulers” that together decree what is assumed as true. These are the divine powers at work within you, deciding what you reproduce.</p><p>But “in Our image” also reflects an earlier <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">law of creation</a> in Genesis 1:11:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The earth brought forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In other words, everything produces after its own kind. <a href="genesis-126-man.html">Man</a> is no exception.<br>
To be made in the image of God (Elohim) is to function like Elohim: <strong>you bring forth according to the <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a> you carry within</strong>—your assumptions, your accepted self-concept, your felt inner state.</p><p>Thus, “Let US <a href="genesis-126-man.html">make man</a>” means: <strong>Let this spiritual structure—this divine, mental system—bring forth a being who also contains the power to create through inner agreement.</strong> You, like the fruit tree, carry the seed within. You reproduce it, inevitably.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Love of God in Christ Jesus: Function, Not Sentiment</strong></h3><p>This same spiritual process is mirrored in Paul’s words:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The love of God (I AM) in Christ Jesus our Lord (Imagination).”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>For Neville, this “love” is not emotional affection—it is <strong>functional fusion</strong>. The “love of God” is the moment your awareness of being (<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>) unites with the state you choose to dwell in (Christ). It’s a psychological marriage.</p><p>Each time you say <em>“<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> [a new state],”</em> and feel it as true, you are loving God in Christ Jesus. You are allowing the inner Elohim—the divine powers within—to bring forth according to the seed you now carry.</p><hr><h3><strong>Why Christ Jesus Equals Imagination</strong></h3><p>Neville radically redefined Christ Jesus—not as a figure in history, but as a living pattern within you: the redemptive power of imagination.</p><h4>1. <strong>Christ Is God’s Power and Wisdom in You</strong></h4><blockquote>
<p><em>“Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.”</em> — <em>1 Corinthians 1:24</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This “power” is your imagination. When you assume a new identity and persist in it, you are using Christ, the power of God, within.</p><h4>2. <strong>Jesus Christ Is the Pattern of Redemption</strong></h4><blockquote>
<p>“Jesus means salvation—liberation from limitation.”<br>
“Christ means the anointed—the awakened creative force.”</p>
</blockquote><p><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ Jesus</a> is imagination in action: redeeming you from your old state by embodying a new one.</p><h4>3. <strong>Christ Must Be Revealed in You</strong></h4><blockquote>
<p><em>“When it pleased God… to reveal His Son in me…”</em> — <em>Galatians 1:16</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Not <em>to</em> Paul—but <em>in</em> him. Christ is revealed within you as the creative power you’ve always had.</p><h4>4. <strong>Assumption Is the Act of Redemption</strong></h4><blockquote>
<p><em>“Let Us make man in Our image.”</em> — <em>Genesis 1:26</em><br>
<em>“The love of God in Christ Jesus.”</em> — <em>Romans 8:39</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Both describe the same mystery: <strong>you are made by what you assume to be true</strong>.<br>
You create each time you allow a new inner state to define you.<br>
Your awareness (God) and your imaginative act (Christ) join together to produce a new image of self—just as Genesis 1:11 describes all life reproducing according to its inner nature.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Imagination is the only redemptive power in the universe.”</em><br>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><hr><h3><strong>In Summary</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>God</strong> = I AM, your awareness of being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Christ Jesus</strong> = Imagination, the redemptive creative force</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elohim (God)</strong> = A unity of mental powers: the inner rulers and judges that create reality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The “Us” in Genesis</strong> = The full spiritual mechanism by which assumption becomes experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creation</strong> = Manifesting your assumptions, the seed within reproducing its kind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The love of God in Christ Jesus</strong> = Fusion of awareness and inner state (I AM + assumption)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>You are not here to worship imagination—you are here to <strong>awaken it</strong>. You are not made once—you are made anew every time you say <em>“I AM”</em> and believe it.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Let Us make man in Our image.”<br>
And so you do—every time the seed within you matches the life you live.</p></blockquote><p class="label-links"><a href="label-architecture-series.html" class="noTag">Architecture Series</a> | <a href="label-exodus-3-14--i-am.html" class="noTag">Exodus 3:14: I AM</a> | <a href="label-genesis-1-26-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 1:26 Series</a> | <a href="label-jesus-christ--salvation.html" class="noTag">Jesus Christ: SALVATION</a> | <a href="label-paul-s-letters--romans.html" class="noTag">Paul's Letters: Romans</a></p>
