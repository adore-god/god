<h1>The Word of God, the Seed, and the Law</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>According to Neville Goddard, the Bible is not a historical document but a symbolic revelation of how consciousness operates. It maps the inner structure of <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">creation</a> — not the beginning of the universe, but the <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">beginning of every experience</a>.</p><p>When read in this way, three verses from different parts of the Bible form a powerful sequence of insight. Though they appear in different places, we look at them thematically — because this is how the inner process of manifestation unfolds:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>John 1:1</strong> reveals the origin of all creation — the “Word,” which Neville defines as an assumption or idea held in imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 11:1</strong> shows the power of inner unity and introduces the shift from the <a href="divided-by-doctrine-confusion-of.html">language of external effort to that of inner assumption.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 1:11</strong> presents the law in action — the <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed within brings forth</a> after its kind.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This symbolic sequence reflects the movement of imagination from conception, to agreement, to expression.</p><hr><h2>John 1:1 — In the Beginning Was the Word</h2><blockquote>
<p>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville interprets the Word as imagination — the divine creative faculty within every individual. This “Word” is not a sound but a conscious assumption. The Word is both with God and is God because God, in Neville’s teachings, is your own wonderful human imagination. The name <a href="elohim-god.html">Elohim - God</a> - symbolises the manifold aspects of your own consciousness that imaginatively convene within the mind.</p><p>Importantly, this first “Word” is echoed in Genesis: <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">the first Word of God was the first assumption, the first movement of consciousness spoken into existence</a> “in the beginning.” It was not an external command but an inner declaration — the original “I AM.”</p><p>Every beginning starts here: with a Word, a belief, an idea you hold to be true. This is the first cause, the unseen root of what will become visible.</p><hr><h2>Genesis 11:1 — The Shift to the Language of Assumption</h2><blockquote>
<p>“And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This verse appears just before the story of the <a href="divided-by-doctrine-confusion-of.html">Tower of Babel</a>. Traditionally, it is seen as a literal account of humanity's shared language before it was divided. Symbolically, however, it points to a state of internal harmony where thought and feeling align.</p><p>Through Neville’s understanding, this verse also marks a pivotal shift: from a <a href="divided-by-doctrine-confusion-of.html">language of external striving and effort to the language of inner assumption</a>. The "one language" represents the unified inner state in which belief (thought) and emotional conviction (speech) are fully merged.</p><p>When your assumptions (the true “language” of the mind) and your feelings (“speech”) are one, you are in perfect inner agreement, making manifestation possible and inevitable.</p><p>The <a href="divided-by-doctrine-confusion-of.html">Tower of Babel story</a> symbolises the insertion of the new premise of the law of Assumption, where imagination governs reality from within.</p><hr><h2>Genesis 1:11 — The Seed Is in Itself</h2><blockquote>
<p>“And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself...”</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville saw this as a symbolic truth, not an agricultural one. The “earth” is the subconscious, and <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">the “seed” is the assumption you plant within</a> it. The key is this: the seed is in itself. Your assumptions contain within them the pattern of their own expression. They will bring forth “after their kind.”</p><p>There is no need to look outside for causes. Everything in your outer world is fruit bearing witness to what has been sown within.</p><hr><h2>A Hidden Blueprint of Creation</h2><p>These verses, arranged according to Neville’s framework, reveal the full arc of manifestation:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>You conceive: In the beginning is the Word — the first assumption held in imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You align: Thought and feeling become one language and one speech — the language of inner assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You bring forth: The earth (your subconscious) yields fruit after its kind.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Bible, seen in this light, is not warning you to obey outer commandments — it is showing you how to command reality from within.</p><hr><h2>The Silent Command</h2><p>When you see that the first Word of God is not an external sound but the first movement of your own awareness — the first assumption — the entire Bible transforms. It becomes not a record of outer commandments but a guide for commanding reality from within.</p><p>Your “beginning” is always now. Your “Word” is the assumption you choose to speak silently within yourself.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-elohim--god-series.html" class="noTag">Elohim: God Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-genesis-1-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 1 Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-genesis-1-11-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 1:11 Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-john-series.html" class="noTag">John Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-tower-of-babel-series.html" class="noTag">Tower of Babel Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-word-of-god-series.html" class="noTag">Word of God Series</a></p>
