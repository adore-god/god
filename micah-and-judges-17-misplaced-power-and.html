<h1>Micah, His Mother and His Shrine: Judges 17</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<blockquote>
<p><em>“In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.”</em><br>
— Judges 17:6</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judges 17 depicts a soul at the beginning of self judgement and awakening. Each character represents a mental posture or inner condition.  This chapter plays on "who?" Vs "I AM", and illustrates how awareness alone is not enough—knowledge must be consciously assumed and aligned with principle to produce true inner authority.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Micah: The Emerging Consciousness</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“There was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.”</em><br>
— Judges 17:1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Micah’s name means “Who is like God?”—the part of you that begins to question and seek. He represents the reflecting mind curious about the law of Assumption but not yet fully claiming mental authority. He looks outward for validation, showing how unassumed knowledge allows energy to flow into appearances rather than principle.</p>

<p>Micah and Michael share the same meaning—“Who is like God?”—but psychologically they represent different states of consciousness. Micah embodies the questioning, seeking part of the self, aware of the power but not yet claiming it. He is still exploring, still externalising. Michael, by contrast, represents the assumed consciousness—the one who has claimed the principle of inner authority. Where Micah asks, Michael acts. This distinction shows that awareness alone is not enough; it must be consciously assumed to become living power, aligning with Neville Goddard’s teaching of “I AM that I AM, vs Who?!”</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Micah’s Mother: The Beliefs Still Holding Him</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He said unto his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels of silver… I took it.”</em><br>
— Judges 17:2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Micah’s mother represents the inherited patterns, beliefs, and assumptions that continue to hold influence over him—the “father and mother” referenced in <a class="noTag" href="genesis-224-love.html">Genesis 2:24</a>. These are the old energies and habits that are meant to be left behind when uniting with a new state of consciousness. The fact that Micah still needs to confess and return the silver shows he has not yet fully broken free; he remains under the sway of these old patterns. The 1,100 shekels of silver represent the full potential of knowledge or awareness, <a class="noTag" href="genesis-111-seed.html">akin to the “seed in itself” in Genesis 1:11</a>: complete, self-contained, and capable of producing all that is contained within it, but only when consciously planted in the chosen state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“…and she said, ‘Blessed be thou of the Lord, my son.’”</em><br>
— Judges 17:2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her blessing comes only after Micah confesses and returns the silver. Before this, her curse over the missing silver symbolises the tension and resistance experienced when knowledge is misdirected or applied without conscious alignment. Psychologically, it reflects how inherited patterns can continue to exert pressure, keeping the individual from fully claiming inner authority.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“…to make a graven image.”</em><br>
— Judges 17:3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The creation of the idol demonstrates how misused knowledge is projected outward. Until you <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">deliberately assume your chosen state</a>, your awareness remains partially held by old patterns, feeding outward forms, rituals, or unexamined beliefs rather than principle itself. This mirrors <em>Genesis 2:23</em>, where recognition of the true counterpart signifies alignment with the correct principle or state of being.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Silver: Knowledge and Awareness of Power</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Silver</strong> = knowledge or awareness of your power</li>
<li><strong>Misused silver</strong> = knowledge applied to outward appearances or unexamined beliefs</li>
<li><strong>Returned and properly used silver</strong> = consciously assumed knowledge leading to inner authority</li>
</ul>

<p>When silver (knowledge) is misdirected into old beliefs or external forms, the inner authority remains weakened and partially held back. Only when consciously assumed and correctly applied does it restore alignment and crown the chosen state of consciousness as king. The 1,100 pieces of silver illustrate the complete potential within awareness itself—like the seed in itself—ready to manifest fully when consciously applied rather than scattered or misdirected.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Levite and Idol: Externalised Authority</strong></h2>

<p>Micah appoints a Levite and builds a shrine, creating external forms of worship. This illustrates reliance on credentials, rituals, or borrowed authority instead of consciously assuming one’s own inner power. The Levite represents knowledge without embodiment, while the idol represents the misapplied knowledge that continues to hold sway outside the self, reinforcing old patterns.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Principle versus Appearance</strong></h2>

<p>Judges 17 illustrates the law of assumption: true power lies not in rituals, objects, or inherited beliefs, but in assumed principle. Until the old beliefs (the mother and father) are fully left behind and the chosen state is consciously assumed (<em>Genesis 2:24</em>), knowledge remains partially controlled by inherited patterns, and no “king” rules over consciousness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Psychological Summary</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Micah</strong>: Awakening consciousness asking, <em>Who is like God?</em>, still partially held by inherited patterns</li>
<li><strong>Michael</strong>: Fully assumed consciousness, acting in authority</li>
<li><strong>Mother / Father</strong>: Beliefs or assumptions still influencing the individual (<em>Genesis 2:24</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Mother’s curse over missing silver</strong>: Tension and resistance when knowledge is misdirected</li>
<li><strong>Silver</strong>: Knowledge or awareness of inner power</li>
<li><strong>Misused silver</strong>: Knowledge applied to outward appearances or unexamined beliefs</li>
<li><strong>Returned silver</strong>: Consciously assumed knowledge, producing inner authority</li>
<li><strong>1,100 silver pieces</strong>: Complete potential of knowledge, like the seed in itself (<em>Genesis 1:11</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Idol</strong>: Outward forms receiving energy meant for inner principle</li>
<li><strong>Levite</strong>: Knowledge without lived assumption</li>
<li><strong>No king</strong>: No consciously assumed state of being</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Conclusion: Leaving the Old to Assume the New</strong></h2>

<p>Judges 17 symbolises the process of leaving behind inherited beliefs and misapplied knowledge to assume a chosen state of being. The mother’s curse reflects the tension experienced when old patterns continue to exert influence. Silver represents your knowledge and awareness of power; misused, it strengthens outward forms and unexamined beliefs. When returned and consciously assumed, it produces inner authority. Until these old patterns are fully released, as described in <em>Genesis 2:23-24</em>, the chosen state cannot be fully crowned “king,” and part of the individual’s energy remains held by the old, limiting the flow of imagination as God. The 1,100 pieces of silver remind us that all potential for manifestation is already contained within awareness itself, like the seed in itself, waiting to be consciously assumed and fully brought to life.</p>

<h2><strong>After Micah: The Spread of Misapplied Knowledge</strong></h2>

<p>Judges 18 picks up where Micah’s story leaves off. The Danites, searching for territory, come across Micah’s shrine and Levite. They steal the silver, the idol, and convince the Levite to serve them. Psychologically, this shows what happens when knowledge and creative power are not consciously assumed—they can be taken or influenced by outer conditions, rather than serving your chosen state of consciousness.</p>

<p>The story demonstrates several key principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Misapplied awareness spreads:</strong> Knowledge or power not consciously assumed can influence others or be co-opted, creating fragmented states of consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>External reliance creates instability:</strong> The Levite and idol symbolize knowledge and authority projected outward. Without conscious assumption, power is dependent on conditions outside yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Leaving the old behind is crucial:</strong> Until one fully abandons inherited beliefs (the mother and father), energy remains scattered and susceptible to misdirection.</li>
<li><strong>Assumption is king:</strong> The story underlines Neville’s principle: only consciously assumed states—your chosen identity—can centralize power and align awareness properly.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, Judges 18 is the consequence of not leaving behind the old beliefs in Judges 17. Misused silver (knowledge) is now influencing a larger collective, demonstrating that inner power must be consciously assumed to prevent external chaos and misalignment.</p>
