<h1>Zechariah: Passage Analysis 14:6–9</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The prophet Zechariah’s words are rich in symbolism and, when viewed through Neville Goddard’s teachings, describe the inner journey of <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assuming a new state of being</a> — the rebirth of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>. Let’s explore this passage verse by verse.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Zechariah 14:6: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark.”</strong></p>
<p>This is the moment of transition — when you have released the old belief but haven’t fully stabilised in the new one. You’ve assumed the feeling of the wish fulfilled, but reality hasn’t yet conformed. In Neville’s terms, you are in a psychological twilight. You are not in your old state, but neither is the new one fully visible. The outer world appears uncertain because your inner world is rearranging.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Zechariah 14:7: “But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.”</strong></p>
<p>This “one day” is not a calendar day, but the eternal now — the moment you assume your desire is already fulfilled. The Lord here symbolises your I AM, your awareness of being. Though your senses tell you it’s night, it is actually light — illumination comes when you persist in your assumption, even when appearances contradict you. Neville says: <em>“Dare to believe in the reality of your assumption and watch the world play its part relative to its fulfillment.”</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Zechariah 14:8: “And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.”</strong></p>
<p>From Jerusalem — symbol of the assumed, awakened state — flows “living waters,” or the life-giving power of imagination. This creative flow moves toward both the past (former sea) and future (hinder sea), showing us that assumption doesn’t just impact what’s to come — it can revise the past. Neville famously taught revision as a tool of transformation. And these waters flow in all seasons, for imagination is always active, always generative, no matter the outer condition.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Zechariah 14:9: “And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.”</strong></p>
<p>When you persist in the assumption, you reach dominion. The Lord — your I AM awareness — becomes ruler over all your world. There is no longer confusion or division within; you are not torn between states. You have become the one you’ve chosen to be, and everything in your experience reflects that. The name is one because the identity is single, focused, and consistent.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
