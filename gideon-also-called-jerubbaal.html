<h1>Gideon — Feeding the Mind</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">
<blockquote>Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it, The LORD Is Peace.  — Judges 6:24</blockquote>

<p>Gideon’s story is a careful teaching on <strong>feeding the mind and manifesting through imagination</strong>. Each act, command, and test is symbolic of how consciousness receives, enriches, and expresses ideas.</p>

<hr><h3>The Rock and the Offering</h3>
<p>When Gideon places meat and unleavened cakes on the rock and pours broth over them (Judges 6:19–21), it is a lesson in inner receptivity. The <strong>rock</strong> is <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">the skull, the inner altar of the mind</a>. The <strong>meat and cakes</strong> symbolize imagination and desire; the <strong>broth</strong> represents feeling, which nourishes and animates the idea. When fire rises from the rock to consume the offering, the mind has fully accepted the idea — <a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagination</a> has digested and made it alive, ready to manifest outwardly.</p>

<hr><h3>Destroying Old Beliefs</h3>
<p>The command to tear down Baal’s altar (Judges 6:25–27) illustrates the rejection of old beliefs and conditions that falsely claim authority over perception. Constructing a new altar signifies preparing the mind to receive ideas consciously, free from distraction, so the inner imagination can take control.</p>

<hr><h3>Meeting the Lord Face to Face</h3>
<p>When Gideon encounters the Lord “face to face,” it marks the moment of <strong>direct consciousness of creative power</strong>. Psychologically, this is when the mind recognises its own ability to shape reality. <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Fear, doubt, and outer appearances</a> are set aside, and the unseen, imaginative self becomes the guiding authority. This internal clarity precedes effective manifestation.</p>

<hr><h3>The Altar Called “The Lord Is Peace”</h3>
<p>Gideon names the new altar <strong>Jehovah Shalom</strong> — “The Lord is Peace” (Judges 6:24). The altar represents the inner place where ideas are offered and consumed. By declaring it <a href="peace-and-rest-in-song-of-solomon.html">“Peace,” the mind rests in certainty and calm</a>, knowing that imagination alone governs the outcome. It is a state of confidence where the inner “chef” and the inner “consumer” are aligned, and ideas can safely take root in consciousness.</p>

<hr><h3>Testing Conviction with the Fleece</h3>
<p>The fleece (Judges 6:36–40) is a tool for confirming inner conviction. The dew condensing on the fleece shows that belief alone governs perception. Conscious imagination is the unseen ruler of circumstances, and testing the mind’s receptivity reinforces faith in its unseen power.</p>

<hr><h3>Choosing the Mindful</h3>
<p>The selection of three hundred soldiers (Judges 7:1–7) demonstrates the principle of <strong>intentional consumption of thought and feeling</strong>. Those who lift water deliberately represent consciousness that consciously nourishes ideas, essential for manifestation. The unmindful or distracted cannot carry the idea into expression.</p>

<hr><h3>The Power of Simple Images</h3>
<p>The Midianite dream of the barley cake (Judges 7:13–14) shows that even humble images, when fully embraced by the imagination, can overcome vast obstacles. Conscious focus and feeling amplify the smallest idea into potent creative power.</p>

<hr><h3>The Name Change: Gideon to Jerubbaal</h3>
<p>Finally, Gideon’s new name, <strong>Jerubbaal</strong> — “Let Baal contend” (Judges 6:32) — signals the withdrawal of allegiance from appearances and old beliefs. Like Abraham, Sarah, and Jacob, the name change marks the point where consciousness steps fully into the new creative state, trusting imagination to govern reality. The mind is now both altar and flame, feeding ideas until they manifest.</p>

<hr><h3>Conclusion: Feeding the Mind as Manifestation</h3>
<p>Gideon’s narrative provides a comprehensive psychological blueprint for manifestation. It teaches how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present ideas clearly and richly to consciousness</li>
<li>Infuse them with feeling so they are fully accepted</li>
<li>Reject limiting beliefs that block imagination</li>
<li>Confirm inner conviction through testing and observation</li>
<li>Rest in inner peace, confident that imagination governs outer events</li>
</ul>
<p>Through offerings on the rock, destroying Baal’s altar, meeting the Lord, naming the altar, testing the fleece, selecting the mindful, and observing dreams, Gideon shows how to consciously feed the mind until your desires take root and bear fruit in reality.</p>
