<img alt="Imagining Mind Icon The Way" src="images/wp/head-imagining.webp" style="width:60%"/>

<p>I was brought up Christian, went to Sunday school and youth club, but never really took to the doctrine. The way it was taught always felt distant — full of old language, guilt, and outer rituals that didn’t connect with anything real inside me.</p>

<p>Looking back, the traditional Christian perception of the Bible caused me a lot of confusion growing up and even into my adult life. There was so much guilt and pressure to live by rules that never seemed to reach the heart of what was being taught. It left me with the idea that God was something to fear rather than something to understand — and that never sat right with me.</p>

<p>I believed there had to be more to it than what I was hearing.</p>

<p>When manifestation started becoming popular, I got interested. But what really caught my attention was realising that everything people were teaching — the Law of Assumption, imagination creating reality, living from the end — all came from the Bible. That surprised me. So I decided to look at the Bible again for myself, without the religious filters, to see if it actually held up.</p>

<p>It was particularly hard to change the point of view I was reading from. For so long I’d been taught to see the Bible through the lens of religion and history that it felt unnatural to approach it any other way. But the more I read, and the more I started piecing things together, the more the Bible began to open up.</p>

<p>Just the fact that I had to change my perspective to see it differently showed me how deeply belief shapes perception. What you believe in — or what you’ve been constantly told to believe — determines what you’re even capable of seeing.</p>

<p>And it does hold up.</p>

<p>When you strip away the tradition and take it as a psychological book, it becomes clear that the Bible isn’t about ancient people or historical events at all. It’s about states of consciousness — the inner movements of the mind. Every story describes the process of imagining, believing, and becoming.</p>

<p>It’s not about worshipping an external God but discovering that God is your own awareness — the creative power within you that becomes whatever you assume to be true.</p>

<p>That’s what <strong>The Way</strong> is about.</p>

<p>This site is for anyone who’s ever questioned the old interpretations, who’s sensed that the Bible is really about something happening inside them. I share what I’ve found through studying Neville Goddard’s work and reading Scripture as a symbolic record of human imagination — a guide to creating consciously and living as “I AM.”</p>

<p>If you’ve ever felt there was truth in the Bible but couldn’t accept the way it’s been presented, you’re not wrong. There is truth in it — and it’s far more alive, practical, and personal than most people realise.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to The Way.</strong></p>
