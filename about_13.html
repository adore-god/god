<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>Explore <a href="https://god.thway.uk/only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard’s</a> teachings in a structured and accessible way, with direct references to the Bible, which itself reveals the Law of Assumption through its stories and symbolism.</p>
<p>When Neville spoke in his lectures, he always taught alongside the Bible because he was revealing what it had already shown—its psychological principles and processes. Today, many fail to recognise that the Bible is not just a reference but the very revelation Neville was making accessible.</p>
<h3>Practical notes</h3>
<p>Clicking on Bible verse references within posts will open a pop-up showing the actual Bible passage from Blue Letter Bible. Hebrew name meanings can be found using tool apps like <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/">Blue Letter Bible</a>, which also provide many translations and interlinear insights.</p>
<h2>About The Writer</h2>
<p>I was brought up Christian, went to Sunday school and youth club, but never really took to the doctrine. The way it was taught always felt distant — full of old language, guilt, and outer rituals that didn’t connect with anything real inside me. I believed there had to be more to it than what I was hearing.</p>
<p>The traditional Christian perception of the Bible caused a lot of confusion for me growing up and even into my adult life. The constant guilt-tripping, the rules, and the idea of a judging God made it hard to find any real comfort or truth in it. It often felt as though I was being kept small — afraid of disappointing something outside myself rather than discovering the power that was already within.</p>
<p>When manifestation started becoming popular, I got interested. But what really caught my attention was realising that everything people were teaching — the Law of Assumption, imagination creating reality, living from the end — all came from the Bible. That surprised me. Someone had obviously written those stories with a cohesive narrative.
So I decided to read the Bible for myself again, without any religious filters, interpreting it solely through the text and <a href="only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville's framework</a>, to see if it truly held up.</p>
<p>And it does.</p>
<p>I wasn’t struggling with the text itself, but with my perspective. We are so accustomed to believing in the external world that seeing differently takes effort. At first, I kept reading outwardly, as I had always done. Gradually, it began to reveal itself inwardly, showing how profoundly belief shapes perception. This, I realised, is likely why the full meaning of the Bible often gets overlooked. I also noticed that it repeats the same patterns over and over again and is far more expansive than people realise.</p>
<p>When you strip away the tradition and take it as a psychological book, it becomes clear that the Bible isn’t about ancient people or historical events at all. It’s about states of consciousness — the inner movements of the mind. Every story describes the process of imagining, believing, and becoming.</p>
<p>It’s not about worshipping an external God but discovering that God is your own awareness — the ability within you to become whatever you assume to be true.</p>
<p>That’s what <strong>The Way</strong> is about.</p>
<p>This site is for anyone who’s ever questioned the old interpretations, who’s sensed that the Bible is really about something more. I share what I’ve found through studying <a href="only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard’s</a> work and reading Scripture as a symbolic record of human imagination — a guide to assuming consciously and living as <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM that I AM.”</a></p>
<p>What amazes me most is how this book — written thousands of years ago — contains such timeless, intimate wisdom about the human mind and creative power. It’s astonishing that something so profound has been preserved for millennia, yet so often overlooked or misunderstood. In its universal language of symbolic imagery lies a living, breathing message about the nature of consciousness itself — something deeply personal, endlessly revealing, and always new</p>
<p>If you’ve ever felt there was truth in the Bible but couldn’t accept the way it’s been presented, you’re not wrong. There is truth in it — and it’s far more alive, practical, and personal than most people realise.</p>
