    <h1>Crossing the Jordan: The Symbolism of the Twelve Stones and the Law of Assumption</h1>
    <p>In the Book of Joshua, we read of a powerful moment where the Israelites finally cross the Jordan River into the Promised Land. But before moving on, Joshua is instructed to do something curious—he gathers twelve stones from the riverbed and sets them up as a memorial. For many, this is simply a moment of historical remembrance. But when read through the spiritual insight of Neville Goddard’s teachings, this episode becomes a profound allegory for transformation through assumption.</p>
<h3><strong>The Jordan: A Threshold in Consciousness</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville’s framework, the Bible is not a record of external events but a psychological drama playing out within us. The Jordan River symbolises the invisible boundary between our current state and the desired one—the place of decision, faith, and transformation.</p>
<p>To cross the Jordan is to leave behind the wilderness of doubt and move decisively into the assumption of your fulfilled desire. It is the moment you say inwardly: <em>I am now that which I formerly sought to become.</em></p>
<h3><strong>The Twelve Stones: Anchoring the New Identity</strong></h3>
<p>After crossing, Joshua commands one man from each of the twelve tribes to take a stone from the middle of the river—the very place their feet stood firm as the waters were held back—and carry it to the shore. These stones are then set up as a permanent memorial.</p>
<p>Through Neville’s eyes, these stones represent <strong>solidified assumptions</strong>—the conscious choices we make to inhabit a new identity. Each stone is like a fixed thought or feeling that supports the state we have entered. Just as the Israelites are told to look at the stones and remember what was accomplished, so too are we to remind ourselves of the inner shift we have made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Man must persist in the new assumption, and not return to the former state simply because the outer world hasn’t yet rearranged itself."</em> — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stones do not mark the beginning of the journey, but the crossing—<strong>the internal victory</strong> over fear, indecision, and identification with the old self.</p>
<h3><strong>Memorials in the Mind</strong></h3>
<p>Neville often spoke of the importance of remaining loyal to the end, of dwelling in the state until it feels natural. The twelve stones are mental anchors—<strong>reminders that you have already crossed</strong>, already claimed your desire in imagination.</p>
<p>When circumstances tempt you to doubt or revert, you recall the stones. You remind yourself: <em>I have already assumed it. I have crossed over. This is who I am now.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p>This biblical story is not merely about a nation entering a land—it is about <strong>you</strong> entering a new state of being. The Jordan is the psychological threshold. The stones are your daily affirmations, feelings, and beliefs that support the new identity.</p>
<p>You do not need to see physical results to know you've crossed. Like the Israelites stepping onto dry ground before the waters returned, your assumption makes the way—even when the world has yet to catch up.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-object-symbolism.html">Object Symbolism</a></p>
