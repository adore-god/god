<h1>Psalm 103: Passage Analysis</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p></p><blockquote><p>Give praise to the Lord, O my soul; let everything in me give praise to his holy name.</p><p>
Give praise to the Lord, O my soul; let not all his blessings go from your memory.</p><p>
He has forgiveness for all your sins; he takes away all your diseases;<br>
He keeps back your life from destruction, crowning you with mercy and grace.</p><p>
He makes your mouth full of good things, so that your strength is made new again like the eagle's.</p><p>
The Lord gives decisions in righteousness for all who are in trouble.</p><p>
He gave knowledge of his way to Moses, and made his acts clear to the children of Israel.</p><p>
The Lord is kind and full of pity, not quickly made angry, but ever ready to have mercy.</p><p>
His feeling will no longer be bitter; he will not keep his wrath for ever.</p><p>
His punishment has not been on us in answer to our sins; and he has not given us the reward of our wrongdoing.<br>
For as the heaven is high over the earth, so great is his mercy to his worshippers.</p><p>
As far as the east is from the west, so far has he put our sins from us.</p><p>
As a father has pity on his children, so the Lord has pity on his worshippers.<br>
For he has knowledge of our feeble frame; he sees that we are only dust.</p><p>
As for man, his days are as grass: his beautiful growth is like the flower of the field.</p><p>
The wind goes over it and it is gone; and its place sees it no longer.</p><p>
But the mercy of the Lord is eternal for his worshippers, and their children's children will see his righteousness;</p><p>
If they keep his agreement, and have his laws in mind to do them.</p><p>
The Lord has made ready his high seat in the heavens; his kingdom is ruling over all.</p><p>
Give praise to the Lord, you his angels of great strength, doing his word, listening to the voice of his saying.</p><p>
Give praise to the Lord, all you his armies; you servants of his, doing his pleasure.</p><p>
Give praise to the Lord, all the works of his hands, in every place of his rule: Give praise to the Lord, O my soul.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<h2><strong>A Neville Goddard Interpretation: Inner Praise and Transformation</strong></h2>
<p>This psalm is more than poetry. It’s a call to awaken your deeper self. Through the teachings of Neville Goddard, we can read Psalm 103 not as external praise to a distant deity, but as the <strong>inner dialogue of the soul</strong>—a stirring of the subconscious into remembrance and realignment with divine truth.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>The Inner Call to Praise</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Give praise to the Lord, O my soul; let everything in me give praise to his holy name."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not external worship but <strong>a command to the feeling self</strong>—the subconscious. The “holy name” is <strong>I AM</strong>. Every part of you is called to enter into agreement with this truth. Praise here is not flattery—it is conscious union.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Memory as Alignment</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Let not all his blessings go from your memory."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Neville’s terms, <strong>memory determines your state</strong>. When you remember what is already true of your divine nature, you no longer strive—you assume. Forgetfulness of blessings means slipping into a lower state; remembrance is how you rise.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Forgiveness and Healing as Shifting States</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"He has forgiveness for all your sins; he takes away all your diseases."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sin is simply <strong>missing the mark</strong>—living from an old, limited state. Forgiveness means you no longer identify with that state. Once you drop the mistaken identity, your world (and body) realigns.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Crowned with Grace</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Crowning you with mercy and grace."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the <strong>self crowned with a new assumption</strong>. Grace and mercy symbolise a higher self-concept—one that is no longer ruled by guilt or delay, but by acceptance of divine inheritance.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Renewed Like the Eagle</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Your strength is made new again like the eagle's."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The eagle represents <strong>vision, height, and spiritual authority</strong>. When you speak from praise, your vitality is renewed—not because the outer changed, but because your <strong>assumption</strong> lifted you to new heights.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>A Measureless Mercy</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"As far as the east is from the west, so far has he put our sins from us."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This line pictures <strong>complete separation</strong> from the old state. The former self—full of doubt, fear, or shame—is not clung to. The inner shift has occurred. The new man has taken its place.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Dust and Spirit</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"He sees that we are only dust."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a judgement—it’s a <strong>reminder of the outer man’s frailty</strong>. Dust is form, but spirit is power. We are to stop identifying with the fragile outer and start living from the eternal I AM within.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Praise Activates the Whole</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Give praise to the Lord, all the works of his hands..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Neville’s language, <strong>consciousness is the only reality</strong>. Every aspect of creation is tied to your state. Praise—conscious, grateful assumption—realigns all things. Your world reflects what you truly honour within.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: The Subconscious Must Be Stirred</strong></h2>
<p>Psalm 103 reminds us that transformation comes not from pleading, but from <strong>assumed praise</strong>—a living inner conviction that “all his benefits” are now yours. This is the essence of Neville Goddard’s message: <strong>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, and you will see its reflection in your world</strong>.</p>
