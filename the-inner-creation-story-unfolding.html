<h1>Genesis 1: CREATION</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The first chapter of Genesis is not a literal account of external creation. It is a dream-like, pictorial revelation of how states of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> unfold from the deep of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagination</a> into visible life. According to Neville Goddard, each “day” describes a step in the movement from formless awareness <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">(“I AM”)</a> to the full embodiment of a chosen state. It is pure imaginative assumption, described in the language of water, earth, light, and <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a> — the soft symbols of inner vision. </p><hr/><h3>Day One: Let There Be Light</h3><p><strong>Symbol: Awareness of “I AM”</strong></p><p>In the beginning, the mind is like deep, unbroken water — dark, undefined, waiting. Then arises the first silent glimmer: <em><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></em>. This is the light, not yet “I AM this or that,” but the <a href="elohim-god.html">pure awareness of being</a>. It is the gentle division between unconscious drifting and conscious awakening.</p><p>This “light” is a symbolic picture of the moment when you first sense your own existence — the initial dream-flash of self-awareness.</p><hr/><h3>Day Two: The Firmament</h3><p><strong>Symbol: Separation of inner assumption from outer reflection</strong></p><p>The firmament is pictured as a great arch dividing the waters above from the waters below. In this symbolic dream-language, it marks the recognition that imagination (above) is separate from facts (below).</p><p>Neville taught that your inner conversations, feelings, and assumptions — the higher waters — shape the visible world beneath. The firmament is the quiet realisation that what you accept and dwell on within must one day echo outward as experience.</p><hr/><h3>Day Three: Dry Land and Seed Within Itself</h3><p><strong>Symbol: Solid state of assumption and the self-contained seed</strong></p><p>As the waters gather, dry land emerges, and with it, the command for every plant to bear <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed “within itself.”</a></p><p>This land is the stable ground of your chosen state, rising from the shifting emotional sea. The seed within itself is a vivid symbol in this dream-like narrative: every assumption you accept contains the entire pattern of its future expression.</p><p>Neville taught that imagining from the end — living as though your <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">wish were already fulfilled</a> — plants this seed in consciousness. Just as a tiny acorn holds a mighty oak, your inner act holds all the unfolding details already complete.</p><p>Dry land becomes <a href="label-rock-series.html">rock metaphor</a> throughout the narrative.</p><hr/><h3>Day Four: Sun and Moon</h3><p><strong>Symbol: Imagination as the guiding light, assumption as reflected faith</strong></p><p>The two great lights are set in the sky: the sun to rule the day, the moon the night. In this pictorial language, the sun is <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">"I AM" — the masculine, directing light, the conscious awareness of being</a>, the man. The moon, reflecting this light, is <a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagination</a> — the receptive, shaping power, the <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a>, which takes the awareness of "I AM" and forms it into images and states.</p><hr/><h3>Day Five: Life in Water and Air</h3><p><strong>Symbol: Emotional movement and expansion of inner life</strong></p><p>From the <a href="label-water-symbolism.html">seas rise fish</a>, and in the skies, birds take flight. These lively symbols depict the quickening of emotional conviction within imagination.</p><p>As Neville explained, feelings give life to assumptions. The birds and fish in this dream-like story represent assumptions moving freely, multiplying, and filling the inner world with living emotional reality. Each new feeling is a ripple that spreads, strengthening the chosen state.</p><hr/><h3>Day Six: Creatures and Man in God’s Image</h3><p><strong>Symbol: Full embodiment of the assumed state</strong></p><p>On the sixth day, living creatures appear on land, culminating<a href="genesis-126-man.html"> in man — made in the image of God</a>. In this symbolic drama, man represents the moment when the assumed state becomes fully embodied. You no longer just imagine it or think of it as possible; you <em>are</em> the state.</p><p>You take dominion, not over the outer world, but over your inner kingdom of states. Here, you step beyond hoping or trying; you claim identity as the creator of your world within.</p><hr/><h3>Day Seven: Rest — The Sabbath</h3><p><strong>Symbol: Inner stillness and certainty of fulfilment</strong></p><p>On the seventh day, <a href="peace-and-rest-in-song-of-solomon.html">God rests</a>. This Sabbath is not a physical rest but a psychological one — the serene certainty that the imaginal act is finished.</p><p>Neville described this rest as the sign of true faith: you no longer question, worry, or strain. You dwell in the assurance that what is accepted within must unfold without. This dream-like picture of rest symbolises perfect inner stillness, knowing the work is already complete.</p><hr/><h2>The Seven Movements of the First Assumption</h2><p>Through these seven symbolic "days," Genesis sketches the quiet inner journey of every assumption:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Awakening to “I AM.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separating inner cause from outer effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing the stable ground of the chosen state (seed within).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balancing imagination and assumption (sun and moon).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathing life into the state through feeling (fish and birds).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully embodying the state as your new identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resting in fulfilled conviction.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Every desire begins this silent cycle again. Every assumption is a new seed. Every “Let there be light” is a soft dawn within consciousness, carrying the dream-like promise of a new world.</p><p>As Neville said, <em>“Creation is finished. It is your acceptance of it that makes it real to you.</em></p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-genesis-1-series.html">Genesis 1 Series</a> | <a href="label-numbers-series.html">Numbers Series</a> | <a href="label-numbers--four.html">Numbers: Four</a> | <a href="label-numbers--seven.html">Numbers: Seven</a> | <a href="label-numbers--three.html">Numbers: Three</a></p>
