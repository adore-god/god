    <h1>Man in His Image: Streaming the Self </h1>
    <p></p><blockquote><em>"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..."</em><br/>
— <strong>Genesis 1:26</strong></blockquote><strong></strong><p></p><p>In today’s hyperconnected world, we live in a constant stream of visual noise pictures. Social media, video platforms, digital ads—they feed us image after image, moment after moment, until our minds are saturated. We have become passive recipients in a world built on distraction. But in the Bible, man was made <strong>in the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">image of God</a></strong>—and this is not a physical resemblance, but a functional one: the <strong>ability to imagine, to conceive, and to create</strong>.</p><p>Neville Goddard often taught that imagination is not a faculty we merely use—it is <strong>God in action</strong> within us. Genesis 1:26 reveals this foundational truth: to be made in God's image is to possess the <strong>creative power of consciousness</strong>. What God is on the cosmic scale, man is on the individual scale—a being capable of forming the unseen and making it seen.</p><p>The irony of our age is that while the <strong>mind was made to stream from within</strong>, we now let it stream <strong>only from without</strong>. Just like autoplaying videos and endless scrolls, thoughts run through our minds—but instead of being authored by us, they’re supplied by the world. We confuse <strong>consumption</strong> with <strong>creation</strong>. But there’s a crucial difference: one drains us, the other transforms us.</p><p>Neville often emphasised <strong>living in the end</strong>, which is the deliberate choice to dwell in the inner scene of fulfilled desire. This is not escapism, but <strong>the truest return to divine function</strong>. To imagine is to remember who you are: one made to reflect God’s image through conscious assumption, not merely react to stimuli.</p><p>So the next time you find yourself endlessly watching others’ lives, take a moment and ask—<strong>who’s directing the film within</strong>? Are you using your God-given capacity to imagine, or are you just letting the world write your script?</p><blockquote>
<p>The real power lies not in the stream of images we consume, but in the divine image we carry—and activate—within.</p></blockquote><p class="label-links"><a href="label-genesis-1-26-series.html">Genesis 1:26 Series</a> | <a href="label-social-and-cultural-commentary.html">Social and Cultural Commentary</a></p>
