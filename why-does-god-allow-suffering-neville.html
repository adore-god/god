<h1>Why Does God Allow Suffering? A Neville Goddard Perspective</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Neville Goddard points out that the Bible reveals that God is not external, and suffering is not something an external God imposes. It happens when our beliefs and assumptions are out of alignment with what we want. The Bible frames imagination — thought, word and feeling as God, and what we assume to be true shapes our reality.</p>
<p>The Bible, understood in its intended POV, shows how our <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">inner assumptions create outer conditions</a>. For example, Isaiah’s "<a href="the-suffering-servant-imagination.html">suffering servant</a>" dialogue represents the recognition of the role imagination plays in perceiving the assumptions we habitually hold about ourselves, so that they can be <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">marked</a> for change and transformation</p>
<p>From the first verse of Genesis, the Bible points to inner judgment. The Hebrew word for God, <em>Elohim</em>, means "judges" or "rulers." Right away, it is talking about how each of us rules in our own mind. "You judge who you are—and that becomes your world." This is reinforced in <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">Exodus 3:14</a>, where God reveals Himself as "I AM THAT I AM"—the mental field that shapes reality through imagination.</p>
<p>Neville’s practical advice is simple: assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled. <a href="believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Ask, believe, and live as if it is already true</a>. Follow the example of the <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">core biblical figures as models of assumption</a>: Abraham trusted the unseen, Jacob wrestled with his evolving self, Joseph imagined his future success despite obstacles, and Judah treated his judgments as righteous. These are examples of using your assumptions correctly.</p>
<p>Suffering is a signal that your <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">assumptions are misaligned</a>. By consciously assuming the life you want and trusting your imagination, you can move beyond suffering and bring your desires into reality.</p>
