<h1>The Shulamite’s Secret: Ask, Believe, Receive in the Song of Solomon</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p><strong>Shulamite: Peace in Pleasure and Delight —The Embodiment of Fulfilment</strong></p><p>The name <strong>Shulamite</strong> (Hebrew: שׁוּלַמִּית, <em>Shulammith</em>) is deeply connected to <strong>shalom</strong>—a rich word meaning peace, completeness, and perfect fulfilment. Often considered the feminine counterpart to <strong>Solomon</strong> (<em>Shelomoh</em>), her name reveals more than a mere character; it unveils a profound state of being: the perfect, peaceful rest that comes from fully assuming and embracing the wish fulfilled.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, biblical names are not historical labels but precise symbols of states of consciousness. The Shulamite is therefore not just a poetic lover but the perfect inward stillness and satisfaction one inhabits after fully accepting the reality of their desire.</p><p>The <strong>Song of Solomon</strong> is a mystical allegory—a poetic dance of longing and fulfilment, rich with imaginative symbolism. It tells the story of an inner union: between the masculine force of assumption and the feminine power of embodiment. Solomon represents the peaceful, wise application of imagination, while the Shulamite is the embodiment of the perfect fulfilment that arises from dwelling unwaveringly in that assumption.</p><hr><h2>David: The Beloved — Awakening to Divine Identity</h2><p><strong>David</strong> (דָּוִד, <em>Dawid</em>) means "Beloved." He symbolises the awakening to one’s true identity as the chosen of God—the realisation that <strong>I AM</strong> (<i>Exodus 3:14</i>) is the source and centre of all creation. In Neville’s system, David represents the dawning awareness that your imagination is God in action—the shift from external striving to inward authority.</p><p>This “beloved” consciousness resonates throughout the <strong>Song of Solomon</strong>, where the lovers call each other <em>my beloved</em>. David’s symbolic role as Solomon’s father reflects the truth that conscious imagination (Solomon) is born out of the recognition of divine empowerment (David).</p><hr><h2>Solomon: The Peaceful King — Directed Imagination</h2><p><strong>Solomon</strong> (<em>Shelomoh</em>), whose name also roots in <strong>shalom</strong>, represents the next phase: the wise, peaceful direction of imagination. Solomon is the builder—the one who structures the invisible temple of desire within consciousness.</p><p>His rule is characterised by rest, not resistance. Solomon teaches that creation is not a forceful battle but a peaceful art, a process beginning with the calm assumption of the wish fulfilled.</p><hr><h2>The Shulamite: Embodied Fulfilment — The Perfect Peace Made Visible</h2><p>From Solomon’s peaceful imagination arises the <strong>Shulamite</strong>—the feminine, perfected counterpart. She embodies the outward reflection of inner peace, the world reshaped by a consciousness that rests fully in the reality of the fulfilled desire.</p><p>When she declares, “I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine” (Song of Solomon 6:3), it is not mere romance but a mystical union—the sacred marriage of consciousness and form in delight, adoration and pleasure. Here, the assumed identity and the lived experience merge as one seamless truth.</p><p>The word <em>beloved</em>—rooted in David’s awakening—takes on layers of meaning. It is a reminder that the one who imagines (Solomon) and the one who manifests (Shulamite) both arise from the foundational realisation: <strong>I am the beloved of God; I am that which I seek.</strong></p><hr><h2>A Spiritual Journey in Three Stages</h2><p>Neville Goddard’s symbolic map charts the soul’s progression through these three states:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>David (Beloved):</strong> Awakening to divine identity and the creative power of imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solomon (Peaceful):</strong> The wise and serene direction of that imagination, creating with confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shulamite (Perfect Peace):</strong> The outer world as the echo of that inner peace, the embodiment of assumed fulfilment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is not a story of three separate figures but one soul unfolding—awakening, applying, and embodying the Law of Assumption. The <strong>Song of Solomon</strong> narrates this inner transformation not through doctrine but through longing, fragrance, kisses, and quiet union.</p><hr><h2>Assumption Reflected in the New Testament</h2><p>The timeless principles echoed in the Shulamite’s story resonate deeply with Jesus’ teachings:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”<br>
— Mark 11:24 (KJV)</p>
</blockquote><p>This verse captures the essence of the Shulamite’s state—an inner certainty, a dialogue full of assurance and rest, not hope or pleading. Neville emphasises that belief here is the assumption of the fulfilled state, the peaceful rest of “it is done.” This is Solomon’s peace and the Shulamite’s embodied response.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”<br>
— Matthew 7:7</p>
</blockquote><p>To ask aright is not to beg but to accept the reality of the desire now. The Shulamite embodies this perfect acceptance—assuming the union is already complete.</p><hr><h2>Conclusion: The Inner Romance of Being</h2><p>The <strong>Song of Solomon</strong> is not a love story in the human sense but the soul’s inner romance—the poetic unveiling of creation beginning and ending within. Each name is a key to understanding stages of consciousness:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>David awakens,</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solomon imagines,</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Shulamite perfects and embodies peace.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><p>It is one <em>I AM</em> learning to rest fully in its own belovedness, in the perfect peace of fulfilled desire.</p><p><br></p><div class="share-dropdown">
