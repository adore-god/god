<h1>“Drink the Cup”: The Law of Assumption in Jeremiah 25:15–29</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Jeremiah 25:15–29, the prophet is commanded by God to take a cup filled with the wine of His wrath and <strong>make all the nations drink it</strong>. Those who refuse are told, <em>“You shall surely drink!”</em> It’s a dramatic and unsettling passage—one that speaks of judgment, consequence, and inevitability. But beneath the surface, there lies a profound psychological truth when read through <strong>Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Cup as Assumption</h3>
<p>To Neville, every object in the Bible is symbolic. A <strong>cup</strong> represents a <strong>state of consciousness</strong>—an assumption. Drinking the cup, then, is the act of <strong>accepting and embodying a mental state</strong>, whether willingly or unwillingly. When God gives Jeremiah a cup and tells him to make the nations drink, it is not about vengeance—it’s about <strong>the inevitability of assumption producing experience</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You assume a state. You fuse with it. Then, whether you meant to or not, the consequences will come."<br/>
— <em>Neville Goddard (paraphrased)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each nation symbolises a different <strong>mental state</strong>—and every state has its own outcome. When you accept a thought, identify with it, and dwell in it, you drink of its cup. Whether the state is peace or fear, joy or wrath, the result <strong>must follow</strong>.</p>
<h3>Nations as Inner States</h3>
<p>Jeremiah lists a range of nations: Jerusalem, Egypt, Uz, the kings of the Philistines, Edom, Moab, Ammon, and many others. These are not just ancient kingdoms—they are <strong>inner conditions of the mind</strong>. Each one represents a familiar state:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jerusalem</strong>: the city of peace, symbolising a consciousness that knows truth but is often the first to fall when that truth is rejected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Egypt</strong>: the house of bondage, or belief in material causes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moab and Ammon</strong>: offspring of distorted imagination, born of fear and survival.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Philistines</strong>: opposition and resistance to spiritual advancement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every one of these "nations" within you must <strong>drink the cup of the assumption you persist in</strong>. If you assume yourself poor, unworthy, or rejected, these inner kingdoms will feel the result. If you assume the opposite—abundance, worthiness, divine favour—<strong>the cup changes</strong>, and so does the experience.</p>
<h3>“You Shall Surely Drink”</h3>
<p>The warning, “You shall surely drink,” is not a threat but a <strong>spiritual law</strong>. It reflects the <strong>impartial nature of imagination</strong>. Neville said that imagination will outpicture whatever you accept as true. Refusal does not exempt you—<strong>what you remain conscious of, you will manifest</strong>, because you are always drinking from some cup.</p>
<p>This is the Law of Assumption:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What you assume to be true—persistently and inwardly—is the cup you will drink from.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world, your “nations,” will respond in accordance with that inner act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether joyful or painful, <strong>you live in the harvest of your assumptions.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Jeremiah's cup is not an ancient curse—it is a timeless principle. Every person is Jeremiah. Every day, you hold a cup. The wine within it is the assumption you’ve made—about yourself, your world, and your God. Will you drink unconsciously from the cup of fear, doubt, and separation? Or will you take up the cup of divine imagination, the awareness that <strong>“I AM” is the only truth</strong>?</p>
<p>In Neville’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dare to believe in the reality of your assumption and watch the world respond.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, all the nations <em>will</em> drink. But the wine, dear reader, is yours to choose.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
