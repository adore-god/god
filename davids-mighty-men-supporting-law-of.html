<h1>David’s Mighty Men:  Supporting The Law of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The biblical story of David’s mighty <a href="genesis-126-man.html">men</a> vividly portrays extraordinary warriors who supported King David in his rise to power. Beyond the historical and heroic narrative, Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption invites us to see these figures as symbolic states of consciousness — the <strong><a href="genesis-126-man.html">mighty men</a> within</strong> your own mind, who act as judges, rulers, and divine forces enabling the manifestation of your new reality.</p><h2>Elohim: The Mighty Men Within</h2><p>In the <a href="elohim-god.html">opening chapters of Genesis, God is named <strong>Elohim</strong></a> — a plural term meaning <strong>“gods,” “rulers,” “judges,” or “mighty ones.”</strong> Far from referring to external deities, this plurality symbolises the many inner powers and faculties of imagination that <a href="elohim-god.html">govern your consciousness</a>. These “mighty men” are the active forces within, the divine judges and rulers who direct your inner world by affirming or denying your assumptions.</p><p>Just as Elohim reflects a council of mighty ones working as one creative force, David’s mighty men represent these inner qualities that uphold and defend the new assumed state of being.</p><hr/><h2>David as the New Self-Identity</h2><p>David represents your awakened self — the conscious <strong>I AM</strong> that claims victory, power, and favour. His journey from shepherd to king symbolises your creative process of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">embodying a new self </a>through faithful assumption.</p><hr/><h2>The Mighty Men as Inner Qualities Supporting Manifestation</h2><p>David’s mighty men are not just external warriors but stand for essential inner qualities such as courage, loyalty, and strength. These are the <strong>mighty men</strong> within your consciousness — the judges and rulers described by Elohim — who maintain and protect your new identity against doubt, fear, and old patterns.</p><hr/><h2>The Three Chief Mighty Men: Symbolism in Action</h2><p>The biblical text highlights three chief mighty men, whose heroic exploits richly illustrate stages of inner transformation (2 Samuel 23:8–12; 1 Chronicles 11:10–14):</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The One Who Broke Through Enemy Lines</strong><br>
<em>“Eleazar... struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand stuck to the sword.”</em><br>
This represents the breakthrough in consciousness — the bold, persistent act of faith that shatters limiting beliefs and fear, allowing your assumption to push through mental barriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The One Who Drew Water From a Well Near the Enemy Camp</strong><br>
<em>“The three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem... and brought it to David.”</em><br>
This act symbolises drawing <strong><a href="comparative-interpretation-peter-rock.html">living water</a></strong> — vitality and spiritual strength — from a challenging or “hostile” inner environment. The “well of Bethlehem” here foreshadows the living water Jesus offers, which is the creative power of assumption flowing freely within, sustaining your new self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The One Who Struck Down a Hundred Men</strong><br>
<em>“Abishai... lifted his spear against three hundred men and struck them down.”</em><br>
This depicts the overwhelming power of your assumed reality to decisively overcome all internal opposition — defeating fear, doubt, and outdated self-concepts.</p>
</li>
</ol><hr/><h2>Persistence: Maintaining the Inner Council</h2><p>Just as David’s mighty men continually supported him, the inner qualities they embody must be persistently cultivated. Neville Goddard emphasises <strong>persistence</strong> — remaining faithful to your assumption regardless of outward circumstances. These “mighty men” within are your inner judges and rulers, continually affirming your chosen state and defending it against contradictory influences.</p><hr/><h2>The Power of Names: Hebrew Meaning Deepens Symbolism</h2><p>The Hebrew <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-names-and-genealogies-series.html">names</a> of David’s mighty men deepen their inner significance:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong> means “God has helped,” reflecting divine assistance in breaking through barriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abishai</strong> means “gift of the Father,” embodying courageous strength to overcome obstacles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Benaiah</strong> means “the Lord builds,” symbolising the faithful construction of a new self-identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These meanings beautifully align with Neville’s teaching that imagination, faith, and assumption are the mighty forces that build and sustain your new reality. <a href="from-adam-to-olympas-maturation-of.html">The Hebrew name meanings used in Paul's letters are notably elegant and exalted</a>.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion: Your Inner Mighty Men Are Elohim at Work</h2><p>David’s mighty men are your inner <strong>Elohim</strong> — the judges, rulers, and mighty ones within your own consciousness. They are the active powers of imagination and feeling that govern your mental kingdom. By recognising and cultivating these inner forces, you maintain your new self-identity and manifest your desires with power and persistence.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
