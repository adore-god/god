<h1>God: Loving Neighbouring Aspects of Mind</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The command <em>“<b><a href="genesis-224-love.html">Love</a> your neighbour as yourself</b>”</em> is often taken as a call for outward kindness. But in the teachings of Neville Goddard—and in light of the biblical name <em><a href="elohim-god.html">Elohim , which is rendered God in English</a>, </em>—this command reveals something deeper: a psychological law of creation.</p><p><strong>Your “neighbour” is not the person next to you. It is the next state of mind.</strong> The thought beside your current thought. The feeling that follows your present mood. To love your neighbour is to <a href="genesis-224-love.html">lovingly</a> regard every nearby state—every inner possibility—as yourself.</p><h3>Neighbours Are Mental States Side by Side</h3><p>According to Genesis, <em><a href="elohim-god.html">Elohim</a></em> created the world. But this name, as shown in Strong’s Concordance, is plural—“gods,” “<b>rulers</b>,” “<b>judges</b>,” “<b>divine ones</b>.” It refers not to a single being, but to the <a href="elohim-god.html">multitude of principles and powers active within the mind</a>.</p><p>Neville Goddard saw this Elohim not as an external deity, but as your <strong>imaginative faculties</strong>—the many aspects of consciousness that create reality. Each assumption you hold is a “judge.” Each feeling, a ruler. Each reaction, a god at work.</p><p>And each of these inner rulers exists beside another—just as a neighbour does. Fear sits beside faith. Jealousy beside confidence. Lack beside abundance. These are your neighbours: the mental states you move through.</p><h3>Loving Your Neighbour Means Ruling Well Within</h3><p>To love your neighbour is to <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">rule well over your thoughts</a>. It means <strong>not condemning the adjacent state</strong>, but transforming it through imagination. When you feel sorrow, do not resist it—love it by seeing what joy lies just beside it. When anger arises, bless it by reaching for peace within.</p><p>This is the work of Elohim - God: not suppressing, but judging rightly—deciding what you will accept as true. And every time you choose to love a state by imagining it better, you align the inner judges to a higher decree.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Your world is your self pushed out.”</em> — Neville Goddard</p>
<p>To love your neighbour, then, is to treat every projected state—every mood, person, or problem—as an inner part of you that deserves transformation, not rejection.</p>
</blockquote><h3>The Plural “God” and the Inner Law of Assumption</h3><p>Genesis 1:26 says, <em>“Let us make man in our image.”</em> The “us” here is Elohim—the multiple principles of consciousness that shape identity. “<a href="genesis-126-man.html">Man” is the concept of self, created by what you assume, feel, and declare to be true</a>. When you love your neighbour, you are choosing which inner power will form your self-concept.</p><p>This is why Neville linked <em>Elohim - God</em> to <em><b><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM THAT I AM</a></b></em> (Exodus 3:14). Whatever you say <em>I AM</em> to, you give creative power. And whatever follows becomes part of your reality. Loving your neighbour is loving your own next declaration. It’s choosing what you will allow <em>I AM</em> to become.</p><h3>Loving the Next State into Harmony</h3><p>You are always surrounded by mental neighbours—states waiting to be entered. The command to love them is a reminder that your reality is ruled by internal decree. Every judgement you make becomes law. So, judge lovingly.</p><p>If a situation reflects limitation, love it by imagining freedom. If a person seems harsh, love them by assuming kindness. These are not moral niceties. They are creative acts—adjusting the inner Elohim so that your world may follow.</p><h3>Final Reflection</h3><p>“Love your neighbour as yourself” is not about outward effort—it is about inward dominion. Your neighbour is every nearby state. Elohim is the collective rulership of imagination. And love is the law that governs transformation</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-elohim--god-series.html" class="noTag">Elohim: God Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-parable-series.html" class="noTag">Parable Series</a></p>
