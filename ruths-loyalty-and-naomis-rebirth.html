<h1>Naomi and Ruth: Widowed to Cleaving </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<div>The <a href="label-ruth-series.html" class="noTag">Book of Ruth</a>, when read symbolically through Neville Goddard’s psychological teachings, becomes a spiritual allegory—a drama of inner movement from barrenness to manifestation. This is not the story of ancient <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">women</a>, but of the soul’s journey: from identification with loss to union with imagination and the birth of a new state of being. Naomi, <a href="ruth-and-boaz.html">Ruth, and Boaz</a> are not individuals, but <strong>aspects of you</strong>, representing phases in the process of creating reality.</div><hr><h3>Naomi’s Widowhood: Trapped in the Parental Framework</h3><p>Naomi symbolises the <strong>conscious identity stuck in the inherited framework</strong>—the “father and mother” of Genesis 2:24. That verse reads:<br>
<em></em></p><blockquote><em>“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”</em></blockquote><p></p><p>Psychologically, this is not about literal <a href="label-marriage-series.html" class="noTag">marriage</a>, but the law of creation:<br>
<strong>To manifest, consciousness must leave inherited beliefs and unite with imagination.</strong></p><p><a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Naomi</a>, as a <a href="the-many-faces-of-subconscious-women-of.html">widow</a>, is <strong>cut off from her “<a href="label-marriage-series.html" class="noTag">husband</a>”—the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></strong>, the assumption that gives life. She remains trapped in memory, in bitterness, no longer embodying her name, which means <em><a href="eden-and-sarah-return-to-pleasure-in.html">pleasant</a></em>. Her self-description as “Mara” (bitter) shows that she has lost contact with joy, the very joy that defines creative alignment. Her description as 'bitter' also reminds us of the defining interaction between the <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Lord and Cain</a> where Cain is rejected as described as <i>angry</i> and <i>sad</i>.</p><p>And yet, this disconnection is <strong>the necessary emptying</strong>—the death of the old self that must occur before a new assumption can be planted.</p><hr><h3>Ruth: The Subconscious Reaching to Cleave</h3><p>Enter <a href="ruth-and-boaz.html">Ruth</a>, not just a character, but the <strong>subconscious projection of Naomi’s own inner movement</strong>. Naomi herself cannot yet move, but the subconscious begins the process. Ruth is Naomi’s <strong>subconscious attempt to <a href="genesis-224-love.html">cleave</a></strong>—to fulfil the law of Genesis 2:24. She is imagination reaching out to join with a new assumption.</p><p><a href="ruth-and-boaz.html">Ruth</a>, the Moabite (outsider), represents the creative imagination—still faithful even when the <a href="elohim-god.html">conscious</a> mind (Naomi) feels barren and bitter. Her name means <em>friendship</em>, reflecting the inner bond between consciousness and imagination. Ruth’s decision to leave her people and follow Naomi back to Bethlehem (“house of bread”) is the subconscious detaching from old limitations and aligning with the spiritual nourishment of the new state.</p><p><em>“Where you go, I will go.”</em><br>
These are not idle words—they are the subconscious choosing to <strong>align itself to consciousness</strong>, to participate in a new inner union. This is <strong><a href="genesis-224-love.html">cleaving</a></strong>.</p><hr><h3>Boaz: The Redeemer Assumption</h3><p><a href="ruth-and-boaz.html">Boaz</a> enters as the <strong>masculine principle of assumption</strong>—the strong, redemptive “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” state that the subconscious seeks union with. When <a href="ruth-and-boaz.html">Ruth meets Boaz in the field</a> (the Field of conscious awareness), it is the symbolic union of imagination and a new assumption. Boaz is the new identity—no longer “I AM bitter” but “I AM redeemed,” “I AM blessed,” “I AM fruitful.”</p><p>This union is <strong>the fulfilment of Genesis 2:24</strong>:<br>
The old identity (Naomi) cannot cleave—but <strong>Ruth, the subconscious, can</strong>. And through this cleaving, a new state is conceived.</p><hr><h3>Obed: The Manifestation Born of Union</h3><p>From the union of Ruth and Boaz comes <strong><a href="the-lineage-of-christ-journey-through.html">Obed</a></strong>, whose name means <em>servant</em> or <em>worshipper</em>. He symbolises <strong>the manifested result of the assumption</strong>—a new experience birthed from imagination and faith.</p><p>But the true climax of the story is <strong>Naomi taking Obed into her lap</strong>.</p><p>This is more than comfort. In Neville Goddard’s language, it is the <strong>conscious self embracing the result of its own subconscious activity</strong>. Naomi—the formerly bitter consciousness—now holds in her lap the very thing she once thought lost. She receives the child of imagination. This is the <strong>materialisation of the desire once felt as a distant hope.</strong></p><p>Naomi had called herself Mara, but now, in holding Obed, she returns to her true name—<strong>Naomi</strong>, meaning <em>pleasant</em>. She symbolically returns to <strong><a href="label-eden-series.html" class="noTag">Eden</a></strong>, a word that also means <strong>“pleasure.”</strong> Its a symbolic parallel to when Moana returns Te Fiti's heart to her. What was once bitter is now blooming. The state of inner suffering has become the place of fulfilment.</p><hr><h3>The Return to Eden: Consciousness Restored</h3><p><a href="label-eden-series.html" class="noTag">Eden</a> is not a garden behind us, but a state within us—<strong>a life aligned with joy, power, and creative authority</strong>. Naomi’s story shows the soul’s movement from a false identity—bound by circumstance—to the true self, reunited with imagination and receiving its fruit. This same story is repeated in the <a href="label-song-of-solomon-series.html" class="noTag">Song of Solomon</a></p><p>When Naomi holds Obed, it is the return to Eden. She has left the old world of “I AM bitter” and accepted “I AM fulfilled.” The man has cleaved to his wife; the subconscious and conscious have become one flesh—and the result is life.</p><hr><h3>Conclusion: The Law Fulfilled</h3><p>The story of Naomi and Ruth is the spiritual anatomy of manifestation.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Naomi</strong>: The barren conscious mind, cut off from assumption, stuck in the mother-father framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ruth</strong>: The subconscious, imaginative faculty faithfully reaching out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Boaz</strong>: The redeemer assumption—the new “I AM” state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Obed</strong>: The manifestation, the desire now made flesh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Naomi receiving Obed</strong>: The conscious mind finally embracing its own creation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Through the symbolism of Genesis 2:24, we see that <strong>manifestation is born when consciousness detaches from old inherited thought and joins with imagination in faith</strong>. When the subconscious cleaves to the “I AM,” what is conceived will surely be born.</p><p>And when it is born—<strong>you will take it into your lap</strong>.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-genesis-2-24-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 2:24 Series</a> | <a href="label-marriage-series.html" class="noTag">Marriage Series</a> | <a href="label-ruth-series.html" class="noTag">Ruth Series</a> | <a href="label-women-in-the-bible-series.html" class="noTag">Women in the Bible Series</a></p>
