<h1>Samuel, David and Saul</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The Bible is not a record of history—it’s a guide to understanding <a href="elohim-god.html">self-rule and consciousness</a>. Every character represents a psychological posture within the mind, and the story of Samuel, Saul, and David shows how we begin to recognise our <a class="noTag" href="genesis-224-love.html">habitual patterns that Genesis 2:24 teaches us to leave </a>, and consciously move toward the self we want to live as.</p>

<h2>Samuel: Hearing Yourself</h2>
<p>Samuel means <em>“hearing.”</em> He represents the first moment your mind starts to listen to itself—the inner dialogue you usually ignore. When Samuel hears God calling and replies</p><blockquote>“Speak, for your servant hears” — 1 Samuel 3:10
</blockquote><p>this is the moment of awareness: you begin to notice your own thoughts, assumptions, and choices.</p>

<p>Samuel mediates between two possibilities that emerge simultaneously in your consciousness: the patterns you’ve always followed, and the self you are starting to choose. He is not action itself but awareness—the inner guide showing you what is possible when you respond to the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">Law of Assumption</a>.</p>

<h2>Saul: Noticing the Old Patterns</h2>
<p>Saul means <em>“asked for”</em> or <em>“desired”, which points out the <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">sin of desiring as opposed to embodying.</a></em> He represents the version of yourself you become aware of when you listen. He embodies the habits, fears, and automatic ways of thinking that have governed your life up to this point. Saul is not “bad”; he simply shows what keeps you stuck—where old assumptions have ruled and shaped your experience.</p>

<p>By recognising Saul, you can see the difference between habitual reactions and deliberate choices. This is an essential step: transformation begins with awareness.</p>

<h2>David: The Self You Choose</h2>
<p><a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David means <em>“beloved.”</em> He represents the self you want to live as</a>—the person you choose when you act on the awareness Samuel brings. Unlike Saul, David is guided by assumption: he does not rely on effort, appearances, or fear. David faces challenges—symbolised by Goliath—not with armour or force, but with imagination and confidence in the desired outcome.</p>

<p>The story shows that the old self does not need to be destroyed. By choosing to live as David, the emerging self naturally replaces Saul’s influence in your mind. The new self becomes dominant not by struggle but by conscious assumption.</p>

<h2>The Three Together</h2>
<p>Samuel, Saul, and David are not sequential events in history; they are simultaneous conceptions in your mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Samuel:</strong> awareness—the part of your mind listening and mediating.</li>
  <li><strong>Saul:</strong> the habitual self you notice when you begin to pay attention.</li>
  <li><strong>David:</strong> the self you choose to live as, formed through assumption.</li>
</ul>

<p>The story demonstrates the process of psychological transformation: noticing the old patterns, discerning the self you want instead, and prioritising that emerging self in your life. Samuel makes this shift possible by helping you hear yourself, and the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">Law of Assumption</a> does the rest.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Samuel</strong> – Hearing yourself and discerning the difference between the old and new you.</li>
  <li><strong>Saul</strong> – The patterns and habits you notice in your mind.</li>
  <li><strong>David</strong> – The self you assume and live as.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through Neville Goddard’s teachings, the Bible is revealed not as history but as a guide to consciousness—showing how awareness, assumption, and imagination create the life you experience.</p>
