<p>
Genesis 24 is usually read as a story about Abraham’s servant finding a wife for Isaac, but through Neville Goddard’s teaching it becomes a clear demonstration of the Law of Assumption. <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham </a>, the servant, Rebekah, and Isaac all represent inner functions of the mind involved in assuming a new state.
</p>

<p>
But the story also follows the objective given earlier in Genesis 2:24—the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">movement of the mind toward unity</a>.</p> 
<blockquote> 
“A man shall leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”
</blockquote> 
<p>In Neville’s interpretation, this is not about physical marriage. It describes the inner joining of your awareness (“<a href="genesis-126-man.html">the man</a>”) with the state desired (“the wife”), until they fuse as one experience of being.
</p>

<h2>Why Not a Canaanite Woman? Understanding Abraham’s Warning</h2>

<p>Abraham’s warning not to take a wife for Isaac from the daughters of Canaan symbolises that a new assumption (Isaac) cannot be joined to old limiting beliefs. The “daughters of Canaan” represent mental patterns tied to the old self — the identity formed by the outer world.</p>

<p>
This reinforces the principle shown in Genesis 2:24: the true “bride” must arise from within — <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">from the state that matches the desire</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh. – Genesis 2:24
</blockquote>

<p>
In Neville’s terms, you cannot unite the new “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM that I AM</a>” with an old assumption. The bride must arise from the inner country of faith — from the state where the desire was formed.
</p>

<h2>Rebekah as Eve and the Inner Correspondence</h2>

<blockquote>
“This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.” — Genesis 2:23
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Rebekah plays the same symbolic role as Eve</a>. She represents the inner correspondence that appears when a new assumption has been accepted. Isaac is the assumption (“I AM this”). Rebekah is the matching inner image produced when the new identity has truly been taken on. Their union is the joining of assumption and inner acceptance — the moment manifestation begins.
</p>

<h2>Abraham Sends His Servant: Faith and the Seed of Desire</h2>

<blockquote>
“Abraham said to his servant, ‘You will go to my country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son Isaac.’” (Genesis 24:4)
</blockquote>

<p>
Abraham symbolises faith — the <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">planting of the desire</a>. He sends the servant, who represents imagination acting on that faith. The servant’s outward journey is the inner movement of imagining the fulfilled wish.
</p>

<h2>The Well: The Inner Source of Living Water</h2>

<blockquote>
“You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride; you are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain.” — Song of Solomon 4:12
</blockquote>

<p>
The well represents the deeper creative level of mind — the place from which assumed states rise into expression. Rebekah appearing at the well before the servant finishes praying shows how quickly the inner life responds when the assumption is clear.
</p>

<p>
<a href="joseph-of-new-testament-witness-to.html">Her “virginity” symbolises new, untouched possibility</a> — an inner state not shaped by old beliefs.
</p>

<h2>The Prayer and the Sign: The Law of Assumption in Action</h2>

<p>
The servant’s prayer is simply focused assumption.
</p>

<blockquote>
“O Lord, God of my master Abraham, give me success today... Make the woman who answers my prayer the one you have chosen for Isaac.” (Genesis 24:12–14)
</blockquote>

<p>
Rebekah’s action — offering water freely to the servant and the <a href="camels-in-bible-symbol-of-faith-and-law.html">camels</a> — is the clear inner sign that the assumption has been accepted and is beginning to clothe itself in facts. Neville taught that once the feeling of the wish fulfilled is reached, outer events align accordingly.
</p>

<h2>Rebekah and Isaac: The Inner Marriage of Desire and Fulfilment</h2>

<blockquote>
“Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah... and she became his wife.” (Genesis 24:67)
</blockquote>

<p>
Isaac is the realised identity; Rebekah is the inner form that corresponds to it. Their union is the manifestation — the point where the assumed identity and its inner counterpart become one flesh. This is the same psychological pattern expressed in Genesis 2:24.
</p>

<h2>The Rivers of Eden and the Flow of Imaginative Power</h2>

<p>
The <a class="noTag" href="the-four-rivers-of-eden-flowing-delight.html">rivers of Eden in Genesis 2 symbolise the ever flowing stream</a> of thought, feeling and consciousness in itself. Likewise, the well in Genesis 24 represents the moment the inner movement of imagination begins to express itself.
</p>

<h2>The Repetition of the Story: The Servant’s Double Recounting</h2>

<blockquote>
“And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.” (Genesis 24:66)
</blockquote>

<p>
Just like the four Gospels repeat the same story but <a href="el/four-gospels-progressive-attempts.html">are repeated and progressively improve in assumption</a>, the servant recounts the story twice — once to Rebekah’s family and again to Isaac. This reflects Neville’s emphasis on repetition and <a href="the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">identical harvest</a>. Persistence embeds the assumed state more deeply until it is fully accepted and naturally expressed.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Conclusion: The Secret of Genesis 24</h3>

<p>
Through the Law of Assumption, Genesis 24 becomes the story of how faith (Abraham), imagination (the servant), and the inner creative process (the well) work together to produce the inner bride (Rebekah) that matches the assumed identity (Isaac).
</p>

<p>
The message is simple: assume the state, persist in the assumption, and your inner creative power will produce the perfect correspondence. When the inner and outer match, the “marriage” occurs — and the desired state becomes your lived reality.
