<h1>Was It Jesus or Moses? Rethinking Egypt and Deliverance</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Jude 1:5 offers one of the most curious lines in the New Testament:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that Jesus (or the <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a>) once saved a people out of the land of Egypt, but afterward destroyed those who did not believe."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first glance, the statement seems startling. Jesus saving <a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel</a> out of Egypt? But wasn’t it Moses who led the <a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israelites</a> out of their physical bondage in Egypt? Let’s explore this on two levels — literal history and spiritual symbolism — and see how it connects to Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption.</p>
<h3>The literal historical view</h3>
<p>From a historical perspective, this verse points to the well-known story in Exodus. The Israelites, enslaved in Egypt, are delivered through a series of miraculous events under the leadership of <a href="scrolls/label-moses-series.html" class="noTag">Moses</a>. This event is foundational to Jewish identity and later Christian theology, often cited as an archetype of salvation.</p>
<p>Some early manuscripts of Jude use “the <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a>” instead of “<a href="is-jesus-god-or-not-discover-hidden.html">Jesus</a>,” which aligns with the Old Testament understanding. However, some later manuscripts and translations use “Jesus,” suggesting that Christ, as the eternal Logos or divine Word, was present and active even then. In order of appearance, Jesus as the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> from Nazareth was not there; Moses was the Presence who acted.</p>
<h3>The symbolic or psychological view: The Law of Assumption</h3>
<p>According to Neville Goddard, the Bible is not a record of external events but a psychological drama describing the evolution of self-perception. Egypt symbolises any state of mental bondage — states of fear, limitation, or self-condemnation.</p>
<p>Under the Law of Assumption, “<a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a>” represents the awakened imagination — the “<a href="is-jesus-god-or-not-discover-hidden.html">I AM</a>” presence within you that has the power to move you out of <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">any restrictive state </a>(your personal "<a href="scrolls/label-spiritual-geography.html" class="noTag">Egypt</a>"). In this view, to “save a people out of Egypt” means to <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume a new state </a>of being that frees you from old limitations.</p>
<p>The "destruction of those who did not believe" refers not to external punishment, but to the dissolution of old mental states that no longer serve you. When you fully inhabit a new assumption, the former self-image and old habits "perish" because they cannot coexist with the new identity.</p>
<h3>Bridging the two views</h3>
<p><a href="scrolls/label-moses-series.html" class="noTag">Moses</a> led a people (mental, undisciplined crowd) out of slavery. Spiritually, the Christ within — <a href="genesis-126-man.html">your own awareness of being</a> — delivers you from mental slavery. Jude’s reference to <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus saving </a>people out of Egypt symbolises that this liberating power was always present and is eternally available within each individual.</p>
<p>The verse reminds us that the true exodus is not just a historical march out of a foreign land, but an inner exodus from self-imposed prisons. In every moment you choose a new assumption, you enact your own departure from Egypt.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong><br>
Whether read as literal history or as inner allegory, Jude 1:5 invites us to recognise the power within us to leave behind limiting states and step into the promised land of our fulfilled desires.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-moses-series.html" class="noTag">Moses Series</a></p>
