<h1>Romans 12:2: Passage Analysis </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Romans 12:2 holds a key message in Neville Goddard's teachings, one that speaks to the <strong>power of the mind</strong> and how we can transform our reality through the creative force of imagination. Neville consistently emphasised that the Bible is not a historical record but a guide to the <strong>inner workings of consciousness</strong>. Through this lens, Romans 12:2 invites us to <strong>renew our minds</strong> and use our imagination to consciously create the life we desire.</p>
<h4><strong>The Verse: Romans 12:2 (BBE Translation)</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s break this down through Neville's perspective.</p>
<h4><strong>1. “Be not fashioned according to this world”</strong></h4>
<p>To <strong>not be fashioned according to this world</strong> means we are <strong>not defined by external circumstances</strong> or the limitations that society imposes on us. The "world" in Neville's teaching refers to <strong>the outer reality</strong> we see around us—the physical conditions, societal expectations, and the influence of others. In Neville's view, this world is a mere <strong>reflection of our inner state of mind</strong>.</p>
<p>When you are <strong>fashioned by the world</strong>, you are simply reacting to what is already there. But Neville teaches that we are <strong>creators, not reactors</strong>. To be <strong>transformed</strong>, you must cease to allow the world’s appearance to dictate your reality. Instead of responding to the world’s problems, you begin to <strong>imagine a new reality</strong> and allow it to reshape the world around you. You are not a victim of the outer world, but a <strong>creator of your inner world</strong>, and it is this inner world that shapes your outer experiences.</p>
<h4><strong>2. “But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind”</strong></h4>
<p>In Neville's interpretation, the <strong>renewing of your mind</strong> is the process of <strong>changing the way you think</strong>—specifically, changing the way you imagine. He constantly spoke about the <strong>imagination</strong> as the most powerful creative tool. It is the faculty through which we bring our desires into physical form.</p>
<p>To be <strong>transformed</strong> is to <strong>renew your mind</strong> by changing your beliefs and thoughts. It is through imagination that we consciously create the life we desire. Neville encouraged his students to <strong>imagine the end result</strong> of what they want, to live in the feeling of that wish fulfilled, and to <strong>become that version of themselves</strong> in imagination before it manifests in the physical world.</p>
<p>Transformation, therefore, doesn’t happen by simply wishing for change, but by <strong>mentally stepping into the reality</strong> you wish to create. This requires <strong>discipline of thought</strong>—actively imagining the desired state and persistently holding that vision in your mind, ignoring the current external conditions that might contradict your desired reality.</p>
<h4><strong>3. “That ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God”</strong></h4>
<p>In Neville's teachings, <strong>God</strong> represents the <strong>imagination</strong> or the <strong>creative power within you</strong>. To <strong>prove the good and acceptable will of God</strong> is to <strong>prove that your imagination</strong> can create the reality you desire. The good and perfect will of God is not something external but the <strong>perfect manifestation of your inner desires</strong>. It is when you align your inner thoughts, feelings, and beliefs with the end result you want, and trust that the creative power of imagination will bring it to fruition.</p>
<p>Neville often stated that the external world is a reflection of our inner state. So, when we <strong>prove the good and acceptable will of God</strong>, we are essentially <strong>proving the law of imagination</strong>—we are showing that the world around us will shift in alignment with the mental images we hold in consciousness.</p>
<h4><strong>The Role of Grace in Transformation</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Grace</strong> is a key element in Neville's understanding of manifestation. It is the <strong>effortless unfolding of desires</strong> when we have aligned ourselves with the law of imagination. Grace represents the moment when we trust the process of manifestation, knowing that once we have imagined and felt the reality we desire, it will come into being in its own perfect time.</p>
<p>When we are truly in a state of grace, we are no longer <strong>forcing</strong> our desires into reality. We have surrendered the "how" and the "when" to the creative power within, knowing that the universe is responding to our inner state of being. Transformation then becomes a natural process, where we are no longer striving, but <strong>allowing</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Praise and the Power of Imagination</strong></h4>
<p>Praise is another central aspect of Neville's teaching. To <strong>praise</strong> is to <strong>recognise and celebrate</strong> what you have already imagined as being real. In Neville's framework, praise is a form of <strong>gratitude</strong> and <strong>belief</strong>, acknowledging that your desires are already fulfilled in the inner world.</p>
<p>In the context of Romans 12:2, <strong>praise</strong> is a powerful act that solidifies the transformation process. By praising the manifestation before it appears in the physical world, you are affirming your <strong>belief</strong> in the power of your imagination. You are also aligning your consciousness with the reality you desire, reinforcing the <strong>feeling of already having it</strong>.</p>
<p>Neville often spoke of <strong>feeling</strong> the end result as if it is already present. Praise is one way to <strong>feel the reality</strong> of what you are imagining, and in doing so, you amplify its manifestation.</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h4>
<p>Romans 12:2, when interpreted through Neville Goddard’s teachings, calls us to <strong>transform our consciousness</strong> by renewing our mind and aligning it with the desires of our hearts. The world is not something to be passively reacted to, but something to be <strong>actively shaped</strong> through the power of imagination. By ceasing to be <strong>fashioned by the world</strong> and instead renewing our thoughts, we prove the power of imagination in manifesting the perfect will of God—our desired reality.</p>
<p>Grace is an essential element in this transformation, allowing desires to unfold naturally without force. Praise strengthens this process by affirming our belief in the creative power of imagination and celebrating its fulfilment before it appears in the physical world.</p>
<p>Romans 12:2 teaches us that <strong>transformation is a conscious act of imagination</strong>. By choosing to renew our minds and align them with our desires, we step into the creative power within us and transform our lives.</p>
