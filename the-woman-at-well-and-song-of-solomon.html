<h1>Woman at the Well and the Song of Solomon</h1>
<p>The <strong>Song of Solomon</strong> is not a romantic poem—it is <strong>assumption in action</strong>. It is the symbolic outpouring of a soul so fully possessed by the image of its beloved that it becomes one with it. This is not outer romance, but <strong>inner realisation</strong>. It is the dramatisation of the <strong>soul’s longing and eventual union</strong> with its imagined fulfilment—what <strong>Neville Goddard</strong> would describe as the creative act of assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p><p>When read alongside the story of the <strong>Woman at the Well</strong> in <strong>John 4</strong>, the Song of Solomon unveils itself as a commentary on <strong>spiritual marriage</strong>—the union of <strong>consciousness with the subconscious</strong>, or in Neville’s terms, the impregnation of the subconscious by the conscious assumption.</p><p>What appears to be a casual conversation between Jesus and a Samaritan woman is, in fact, a mystical courtship, culminating in the recognition of the true Beloved: the <strong>‘I AM’</strong> within.</p><hr/><h2><strong>“I Found Him Whom My Soul Loves”</strong></h2><p>In the Song of Solomon 3:1–4, the feminine soul searches restlessly:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“On my bed by night I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not... I will rise now... I will seek him...”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This yearning is the same as the <strong>Samaritan woman’s thirst</strong>. She has cycled through relationships, but none has quenched her. Her soul is reaching beyond appearances for her <strong>true source</strong>. She does not yet know what she is truly thirsty for—until Jesus reveals:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“If you knew the gift of God... you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”</em> (John 4:10)</p>
</blockquote><p>This is not about literal thirst. It is the <strong>deep desire of the soul for reunion with its source</strong>—what Neville would call the reunion of <strong>awareness with the I AM</strong>. The woman, like the lover in Solomon’s poem, finally encounters that which she could not name but always longed for.</p><hr/><h2><strong>The Garden and the Well: A Return to Eden</strong></h2><p>The imagery in <strong>Song of Solomon</strong> is steeped in <strong>garden, spring, and well</strong> metaphors—all feminine, all fertile, all subconscious.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse;<br/>
a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.”</em> (Song 4:12)</p>
<p><em>“A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.”</em> (Song 4:15)</p>
</blockquote><p>These images describe the <strong>subconscious</strong>: private, enclosed, but holding within it the <strong>source of all manifestation</strong>. Just like the Samaritan woman, who comes to the well daily, drawing from the same patterns, until the true “husband” arrives and awakens the garden.</p><p>The <strong>living water</strong> Jesus offers is not new—it is a <strong>restoration of the original flow</strong> that once streamed from Eden itself. In Genesis 2, we are told that a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four heads. This is the same symbolic flow of <strong>life, awareness, and creative energy</strong>. Eden means <strong>pleasure</strong>—and the water flowing from it is the joy and power of creation flowing in its intended order.</p><p>The woman, barren in fulfilment, meets her Eden again. And the water becomes <strong>living</strong>.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Leaving Father and Mother: The Call to Inner Union</strong></h2><p>We must return to Genesis 2:24:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“A man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In mystical terms, this is the call to <strong>leave behind inherited beliefs, ancestral conditioning, and external dependencies</strong>—and to join inwardly with the one presence that gives life: the <strong>I AM</strong>. This leaving and cleaving is the very act the Samaritan woman undergoes. She leaves her waterpot, leaves her routine, and cleaves to the truth: <em>“I who speak to you am He.”</em></p><p>Likewise, in Song of Solomon, the soul finally joins the beloved:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I found him whom my soul loves. I held him and would not let him go.”</em> (Song 3:4)</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the moment of <strong>union</strong>. The soul has recognised the only lover who satisfies—the <strong>divine centre</strong> within. The “I AM” becomes the bridegroom, and the soul is the bride.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Neville’s Interpretation: The Creative Act</strong></h2><p>Neville taught that <strong>the masculine is the conscious mind</strong>, and the <strong>feminine is the subconscious</strong>. Every creation is born of their union. When you declare, <em>“I am wealthy,” “I am healed,” “I am free,”</em> with conviction, you are joining yourself to the Beloved. This is not mechanical affirmation—it is <strong>spiritual intercourse</strong>. The inner marriage, as Solomon might say, takes place in the <strong>garden of the heart</strong>, where desire meets belief.</p><p>And so, the well becomes a garden. The woman becomes a bride. The Messiah becomes the bridegroom. And the water becomes <strong>living</strong>—flowing again like Eden's rivers, bringing back the <strong>pleasure and purpose</strong> that was lost.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Conclusion: You Are the Well, You Are the Bride</strong></h2><p>In both stories—the <strong>Samaritan woman</strong> and the <strong>Shulamite bride</strong>—the feminine aspect is transformed through union with the Beloved. The transformation is not moral or behavioural—it is <strong>ontological</strong>. They remember who they are by recognising who He is.</p><p>This is the inner journey Neville taught:<br/>
To cease looking outward for answers.<br/>
To leave behind the false authorities (“father and mother”).<br/>
To meet yourself at the well.<br/>
To hear the voice: <em>“I who speak to you am He.”</em></p><p>And to let that presence—<strong>the awareness of being</strong>—cleave to your subconscious in love.</p><p>Only then does the garden bloom.<br/>
Only then does the living water flow.<br/>
Only then do you return to Eden—<strong>the pleasure of being</strong>—<br/>
and find Him whom your soul loves,<br/>
<strong>within</strong>.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bride---bridegroom-series.html">Bride — Bridegroom Series</a> | <a href="label-brides-at-the-well.html">Brides at the Well</a> | <a href="label-genesis-2-24-series.html">Genesis 2:24 Series</a> | <a href="label-marriage-series.html">Marriage Series</a> | <a href="label-song-of-solomon-series.html">Song of Solomon Series</a></p>
