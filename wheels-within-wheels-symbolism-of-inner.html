<blockquote> 
"The image of a wheel turning within a wheel powerfully illustrates how your outer life rotates in harmony with your inner assumptions and beliefs.
<br/> <br/> It is the definition of "I AM the Alpha and the Omega" in Revelation 1:8</blockquote>
<p>One mysterious and poetic image in the Bible appears in the Book of Ezekiel: <strong>“a wheel in the middle of a wheel”</strong> (Ezekiel 1:16). At first glance, this vision may seem abstract, mechanical, or even confusing. However, through the teachings of Neville Goddard, we uncover a deeply meaningful symbol of inner transformation, <a href="elohim-god.html">conscious movement</a>, and the multi-layered nature of our imagination.</p><h2>The Vision: Ezekiel’s Wheels</h2><p>Ezekiel writes:</p><blockquote>
<p>“This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: they sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.</p><p>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about as the creatures went. Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around"</p><p>
— Ezekiel 1:15-18 NKJV</p>
</blockquote><p>This heavenly vision depicts complex, living wheels full of eyes, moving effortlessly in all directions without needing to turn in the usual way. </p><p></p><blockquote>“And the edges of the four wheels were full of eyes round about.” — Ezekiel 10:12 </blockquote><p></p><p>Far from being a literal machine, Neville interprets this imagery as a symbol of the self-regulating, multidimensional movement of consciousness.</p><h2>Elohim: The Plural Majesty of Consciousness</h2><p>To fully appreciate Ezekiel’s vision, we must consider the <a href="elohim-god.html">Hebrew name for God</a> used throughout the Old Testament: <strong>Elohim</strong> (אֱלֹהִים). According to Strong’s Concordance (#430) and interlinear Hebrew sources, <strong>Elohim is a plural noun</strong>—literally meaning “mighty ones” or “divine ones.” It is derived from the root <strong>’El (אל)</strong>, meaning “mighty” or “strong one,” with the plural masculine suffix <strong>-im</strong>.</p><p>Despite its plural form, Elohim typically refers to the <strong><a href="elohim-god.html">one true God acting as a singular, unified being</a></strong>, often taking singular verbs in the text. This grammatical paradox expresses the <strong>plural majesty and fullness of God’s power</strong>, suggesting a unity composed of many attributes and creative forces working in harmony.</p><p>Just like the “wheel within a wheel” that moves seamlessly in multiple directions, <strong>Elohim represents a dynamic unity—an awareness that is many and yet one</strong>. This plurality within unity reflects the complex, multidimensional nature of imagination and awareness itself.</p><h2>The Inner and Outer Wheels: Consciousness in Motion</h2><p>Neville taught that all outward movement begins in the imagination. The <strong>outer wheel</strong> represents the physical world, the visible events and conditions we experience. The <strong>inner wheel</strong>, hidden yet central, is our own awareness—the “I AM” at the core—turning quietly and generating the outer reality.</p><p>In Neville’s words, <strong>“The world is yourself pushed out.”</strong> The image of a wheel turning within a wheel powerfully illustrates how your outer life rotates in harmony with your inner assumptions and beliefs.</p><p>This is not static. The wheels suggest perpetual motion and transformation. Your beliefs, emotions, and assumptions are continuously turning. When you change the inner wheel—your self-concept—the outer wheel, the world you perceive, naturally follows.</p><h2>The Many Eyes: Self-Awareness and Watchfulness</h2><p>Ezekiel’s wheels are covered in eyes, symbolising awareness and watchfulness. For Neville, the eye represents the faculty of self-observation—the ability to notice one’s inner dialogue, emotions, and mental states.</p><p>Self-awareness is the key to deliberate creation. You cannot change your reality without first observing and understanding where your inner wheel is turning.</p><h2>Spirals, Layers, and Dimensions of Consciousness</h2><p>A wheel within a wheel is not merely about cause and effect but depth and dimension. Self-perception is not linear; it spirals and loops. The recurring challenges and patterns in life are not failures but deeper layers of growth—wheels turning inside wheels, drawing you closer to full self-realisation.</p><p>Neville emphasised that states of consciousness exist on multiple levels. What appears as repetition can be the ascending spiral of transformation.</p><h2>From Elohim to Legion: The Original and the Fragmented States</h2><p>Elohim, with its plural majesty, expresses the <strong>original, unpolluted state of awareness</strong>—whole, unified, and multidimensional. This contrasts sharply with the state symbolised in the <a href="legion-according-to-neville-goddard.html">story of Legion</a> (Mark 5:1–20), where many fragmented inner voices or “demons” possess a man, representing a consciousness splintered into victimhood and limiting beliefs.</p><p>The vision of Ezekiel’s wheels and the name Elohim remind us of the <strong>pure creative power within us</strong>, the original “wheel” of imagination and conscious awareness before it becomes scattered or polluted by fear, doubt, and fragmentation.</p><h2>Conclusion: You Are the Centre of the Divine Movement</h2><p>The wheel within a wheel teaches that we are not powerless observers but the centre of all reality. The core wheel is your imagination—your “I AM”—the creative power spinning the visible world into being.</p><p>When life feels chaotic or repetitive, remember: the outer wheel responds to the inner one. Your assumptions, feelings, and inner speech turn the mechanism of your world, even if you don’t yet see the results.</p><p>By consciously moving the inner wheel—imagining boldly, believing faithfully, and feeling deeply—you align with the sacred machinery of Elohim, the many-mighty One, who continuously creates and sustains all things.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
