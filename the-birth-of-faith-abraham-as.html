<h1>Abraham and Isaac: Faith in Laughter </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<blockquote><p><em>“And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.”</em><br>
— Galatians 6:9</p>
</blockquote><p>Faith is not optimism—it is a state of <i>being</i>. It is the invisible certainty that defines and directs every visible outcome. In the biblical story of manifestation, Abraham stands as the first '<a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>" to fully embody this principle. His life marks the <strong>birth of faith</strong>, not as passive belief but as active assumption. Neville Goddard often taught that manifestation begins in the unseen, and Abraham shows us how to stand unwavering in that invisible conviction.</p><hr><h2><strong>The First Stirring of Faith</strong></h2><p>Abraham’s journey begins in <em>Genesis 12</em>, where he receives the promise without evidence, plan, or support:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Now the Lord said to Abram, Go out of your country, and away from your family and your father’s house, into a land which I will show you: And I will make of you a great nation, blessing you and making your name great; and you will be a blessing.”</em><br>
— Genesis 12:1–2</p>
</blockquote><p>This promise is not supported by outward logic. Abraham is an <a href="long-lifespans-in-genesis-long-dwelling.html">old mindset</a>. Sarah as loving imagination is barren. But faith is never about what can be seen. It is the inward "yes" to what the senses deny. For Neville, this is the Law of Assumption—the ability to dwell in the feeling of the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">wish fulfilled</a>, even while appearances suggest otherwise.</p><hr><h2><strong>Faith as Inner Certainty</strong></h2><p>The New Testament summarises Abraham’s confidence in God’s promise with stunning clarity:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to be dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s body; Still, he did not give up faith in the undertaking of God, but was made strong by faith, giving glory to God, And being certain that God was able to keep his word.”</em><br>
— Romans 4:19–21</p>
</blockquote><p>Abraham’s aged mindset said no. The world said no. Logic said no. But Abraham said yes. He <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">persisted in the assumption that what was promised was already true</a>. This is what Neville meant when he taught that faith is “loyalty to the unseen reality.”</p><hr><h2><strong>Isaac: The Manifestation of Cleaving and Joy</strong></h2><p>The child of promise is named <strong>Isaac</strong>, meaning <em>"he laughs."</em> On the surface, the name reflects Sarah's laughter—her disbelief turning into joy. But beneath that, Isaac represents the first manifestation of <strong>faith joined to imagination</strong>—a result born from union with the unseen.</p><p>His name is deeply tied to the <strong>cleaving principle</strong> described in Genesis 2:24:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh.”</em><br>
— Genesis 2:24</p>
</blockquote><p>This “joining” symbolises more than marriage. It is the act of mental union—where your conscious desire cleaves to the subconscious assumption. Isaac is born from this fusion. He is joy made flesh. When desire (Abraham) unites with inner conviction (Sarah), the result is a living manifestation. Isaac represents the <strong>cleaving of man to his ideal</strong>, a spiritual union that produces fruit in the outer world.</p><hr><h2><strong>The Sacrifice of Isaac — Surrender Without Separation</strong></h2><p>In Genesis 22, Abraham is asked to sacrifice Isaac:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And he said, Take your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah, and give him as a burned offering on one of the mountains of which I will give you knowledge.”</em><br>
— Genesis 22:2</p>
</blockquote><p>This is not a demand for death—it is a demand for surrender. Abraham’s willingness shows that true faith is never attached to form. He trusts the promise so fully that he knows even if Isaac is taken, the fulfilment remains.</p><p>Neville saw this as a profound symbol of <strong>detachment from the outer form of desire</strong>—the ability to persist in faith without grasping at appearances. You give up control of how it happens and rest in the assumption that it <em>already is</em>.</p><hr><h2><strong>How to Manifest Like Abraham</strong></h2><p>Abraham’s life reveals the formula:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Receive the promise</strong> (a desire awakens)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leave behind the familiar</strong> (detach from old beliefs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cleave to the promise</strong> (fuse consciousness and assumption)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Let go of how it unfolds</strong> (sacrifice outcomes, not belief)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville calls this process “living in the end.” Abraham did not hope—he <em>believed</em>. He did not look to the world—he looked within.</p><hr><h2><strong>Final Reflection: The Cleaving of Faith to Imagination</strong></h2><p>Abraham’s faith is not a soft virtue—it is a radical act of mental persistence. He cleaves to what is unseen until it becomes visible. Isaac is not just a son; he is the laughter that arises when the unseen becomes seen.</p><p>To live like Abraham is to treat your inner world as real, your assumptions as law, and your imagination as God.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
