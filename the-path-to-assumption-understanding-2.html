<h1>Paul: Knowledge of a Man in Corinthians</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In <strong>2 Corinthians 12:1–6</strong>, Paul describes a shift in awareness. Through Neville Goddard’s teachings, we can understand this as living from a new assumption — a <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">new identity</a> that exists beyond our current limitations. These verses show how inner transformation happens when we remain committed to the state of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>2 Corinthians 12:1</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“As it is, it is not good for me to take pride: but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul reminds us that spiritual growth isn’t about showing off. Instead, progress happens through <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">inner experience</a> — our imagined end. These “visions and revelations” are the assumptions we accept as real. When we look within and assume what we desire, we rise above external appearances.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>2 Corinthians 12:2 NIV</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I have knowledge of a man in Christ… who was taken up to the third heaven.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="genesis-126-man.html">“man in Christ”</a> originates from Genesis 1:26, and represents the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">new identity</a> we choose by assumption. It doesn’t matter how the experience appears — whether physical or imagined — because the imagination <strong>is</strong> the creative power. The “third heaven” symbolises the fulfilment of the desired state — where the assumption is fully accepted as true.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>2 Corinthians 12:3–4 KJV</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And I have knowledge of such a <b>man</b>… taken up into Paradise… which <b>man</b> may not put into words.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> here is the new state of consciousness. When we live from our assumption, we <a href="eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">enter “Paradise” — the realised imagination</a>. The “secret things” refer to how imagination works silently and invisibly. The old identity cannot understand the process, but the new identity lives in its results.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>2 Corinthians 12:5</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“On account of such a one I will have glory: for myself I will take no glory…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul chooses not to identify with the old version of himself. He “glories” only in the new state — the assumption. This is Neville’s teaching: do not argue for your limitations. Honour the new you, even if nothing has changed outwardly yet.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>2 Corinthians 12:6</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For if I had a mind to take glory to myself… I would be saying what is true…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul explains that declaring the new identity isn’t boasting — it’s simply affirming the truth of the assumption. There is no need to seek approval from others. The change will show itself automatically. The new state expresses itself in time.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>The Double Dreams: Joseph and “God Only Knows”</h3>
<p>Joseph’s repeated dreams show the importance of staying loyal to the desired end. Repetition builds belief.</p>
<p>Likewise, Paul repeating <em>“<a href="the-significance-of-god-knows-and-power.html">God only knows</a>”</em> reinforces that the subconscious (God) fulfils what we assume. We do not need to know how it will happen — we only keep accepting the new identity. When the assumption is the only reality, the result becomes inevitable.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Conclusion: Living From the Assumed State</h3>
<p>These verses reveal a practical message: inner identity determines outward experience. To “glory” in the assumption is to live from the end — without needing outside confirmation.</p>
<p>The “man in Christ” is the chosen identity, free from old limitations. When we stay faithful to this inner state, we rise into our own “third heaven” — the fulfilled desire. The transformation happens within first, and then expresses in the world.</p>
