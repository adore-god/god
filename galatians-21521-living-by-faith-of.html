<h1>Galatians: Christ Lives in Me</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>When reading Paul’s words in Galatians 2:15–21, many assume he is discussing salvation in terms of historical theology. However he is describing something far more intimate—a mystical transformation of the self. Through the lens of Neville Goddard’s teachings, this passage becomes a statement on the awakening of imagination as the true Christ within.</p>
<hr>
<h3>“Not Justified by the Works of the Law…”</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ…”</em><br>
— Galatians 2:16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul opens with a confession: outward obedience to rules and rituals—the “law”—cannot make us righteous. To Neville, this law represents all external systems: codes of behaviour, moral duties, religious traditions. It is the attempt to reach God from the outside in.</p>
<p>But God, as Neville boldly taught, is not outside at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Imagination is the very gateway of reality.”</em><br>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are justified—transformed—not by effort, but by <strong>faith in <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a></strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">, whom Neville identifies as <strong>the awakened imagination</strong></a>, the creative power within each person. Justification, then, is not about being judged righteous by God (as portrayed in the discourse of Job), but becoming <strong>conscious</strong> of your <a href="elohim-god.html">oneness within imagination</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>“Crucified with Christ”</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me…”</em><br>
— Galatians 2:20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To Neville, the <a href="label-crucifixion-series.html" class="noTag">crucifixion</a> is not a one-time event on a wooden cross. It is a <strong>spiritual fixation</strong>—the moment you <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume a new identity</a> so fully that the old self dies. You crucify the former you by abandoning old beliefs, limitations, and self-definitions, and <strong>nail yourself to the state you now claim to be</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The crucifixion is the fixation of an idea.”</em><br>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul is describing a rebirth. His old identity, shaped by striving and separation, is dead. He now lives from the state of union with imagination—Christ in him.</p>
<hr>
<h3>“The Life I Now Live… I Live by Faith”</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“…The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God…”</em><br>
— Galatians 2:20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not blind religious belief. It is a radical trust in <strong>unseen reality</strong>—in the felt experience of the wish fulfilled. Life is now directed by inner vision, not outer appearance. It is no longer governed by effort but by <strong>faith in the creative act of assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Neville often emphasised the distinction between appearances and assumptions. Faith, in his teaching (and the stories of <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a>), is the act of persistently imagining a new state until it becomes your reality.</p>
<p>You no longer walk according to what the world shows you. You walk according to what you have claimed and embodied in imagination.</p>
<hr>
<h3>“If Righteousness Came Through the Law…”</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If righteousness comes through the law, Christ died in vain.”</em><br>
— Galatians 2:21</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If transformation could come through outward observance alone, there would be no need for the <strong>inner rebirth</strong>. But Paul understands what Neville echoes: the true Christ is <em>not a historical figure to be worshipped from afar</em>, but the <strong><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">incarnate imagination</a></strong> within.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Christ in you, the hope of glory”</em><br>
— Colossians 1:27</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a> remains outside us—locked in history or doctrine—then he has “died in vain.” But when we awaken to the creative power of our own awareness, his death becomes our resurrection.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Living from the Inner Christ</h3>
<p>Galatians 2:15–21, when read symbolically, is the declaration of a man who has stopped striving and has started <strong>imagining</strong>. Paul has moved from outer religion to inner realisation. He has died to the law and now lives by the <strong>faith of Christ—the creative, redemptive power within.</strong></p>
<p>This is not the abandonment of God—it is the rediscovery of God as <strong>I AM</strong>, the indwelling presence Neville taught was the source of all creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“God became as I am, that I may be as He is.”</em><br>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To live by the faith of Christ is to accept that your inner world creates your outer world. It is to crucify the old self and rise in the likeness of the state you dare to assume. It is no longer you who live—but Christ—the awakened imagination—living through you.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html" class="noTag">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-paul-s-letters--galatians.html" class="noTag">Paul's Letters: Galatians</a></p>
