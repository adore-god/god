<h1>Oholah and Oholibah: Horses Emissions and the Baals</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Ezekiel 23 is one of the Bible’s most vivid and challenging chapters, depicting the sexual misconduct of two sisters—Oholah and Oholibah—through intense and unsettling metaphors. At first glance, the graphic imagery of “flesh like asses” and “issue like horses” (Ezekiel 23:20) can seem crude or shocking when interpreted literally. Yet, when understood through the psychological and spiritual framework taught by Neville Goddard, this story unfolds as a allegory about the misuse of the mind’s creative power and the divided nature of consciousness.</p><h2>Two Tents: Outer and Inner Mind</h2><p>In the original biblical context, Oholah represents <strong>Samaria</strong> and Oholibah <strong>Jerusalem</strong>. But Neville’s teachings encourage us to see them as symbolic states of mind.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Oholah</strong>, meaning “<a href="the-symbolism-of-tents-cities-and.html">Her Tent</a>,” signifies the <strong>outer mind</strong>—the surface consciousness that places its faith and identity in external powers, such as political alliances, material success, or public approval. This mind “plays the harlot” by worshipping the Baals—false gods representing anything outside our own creative power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oholibah</strong>, meaning “<a href="the-symbolism-of-tents-cities-and.html">My Tent is In Her</a>,” represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, dwelling within the outer tent yet often acting autonomously. Though the divine presence, the I AM, still resides within this inner tent, it too can fall into spiritual harlotry by reinforcing scattered, misguided loyalties and mental patterns inherited or adopted unconsciously.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This division between tents symbolises the conflict many experience within—the struggle between conscious awareness and subconscious habits, between focused faith and scattered attention.</p><h2>The Graphic Metaphor: Wasted Creative Energy</h2><p>The disturbing image of lovers “whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses” (Ezekiel 23:20) vividly portrays the <strong>misuse and dissipation of creative power</strong>.</p><p>In Neville’s teachings, horses symbolise the mind’s imagination—its tremendous power and ability to generate movement and change. However, when this energy is uncontrolled and scattered across many desires or fears, it becomes like wild horses running without reins—powerful but unproductive, leading to spiritual emptiness rather than fulfilment.</p><p>The “emission” or release of this energy reflects how mental focus, when directed at external Baals—wealth, status, opinions—becomes diluted and ineffective, leaving a fragmented, disempowered self.</p><h2>Spiritual Harlotry: Divided Allegiance and False Worship</h2><p>Throughout the chapter, both sisters are accused of “playing the harlot” with foreign gods and nations. Baal, meaning “lord” or “master” in Hebrew, symbolises <strong>false external authorities</strong> we mistakenly worship—anything outside the creative self, the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>.</p><p>This is spiritual adultery: giving power and faith to outward things rather than recognising and aligning with your inner divine authority. <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-baal-series.html">Beelzebub, or “Lord of the Flies</a>,” further underscores the decay and mental distraction caused by such divided focus—like flies buzzing over spiritual decay.</p><h2>The Divine Presence Within</h2><p>Despite the sisters’ corruption, the name Oholibah reminds us that <strong>“My Tent is In Her”</strong>—the divine I AM remains present within the subconscious mind, no matter how lost or distracted it seems. This presence is the ever-waiting creative force that can awaken and reclaim control when the individual chooses.</p><p>Neville emphasises that transformation begins with <strong>recognition and assumption</strong>: becoming aware of the divided state, and then deliberately shifting your inner assumption from scattered faith in the outside world to focused faith in your own I AM.</p><h2>From Fragmentation to Unity: Reclaiming Creative Power</h2><p>The key to overcoming this spiritual harlotry is to <strong><a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-baal-series.html">stop worshipping the Baals of the external world</a></strong> and reclaim the unity of your inner self. The creative energy once wasted becomes a powerful, focused force when consciously directed.</p><p>Through the Law of Assumption, you impress your subconscious with the new state: one of wholeness, faith, and control. As Neville said, “Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled.” This conscious shift “cleanses the tents” and ends the divided allegiance.</p><hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Ezekiel 23 is not merely a story about two wayward women—it is a symbolic map of the human psyche’s divided states. Oholah and Oholibah represent the outer and inner consciousness caught in spiritual harlotry—placing faith in false external masters rather than the divine self within.</p><p>The shocking imagery of “flesh like asses” and “issue like horses” illustrates the immense creative power scattered and wasted through misplaced focus. Yet, the presence of the divine “tent” within Oholibah reminds us that redemption and transformation are always possible.</p><p>By consciously reclaiming your inner tent, focusing your imagination, and assuming your true identity as the I AM, you stop spiritual harlotry and become the unified, creative force of your own life.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
