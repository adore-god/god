<h1>Abraham and the Tent Doorway</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<article> 
<p>In Genesis 18, Abraham sits at the <a href="unlocking-power-of-doors-neville.html">doorway</a> of his tent when three <a href="genesis-126-man.html">men</a> appear. This moment is more than an encounter; it symbolises the transition from one state of being to another. In Neville Goddard’s teachings, such a doorway represents the threshold between your current self and the fulfilled state you desire to enter.</p><blockquote>
<p>Genesis 4:7: "If you do well, will you not be lifted up? and if not, sin is waiting at the door, desiring to get control over you: but you are to get the mastery over it."</p>
</blockquote><p>This passage suggests that every moment offers a choice: to <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">remain in an old state or step forward into a new assumption</a>. The “door” symbolises the conscious decision point where you master your inner reactions and assumptions.</p><h2>Abraham’s Visitors: Faith in Action</h2><p>When Abraham receives the three men and hears the promise of Isaac, he stands at a spiritual doorway. Though Sarah laughs at the seeming impossibility of the promise, Abraham embodies unwavering faith — a complete acceptance of the promise as already true. Neville calls this the Law of Assumption: you must enter the state of the wish fulfilled and live from it, not merely think of it.</p><h2>The Doorway as a Portal to New Identity</h2><p>The tent’s doorway is a metaphysical symbol marking the shift from barrenness and doubt to fruitfulness and assurance. Abraham’s openness reflects his readiness to leave behind old assumptions and accept a new identity as the father of the promised son.</p><h2>Receptivity: Mastery at the Door</h2><blockquote>
<p>Genesis 4:7: "If you do well, will you not be lifted up? and if not, sin is waiting at the door, desiring to get control over you: but you are to get the mastery over it."</p>
</blockquote><p>This passage reminds us that the “door” is always the point of conscious choice, where our assumptions are either mastered or left to run unchecked. Abraham’s story shows how faith and receptivity at the door enable us to step into a new state, leaving behind any “sin” — any missing of the mark — that keeps us bound to an old reality.</p><h2>Assumption as the Key</h2><p>Abraham’s acceptance of Isaac’s promise illustrates the power of assumption over physical evidence. Despite the apparent barrenness, he chooses to see himself as already the father of many nations. Neville emphasises that this kind of inner conviction transforms reality.</p><h2>Legacy of the Doorway</h2><p>Abraham’s encounter at the tent door becomes a lasting teaching on moving from promise to fulfilment. His faith was not passive; it was an active, living assumption of a new state, even before any evidence appeared.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
</p><p>Abraham’s story at the doorway invites us to reflect: What doorway are we standing before today? Are we clinging to the old, or are we stepping into the new with unwavering faith? The choice at the door determines the world we walk into. By aligning with divine promise and assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, we pass through the door and give life to our highest desires.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
