<h1>Levi: “I AM Your Heritage” — The Inner Priesthood in Scripture</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In the Bible’s symbolic drama, <a href="levi-levites-aaron-and-jesus-symbolism.html">Levi</a> — the <a href="scrolls/label-jacob-s-twelve-son-s-and-tribes-series.html" class="noTag">third son and formative tribe</a> of Jacob and Leah — represents your inner priesthood: the part of you devoted to guarding and caring for your imagination, which is the true dwelling place of God.</p><blockquote>
<p>“This is what is to be done by the Levites: from twenty-five years old and over, they are to do the work of caring for the Tent of meeting.”<br>
<em>(Numbers 8:24, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The “Tent of Meeting” or tabernacle symbolises your imagination — the sacred space where your assumptions are formed. The Levite within you tends this inner sanctuary. While other aspects of mind look outward for results, Levi stays within, maintaining inner stillness and alignment. He watches over your assumptions and ensures they remain true to what you desire.</p><blockquote>
<p>“I AM your heritage and your part among the children of Israel.”<br>
<em>(Numbers 18:20, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The Levites had no external inheritance; their reward was the Lord Himself. Neville would interpret this as realising that your true inheritance is your “I AM” — your awareness of being. Nothing outside of you can compare to the power and wealth that lie in your ability to assume and feel yourself to be what you choose.</p><blockquote>
<p>“And of Levi he said, Give your Thummim and Urim to your true one...”<br>
<em>(Deuteronomy 33:8, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The <a href="the-urim-and-thummim-divine-guidance.html">Urim and Thummim</a> symbolise inner guidance — the intuitive knowing that precedes all visible proof. Neville taught that <a href="feeling-is-secret-unlocking-bliss.html">feeling is the secret</a>. It is this quiet conviction, not outer evidence, that guides the creative process.</p><blockquote>
<p>“They will be the teachers of your decisions to Jacob, and of your law to Israel...”<br>
<em>(Deuteronomy 33:10, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The Levites taught the law, which in Neville’s terms is the law of assumption: what you accept and persist in <a href="feeling-is-secret-unlocking-bliss.html">feeling as true</a> will become your experience. The Levite within you reminds you that you are always becoming what you consent to in imagination.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The priests, the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, are to have no part or heritage with <a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel</a>: the offerings of the Lord made by fire are their heritage.”<br>
<em>(Deuteronomy 18:1, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Instead of external possessions, the Levite “eats” from the altar — meaning you <a href="the-last-supper-neville-goddards.html">draw your sustenance</a> from the feeling of the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">wish fulfilled</a>. When you live from imagination, your true food is the inner conviction that your desire is already yours.</p><blockquote>
<p>“I will let them be parted in Jacob, and be scattered in <a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel</a>.”<br>
<em>(Genesis 49:7, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Jacob’s prophecy of Levi’s scattering can seem like a curse, but it is a hidden blessing. The Levites were later spread throughout Israel, symbolising that the principle of inner awareness is present in every part of your <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>. Wherever a thought or feeling arises, there is an opportunity to remember: “You become what you imagine.”</p><hr><h2>The Priesthood: Gathering Fragmented Consciousness</h2><p>The priesthood of Levi also symbolises the effort to gather and unify the scattered, fragmented parts of your mind. Through ritual, devotion, and careful tending of the inner sanctuary, the Levite attempts to bring together all conflicting assumptions and wandering beliefs — gathering them into a crude but earnest form of inner harmony and love.</p><p>This priestly function shows that even before full spiritual mastery, there is an impulse in you to collect and reconcile the broken pieces of self. Every ritual, every act of inner discipline, is a step towards healing the divided mind and leading it back to the singular awareness of “I AM.”</p><hr><h2>Levi: The Inner Priesthood of the Creative Self</h2><p>Through Neville’s interpretation, Levi is not a historical figure but a living principle within you — the part that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Guards the temple of your imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trusts that what you feel to be true will harden into fact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lives independently of outer conditions, drawing life from inner conviction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses intuition, not logic, to discern reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continually reminds you that assumption is destiny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeks to gather your fragmented mental states into unified focus.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Levite is your quiet, devoted inner priest, always tending the flame of your chosen state. Honouring this part of yourself means living with inner discipline and reverence, knowing that your whole world begins and ends at the altar of your imagination.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-moses-series.html" class="noTag">Moses Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-priesthood-series.html" class="noTag">Priesthood Series</a></p>
