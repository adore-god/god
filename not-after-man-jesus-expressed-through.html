<h1>Revealed in You: Jesus Expressed Through Inner Revelation</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Neville Goddard frequently referenced the writings of Paul to support one of his central teachings: that <strong>truth is not received from others&mdash;it is revealed from within</strong>. Few passages make this clearer than Paul&rsquo;s statement in <strong>Galatians 1:11&ndash;12</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Galatians 1:11&ndash;12 (KJV)</strong><br/>
"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.<br/>
For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Galatians 1:12 (BBE)</strong><br/>
"To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood."</p>
</blockquote><h3>Paul&rsquo;s Inner Revelation</h3><p>Neville interpreted this as Paul declaring that his message was not learned through external teaching, but came through a <strong>direct, inner experience</strong>. This fit squarely with Neville&rsquo;s consistent message that <strong>the Bible is a psychological drama taking place in the imagination of man</strong>.</p><p>In the lecture <em>&ldquo;The Revealer&rdquo;</em>, Neville remarks:</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Paul said: &lsquo;I did not receive it from a man, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.&rsquo; He experienced it. It was not something he heard from another.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>Paul was not passing on a tradition&mdash;he was describing the <strong>awakening of Christ within</strong>.</p><h3>Jesus is Revealed <em>in You</em>, Not Taught <em>to You</em></h3><p>Neville often emphasised that even Scripture itself insists that Jesus must be revealed <strong>in you</strong>&mdash;not presented to you externally.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Galatians 1:16 (KJV)</strong><br/>
<em>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This verse powerfully confirms Neville&rsquo;s position: the gospel Paul preached was based on a <strong>first-hand inner event</strong>, not second-hand instruction.</p><p>In <em>&ldquo;Christ Unveiled&rdquo;</em>, Neville elaborates:</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He reveals His Son <em>in you</em>. That&rsquo;s what Scripture says. He doesn&rsquo;t reveal Him <em>to</em> you&mdash;as though He&rsquo;s on the outside. He reveals His Son <em>in you</em>. You experience the entire drama <em>within yourself</em>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville&rsquo;s core message&mdash;that <strong>Christ is your own wonderful human imagination</strong>&mdash;finds reinforcement here. The Bible isn&rsquo;t contradicting him; it&rsquo;s confirming that the path to truth is <strong>experiential, psychological, and inward</strong>.</p><h3>The Crucifixion as Inner Drama</h3><p>Neville also frequently drew attention to <strong>Galatians 3:1</strong>, where Paul reminds his audience that they themselves had seen the crucifixion&mdash;not as an external history lesson, but as an <strong>inner revelation</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Galatians 3:1 (ESV)</strong><br/>
<em>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville asserted that Paul was not referring to a physical event witnessed in Jerusalem, but to an <strong>internal vision</strong> experienced by the Galatians.</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The crucifixion is the fixation of an idea,&rdquo; Neville said.<br/>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s when the truth is nailed in you so firmly, it cannot be shaken.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p>For Neville, this moment of being &ldquo;crucified with Christ&rdquo; represents the <strong>fixing of your identity</strong>&mdash;when you fully accept that <em>&ldquo;I AM&rdquo; is God</em>, and that <strong>your imagination creates reality</strong>.</p><p>Paul continues this line of thought with a sharp rebuke that again resonates with Neville&rsquo;s teachings:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Galatians 3:3 (ESV)</strong><br/>
<em>Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To Neville, this was <strong>Paul cautioning against turning back to external laws and effort</strong> after having begun the journey through inner revelation. Once the <strong>spirit of imagination</strong> has stirred the transformation, it cannot be completed through outward rituals or the opinions of others. The work must be carried through <em>from within</em>.</p><h3>The Gospel Is Within</h3><p>Paul&rsquo;s gospel, Neville said, was not about obeying laws or honouring dogma. It was the telling of an <strong>inner transformation</strong>&mdash;a shift from identifying as a separate being to recognising oneself as the divine in expression.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The gospel is not taught&mdash;it is <strong>revealed</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus Christ is not a person&mdash;it is a <strong>state of awareness.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The crucifixion is not historical&mdash;it is the <strong>inner fixation of truth</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Awakening Through Imagination</h3><p>At the heart of it all is <strong>imagination</strong>&mdash;Neville&rsquo;s term for God in action. The revelation Paul describes happens the moment you experience that your <strong>own awareness of being is the creative power</strong> behind all things.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t philosophy&mdash;it&rsquo;s personal. It isn&rsquo;t passed down&mdash;it&rsquo;s <strong>unfolded within</strong>.</p><hr/><h3>In Summary:</h3><p>Neville&rsquo;s interpretation of Galatians isn&rsquo;t speculative or anti-scriptural&mdash;it&rsquo;s deeply anchored in Paul&rsquo;s own words. Paul&rsquo;s claim that Christ was revealed <em>in him</em> aligns perfectly with Neville&rsquo;s central message: that the truth of who you are will never be taught to you from without, but must awaken <strong>from within</strong>. And when it does, <strong>you will know that your imagination is the Son of God</strong>.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
