<h1>Revealed in You: Jesus Expressed Through Inner Revelation</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Neville Goddard frequently referenced the writings of Paul to support one of his central teachings: that <strong>truth is not received from others—it is revealed from within</strong>. Few passages make this clearer than Paul’s statement in <strong>Galatians 1:11–12</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Galatians 1:11–12 (KJV)</strong><br>
"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.<br>
For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Galatians 1:12 (BBE)</strong><br>
"To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood."</p>
</blockquote><h2>Paul’s Inner Revelation</h2><p>Neville interpreted this as Paul declaring that his message was not learned through external teaching, but came through a <strong>direct, inner experience</strong>. This fit squarely with Neville’s consistent message that <strong>the Bible is a psychological drama taking place in the imagination of man</strong>.</p><p>In the lecture <em>“The Revealer”</em>, Neville remarks:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Paul said: ‘I did not receive it from a man, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.’ He experienced it. It was not something he heard from another.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Paul was not passing on a tradition—he was describing the <strong>awakening of Christ within</strong>.</p><h2>Jesus is Revealed <em>in You</em>, Not Taught <em>to You</em></h2><p>Neville often emphasised that even Scripture itself insists that Jesus must be revealed <strong>in you</strong>—not presented to you externally.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Galatians 1:16 (KJV)</strong><br>
<em>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This verse powerfully confirms Neville’s position: the gospel Paul preached was based on a <strong>first-hand inner event</strong>, not second-hand instruction.</p><p>In <em>“Christ Unveiled”</em>, Neville elaborates:</p><blockquote>
<p>“He reveals His Son <em>in you</em>. That’s what Scripture says. He doesn’t reveal Him <em>to</em> you—as though He’s on the outside. He reveals His Son <em>in you</em>. You experience the entire drama <em>within yourself</em>.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville’s core message—that <strong>Christ is your own wonderful human imagination</strong>—finds reinforcement here. The Bible isn’t contradicting him; it’s confirming that the path to truth is <strong>experiential, psychological, and inward</strong>.</p><h2>The Crucifixion as Inner Drama</h2><p>Neville also frequently drew attention to <strong>Galatians 3:1</strong>, where Paul reminds his audience that they themselves had seen the crucifixion—not as an external history lesson, but as an <strong>inner revelation</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Galatians 3:1 (ESV)</strong><br>
<em>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville asserted that Paul was not referring to a physical event witnessed in Jerusalem, but to an <strong>internal vision</strong> experienced by the Galatians.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The crucifixion is the fixation of an idea,” Neville said.<br>
“It’s when the truth is nailed in you so firmly, it cannot be shaken.”</p>
</blockquote><p>For Neville, this moment of being “crucified with Christ” represents the <strong>fixing of your identity</strong>—when you fully accept that <em>“I AM” is God</em>, and that <strong>your imagination creates reality</strong>.</p><p>Paul continues this line of thought with a sharp rebuke that again resonates with Neville’s teachings:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Galatians 3:3 (ESV)</strong><br>
<em>Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To Neville, this was <strong>Paul cautioning against turning back to external laws and effort</strong> after having begun the journey through inner revelation. Once the <strong>spirit of imagination</strong> has stirred the transformation, it cannot be completed through outward rituals or the opinions of others. The work must be carried through <em>from within</em>.</p><h2>The Gospel Is Within</h2><p>Paul’s gospel, Neville said, was not about obeying laws or honouring dogma. It was the telling of an <strong>inner transformation</strong>—a shift from identifying as a separate being to recognising oneself as the divine in expression.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The gospel is not taught—it is <strong>revealed</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus Christ is not a person—it is a <strong>state of awareness.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The crucifixion is not historical—it is the <strong>inner fixation of truth</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>Awakening Through Imagination</h2><p>At the heart of it all is <strong>imagination</strong>—Neville’s term for God in action. The revelation Paul describes happens the moment you experience that your <strong>own awareness of being is the creative power</strong> behind all things.</p><p>This isn’t philosophy—it’s personal. It isn’t passed down—it’s <strong>unfolded within</strong>.</p><hr><h2>In Summary:</h2><p>Neville’s interpretation of Galatians isn’t speculative or anti-scriptural—it’s deeply anchored in Paul’s own words. Paul’s claim that Christ was revealed <em>in him</em> aligns perfectly with Neville’s central message: that the truth of who you are will never be taught to you from without, but must awaken <strong>from within</strong>. And when it does, <strong>you will know that your imagination is the Son of God</strong>.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
