<h1>The Unjust And Unforgiving Steward </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Neville Goddard's framework, the parable of the <strong>Unforgiving Steward</strong> (found in <strong>Luke 16:1–13</strong>) can be interpreted symbolically as a lesson on <strong>consciousness</strong>, <strong>imagination</strong>, and the <strong>law of forgiveness</strong>. Here’s how Neville might approach it:</p>
<h3><strong>The Setting: The Steward and the Master</strong></h3>
<p>The steward in this parable represents the <strong>imagination</strong> or <strong>subconscious mind</strong>. The master, being the one who owns everything, symbolises the <strong>higher self</strong> or <strong>divine consciousness</strong>, the true owner of all things. The steward, in his role, is tasked with managing or handling the affairs of the master, but instead of being faithful to his task, he mismanages his duties. This suggests that the subconscious mind (the steward) is often misdirected or misused in our own lives, as it is not always directed with the clarity of purpose that the higher self (the master) requires.</p>
<h3><strong>The Steward’s Debt</strong></h3>
<p>The steward owes a great debt to the master, symbolising the <strong>unresolved past</strong> or <strong>unforgiven thoughts</strong>. This debt can be seen as the burden of past beliefs, fears, or negative emotions that have not yet been released or forgiven. According to Neville, this debt is symbolic of the <strong>false self</strong>, the self created by conditioning, limited beliefs, and past experiences.</p>
<p>The steward’s inability to repay the debt illustrates the <strong>struggle of the human condition</strong>, where people often feel weighed down by the past and unable to manifest their true desires or step into the fullness of their divine nature. In Neville’s interpretation, this debt is <strong>impossible to settle through conscious effort alone</strong>—it requires an inner transformation of consciousness.</p>
<h3><strong>The Steward's Actions: Forgiveness and Adjustment</strong></h3>
<p>Rather than being dismissed immediately, the steward decides to take action. He goes to those who owe the master money and <strong>reduces their debts</strong>, even though the master never directly asks him to. This act of <strong>forgiveness</strong> can be understood as the steward (the imagination) choosing to change his perception of the past, forgiving the debts, and adjusting the way he has been thinking about them.</p>
<p>In Neville's terms, the steward’s decision to forgive and reduce the debts is <strong>the act of changing one's mental attitude</strong>. The debts are forgiven through a shift in perception, much like how we must change our thoughts and beliefs to transform our lives. When we forgive—whether it’s forgiving ourselves, others, or the situations that have hurt us—we shift our consciousness to a new state, one of greater freedom and alignment with divine potential. This is akin to Neville’s teaching that we must forgive the past (and its limiting beliefs) to create a new and better future.</p>
<h3><strong>The Master’s Response</strong></h3>
<p>When the master hears of the steward’s actions, he commends him for acting shrewdly, even though his actions were self-serving. This represents a <strong>realisation that the subconscious mind (the steward) has finally learned the power of forgiveness</strong>. Though the steward's actions are imperfect, the fact that he has chosen to act differently reflects the divine principle that forgiveness and shifting perceptions are the keys to transforming consciousness and manifesting a new reality.</p>
<p>Neville often speaks of <strong>forgiveness as a tool for inner transformation</strong>—by forgiving the old mental states, we clear the way for new manifestations. The master’s approval of the steward’s actions symbolises the affirmation that shifting from negative to positive, from limitation to abundance, is the correct way to align oneself with divine law.</p>
<h3><strong>The Symbolism of the Unforgiving Steward</strong></h3>
<p>At a deeper level, the story is about the <strong>consequences of holding on to old beliefs</strong>—the unforgiven debts of the subconscious. The <strong>unforgiving steward</strong> represents a mind that clings to past mistakes, guilt, and resentment, thus perpetuating lack and limitation in one’s life. When we fail to forgive, whether it’s forgiving ourselves or others, we remain bound to old conditions, unable to manifest a greater reality.</p>
<p>However, the story also highlights the power of <strong>forgiving and releasing</strong>—by choosing to shift your thoughts, you free yourself from the debts of the past and allow the imagination to create a more positive future. The steward’s action of reducing the debts is a call to <strong>change your mental states</strong>, to stop holding onto outdated perceptions and instead embrace the higher consciousness of divine potential.</p>
<h3><strong>Practical Application</strong></h3>
<p>In practical terms, this parable teaches us to recognise that we are <strong>the stewards of our own consciousness</strong>. We have the power to choose the thoughts, beliefs, and mental states that govern our lives. Just as the steward adjusts the debts, we too can <strong>adjust our thoughts and beliefs</strong>, forgiving the past and shifting our consciousness to one of abundance and possibility.</p>
<p>By forgiving old mental states (represented by the debts) and <strong>aligning with the divine "I AM"</strong>, we can manifest the desires of our hearts, just as the master ultimately rewards the steward. The steward's forgiveness of the debts represents the <strong>spiritual transformation</strong> that happens when we release our attachment to old, limiting beliefs and allow new, higher truths to take their place.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The parable of the <strong>unforgiving steward</strong>, when interpreted through Neville Goddard’s lens, is not just about a steward and his master—it’s a lesson in <strong>spiritual awakening and inner transformation</strong>. The debt represents the burden of past beliefs, and the forgiveness of those debts is symbolic of <strong>changing your consciousness</strong> and <strong>aligning with divine truth</strong>. By letting go of the past and embracing the present moment, we unlock the creative power of our imagination, which is the key to manifestation. The story calls us to be like the steward who chooses to forgive the debts, releasing the past and allowing for a new life to emerge.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
