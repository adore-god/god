</p>

<p>As you begin, allow every previous interpretation of the Bible to fall away, for what you will learn here restores Scripture as a revelation of your own consciousness. Its contrasting pairs — like Cain and Abel, and Hagar and Sarah — reveal recurring patterns: Abel, like the <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of Life</a>, represents the creative, enriched state of being itself being taught; Cain, like the <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</a>, represents everyday consciousness limited by the world. These patterns show the divide between the ordinary mind and the expanded state the Law of Assumption prompts you to embody.</p>


<p>In Genesis 1:1 and Exodus 3:14, God is named 'Judges' and 'Rulers' [of] 'I AM that I AM', followed in Luke 17:21 KJV with

<blockquote>
"The kingdom of God is within you" — .
</blockquote>
<p>
If the <a href="el/bible-kingdom-structure.html">kingdom of God</a> is within you, and a kingdom has kings, rulers, <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">lords</a>, judges and laws, then the people and events in the Bible are not external but internal. 
They are personified movements in consciousness, not records of history.
</p>
<p>
Genesis lays the foundation of these principles, showing how creation begins within — as imagination, as thought, as desire — before it takes form outwardly.
</p>
<p>
The Bible is a psychological drama taking place within the reader’s own mind, where every character symbolises a <a href="elohim-god.html">state of self-perception</a>. These figures reflect inner conversations — beliefs, doubts, and desires — that chart the journey of self-awareness. They show the mind learning to apply the law of assumption, gathering its scattered aspects into unity through love. The narrative of the Bible is the <a href="eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">psychological return to Eden - that is pleasure and delight</a></p>
<p>From the opening of Genesis, the Bible defines itself though it's <a class="redA" href="el/what-the-bible-teaches-you.html"><span class="red">personalised books of identities and mental postures</span></a>, and through symbols, portraying the <a class="redA" href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html"><span class="red">head as a house to reveal the workings of the mind</span></a>. These are the key Bible verses behind <a href="only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard’s</a> core teachings. <span class="red">It is crucial to grasp these concepts at the outset. The entire narrative connects back to them, unveiling a profound mystery</span>. Here are the premises to help the reader begin interpreting Scripture through it's intended narrative:</p>
<h2 class="def">THE DEFINITION OF GOD: <small>Genesis 1:1</small></h2>
<div class="bible-quote">“In the beginning God created…”</div>
<p>The Hebrew word rendered 'God' is <a href="elohim-god.html" target="_blank"><em>Elohim</em></a>, a plural term meaning judges, rulers, and powers. It symbolises the manifold aspects of your mind and imagination at work. <a href="wheels-within-wheels-symbolism-of-inner.html">Ezekiel’s “wheels within wheels</a>,” full of eyes, symbolise the self-perceiving and ever-revolving movements of self-perception. The <a href="twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">twelve sons, twelve tribes, and twelve disciples</a> are personified examples of these powers convening to support the assumption. </p>
<a class="read-more-link" href="elohim-god.html">Read more on this here.</a>
<h2 class="def">TIMELINE OF EVENTS:</h2>
<div class="bible-quote">“The law of Assumption as it permeates and develops in conscious awareness”</div>
<p>Here is a summarised timeline of events as the law of Assumption permeates and develops in the mind through the narrative of scripture.</p>
<a class="read-more-link" href="the-law-timeline.html">Read more on this here.</a>
<h2 class="def">IMAGINATION AS THE SEED OF LIFE: <small>Genesis 1:11</small></h2>
<p>The <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a> of every experience is planted in imagination. everything reproduces after its kind because the seed is in itself—a direct metaphor for how imagination creates reality. It's the first mention of the <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">two trees</a> in the <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-eden-series.html">Garden of Eden</a>.</p>
<a class="read-more-link" href="genesis-111-seed.html">Read more on this here.</a>
<h2 class="def">MAN AS INDIVIDUAL PERCEPTION OF SELF: <small>Genesis 1:26</small></h2>
<div class="bible-quote">“God said, Let Us make <a href="genesis-126-man.html" target="_blank">man in Our image</a>.”</div>
<p>Imagination is the union of self-perception and imaginative aspects of mind. The "judges", "rulers" and "powers" of your mind named <a href="https://god.thway.uk/elohim-god.html">God</a>, convene to create your perception of self. "<a href="genesis-126-man.html">Man</a>" refers to your self-concept — who you are <i><b>aware of being</b></i> — not a physical form. Any male or female character in the Bible is a <b>psychological concept of your mind</b>.</p>
<a class="read-more-link" href="genesis-126-man.html">Read more on this here.</a>
<h2 class="def">WOMAN AS THE RESPONSE TO SELF-PERCEPTION: <small>Genesis 2:23</small></h2>
<p>"Woman," called forth by <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>, symbolises your externalised world, every condition and event shaped by what you have accepted as true within.

The reflective, remembering mind <a href="genesis-126-man.html">drawn from the inherent sense of self — the 'I AM that I AM'</a>. Acceptance and mastery gives birth to new states and circumstances.</p>
<a class="read-more-link" href="genesis-223-woman.html">Read more on this here.</a>
<h2 class="def">LOVE: <small>Genesis 2:24</small></h2>
<div class="bible-quote">
Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh</div> 
<p>One of the most important verses. Here begins the symbolism of love, joining, and marriage within the mind, upon which the rest of the Bible narrative rests.</p>
<a class="read-more-link" href="genesis-224-love.html">Read more on this here.</a>
<h2 class="def">SIN: <small>Genesis 4:4-7</small></h2>
  “And the <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Lord was <i>pleased</i></a> with Abel's offering.....But in Cain and his offering he had <b>no pleasure</b>. And Cain was <b>angry</b>”
  <p>Sin is first defined here as the difference between imagining delightfully and negatively.</p>
<a class="read-more-link" href="genesis-47-sin.html">Read more on this here.</a>
<h2 class="def">"I AM": <small>Exodus 3:14</small></h2>
<div class="bible-quote"><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM THAT WHICH I AM”</a></div>
<p>God is your “I AM” — the awareness of being — seated and conceived in imagination.</p>
<a class="read-more-link" href="exodus-314-i-am.html">Read more on this here.</a>

<h2 class="def">Ask, Believe, Receive<br>
<small></small></h2>
<div class="bible-quote">"And whatever you ask for in prayer, if you have faith, you will receive it.” — Matthew 21:22</div>
<p>Ask, believe, receive describes an inner process, not a request to an external God. To ask is to form a desire and turn away from old assumptions. To believe is to accept that desire as already fulfilled and remain loyal to that state. To receive is the inevitable result: the inner assumption expresses itself outwardly.

<h2 class="def">The Teachers of the Law: <br>
<small>Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Judah</small></h2>
<div class="bible-quote"></div>
<p>Their stories reveal the steps of manifestation: Faith, Persistence, Imagination, and Praise. Aligned symbolically with the four Gospels, Ezekiel’s vision, and enacted by Jesus, they show how assumption becomes creation.</p>
