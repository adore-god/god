<h1>Judah: Lion and Sceptre</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<img alt="Lion Sphinx" src="images/wp/lion.webp">
<blockquote>“Judah is a lion’s whelp... the sceptre shall not depart from Judah.” — Genesis 49:9–10
</blockquote>

<p><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Judah</a>, whose name means <em>praise</em> (Hebrew: <em>Yehudah</em>), stands at the heart of biblical symbolism as the psychological state of praise. Praise is more than gratitude or outward expression — it is the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">living, creative current that animates desire into being</a>.</p>

<p>In Scripture, praise functions as a force of dominion, particularly in Judah’s blessing and in the poetic intimacy of the Song of Solomon. Read through Neville Goddard’s teachings, Judah represents the conscious act of assuming and sustaining the state of the fulfilled wish — not tentatively, but with inner authority.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Praise as Creative Dominion</h2>

<p>Praise is not flattery or emotional excess; it is recognition of an inner reality already accepted as true. When you praise, you do not ask — you affirm. This is the “I AM” awareness expressed as certainty: a creative act that enthrones a chosen state within consciousness.</p>

<p>Neville taught that feeling is the secret. Praise is the feeling-tone that declares, “It is done,” before any outer confirmation appears. It is not a reaction to evidence, but the cause of it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Lion: A Dominant Feeling</h2>

<p><a href="judahs-blessing-and-song-of-solomon.html">Jacob’s blessing over Judah</a> in Genesis 49 presents him as a lion’s whelp. When read psychologically, this image describes not an external animal or historical power, but a dominant inner feeling.</p>

<p>In Genesis, Adam names the animals. This act is symbolic: to name is to define, and the animals represent the various moods, impulses, and emotional states moving within consciousness. The lion, then, signifies a feeling that dominates all others — a governing mood.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, you have gone up... and as a lion, who shall rouse him?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lion of <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Judah</a> is a feeling that has been consciously named and assumed. It does not react, chase, or strain. It rests. This is the emotional state of the wish fulfilled — settled, unprovoked, and unmoved by contradiction.</p>

<p>In Neville’s language, this is a state that refuses displacement. Doubt may arise, appearances may challenge it, but the dominant feeling remains intact. Other moods fall beneath it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Ezekiel 19: When the Lion Is Fed by Fear</h2>

<p>Ezekiel 19 is introduced as a lamentation — a mourning over lost inner rulership. This immediately marks a contrast with Judah’s lion.</p>

<blockquote>
“Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, and say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.” — Ezekiel 19:1–2
</blockquote>

<p>Psychologically, the lioness represents the originating conditioning of the mind — what <a href="genesis-224-love.html">Scripture symbolises as “mother and father” - a fundamental principle</a>. These are not literal parents here, but formative beliefs, emotional habits, and inherited reactions that raise dominant feeling-states unconsciously.</p>

<p>The young lions grow strong, learn to tear prey, and devour men. This describes a powerful mood that feeds on fear, opposition, and struggle. It dominates — but through reaction rather than assumption.</p>

<p>Unlike Judah’s lion, which rests in certainty, Ezekiel’s lions roam and seize. They must continually feed in order to survive. Because they are sustained by fear and resistance, they cannot remain sovereign.</p>

<p>The lamentation continues as these lions are captured, chained, and brought down. Symbolically, this shows that any dominant feeling rooted in fear eventually collapses. A state maintained by reaction is always vulnerable to circumstance.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 19, then, is not condemning power, but misdirected power. It reveals what happens when “mother and father” — conditioning and emotional reflex — are allowed to govern the inner world. Such states tear down rather than build.</p>

<p>The contrast is deliberate: Judah’s lion is named consciously through praise; Ezekiel’s lion is raised unconsciously through fear. One rules by inner agreement. The other ends in lamentation.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Sceptre: Authority of Sustained Feeling</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“The sceptre shall not depart from Judah.” — Genesis 49:10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sceptre symbolises <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">continuous authority of the I AM</a> — not a momentary decision, but sustained inner government. To hold the sceptre is to maintain the chosen feeling-state without surrendering it to appearances.</p>

<p>Praise here is disciplined. It is the ongoing agreement with the end already assumed, the refusal to let attention drift back into lesser, fear-fed moods.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Praise in the Song of Solomon</h2>

<p>The Song of Solomon expresses Judah’s dominion through intimate declaration. The Bride and Beloved do not negotiate love; they assert identity and union:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I AM my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine.” — Song 6:3<br><br> 
“My beloved is mine, and I AM his.” — Song 2:16</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This language is not hopeful but declarative. Love is assumed as present fact. It is the language of a settled feeling.</p>

<p>Here, praise is emotional certainty — the same lion-like dominance expressed through union rather than force.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Praise in the Psalms: Feeling Given Voice</h2>

<p>The Psalms are <a href="to-choir-master-what-it-really-means-in.html">addressed to the inner choir</a>, and to show praise as feeling made audible — not to persuade God, but to stabilise consciousness:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness.” — Psalm 7:17<br><br> 
“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.” — Psalm 150:6</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are proclamations of already-claimed victory. Praise becomes the atmosphere of the assumed state — the breath of dominion.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Living the Praise of Judah</h2>

<p><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">To embody Judah is to allow a single, consciously chosen feeling to rule within</a>. The lion is that feeling — calm, assured, and immovable. The sceptre is sustained attention. Praise is the emotional confirmation that the state is already yours.</p>

<p>Manifestation is not effort, but government. You rule by mood. You reign by feeling.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion: The Lion of Judah Within</h2>

<p>The Lion of Judah is not external power, but inner authority — a feeling named, assumed, and maintained.</p>

<p>Ezekiel’s lamentation warns of what happens when fear-fed conditioning dominates. Judah’s praise shows the alternative: conscious dominion through assumption.</p>

<p>When praise becomes your governing mood, you no longer chase outcomes. You rest in certainty. And the world, as ever, rearranges itself in obedience to that feeling.</p>
