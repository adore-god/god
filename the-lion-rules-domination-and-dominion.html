<h1>Judah: Lion and Sceptre</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<img src="images/wp/lion.webp" alt="Lion Sphinx"><blockquote><p>“Judah is a lion’s whelp... the sceptre shall not depart from Judah.” — Genesis 49:9–10</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Judah</a>, whose name means <em>praise</em> (Hebrew: <em>Yehudah</em>), stands at the heart of biblical symbolism as the psychological state of praise. Praise is more than simple gratitude or outward expression — it is the<a href="genesis-224-love.html"> living, creative current that animates desire into being.</a></p>
<p>In the Bible, praise appears as a powerful force of dominion, especially in Judah’s blessing and in the rich poetic language of the Song of Solomon. When read through Neville Goddard’s teachings, Judah represents the conscious act of assuming and maintaining the state of the fulfilled wish, boldly and reverently.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Praise as Creative Dominion</h2>
<p>Praise is not flattery or shallow emotional response; it is a sacred recognition of the inner reality already chosen. When you praise, you do not beg or bargain — you affirm and enthrone. This is the “I AM” awareness in full expression: a creative act that crowns your chosen state with authority.</p>
<p>Neville often taught that feeling is the secret. Praise is the inner song that declares, “It is done,” even before any outer evidence appears. In this sense, praise is not a request but a sovereign decree.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Lion: Boldness and Dominance</h2>
<p>Jacob’s blessing over Judah in Genesis 49 reveals him as a lion’s whelp — a symbol of courage, strength, and royal authority. The lion is not passive; it moves with unwavering confidence, certain of its place as ruler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, you have gone up... and as a lion, who shall rouse him?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lion image captures the essence of bold assumption. When you truly assume a state, you do so as a lion: assertive, fearless, and unapologetically dominant in imagination.</p>
<p>In Neville’s language, this is the refusal to entertain doubt — the quiet, inner roar that establishes your chosen reality as fact. You do not plead with the outer world; you command inwardly, and the world mirrors your decree.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Sceptre: Authority in Assumption</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The sceptre shall not depart from Judah.” — Genesis 49:10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sceptre, a symbol of rulership and unbroken authority, shows that praise and assumption are not temporary acts but ongoing states. To hold the sceptre is to continually live from the end — to keep your focus fixed on the reality you have claimed, regardless of appearances.</p>
<p>Praise in this context is not only joyful; it is disciplined and sovereign. It sustains the creative act, much like a king upholding his reign through unwavering command.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Praise in the Song of Solomon</h2>
<p>The Song of Solomon reflects this deep praise and authority through the intimate dialogue of the Bride and Beloved. Their affirmations are not just words of affection but declarations of identity and union:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I AM my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine.” — Song 6:3<br>
“My beloved is mine, and I AM his.” — Song 2:16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These statements echo Judah’s praise — the felt experience of having already received and being at one with the desire fulfilled. The language of the Song is language of dominion: love is not sought anxiously but claimed as a present possession.</p>
<p>This mirrors Neville’s teaching that you must live from the state of the wish fulfilled, praising its reality inwardly and allowing that praise to animate all actions and reactions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Praise in the Psalms: Vocalised Dominion</h2>
<p>The Psalms offer another dimension of Judah’s spirit — praise as vocalised assumption and victory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high.” — Psalm 7:17<br>
“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.” — Psalm 150:6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are not mere hymns but expressions of already-claimed victory. They illustrate that praise is the continuous echo of having received — a deep, sustained knowing.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Living the Bold Praise of Judah</h2>
<p>To embody Judah is to move as a lion: clear, bold, and unwavering. The sceptre in your hand is your unyielding attention to the end state. Praise is your inner song of triumph, the gentle yet unshakeable roar of “I AM.”</p>
<p>Through Judah’s praise, the lion’s dominion, and the sceptre’s authority, we see that manifestation is not a passive waiting game. It is an active enthronement of your chosen reality.</p>
<p>In Neville’s terms, praise is not just celebration after the fact — it is the method of assuming the end and securing it. You live as if it were already true, and through this bold inner agreement, the outer world obediently aligns.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion: The Lion of Judah Within</h2>
<p>Judah’s story invites us to understand praise as dominion, not mere thanks. It is a creative act of bold assumption, the lion’s heart roaring silently within.</p>
<p>When you praise as Judah, you hold the sceptre, walk in royal certainty, and live from your chosen state as the only reality.</p>
<p>The bride in the Song of Solomon did not chase her beloved anxiously — she declared, “I AM my beloved’s,” and rested in that union. Likewise, in your own life, let praise be the lion’s roar of your assumption, the sceptre of your authority, and the song that sustains your chosen reality.</p>
