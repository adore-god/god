<h1>In My Father’s House Are Many Mansions</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<blockquote><p>“In my <a href="elohim-god.html">Father’s</a> house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>, there you may be also.” — John 14:2 KJV
</p></blockquote>
<p>This verse has long been read as a comforting promise of physical dwellings in the afterlife, but through Neville Goddard’s understanding of the Bible as personified aspects of mind, and <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">'head as the house'</a> allegory, its meaning is inward and immediate. The “Father’s house” is not a location beyond the sky—it is <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> itself, the dwelling place of the “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>", so precisely designed and built in the stories of <a href="the-dwelling-of-god-2-chronicles-61820.html">Solomon's Temple</a>. And the “many mansions” are states of being, inner rooms in the house of imagination, already existing and awaiting habitation through assumption.</p>
<p>The moment you assume a new <a href="genesis-126-man.html">self-concept</a>—when you feel yourself to be that which you <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">desire to be</a>—you enter a new mansion.</p>
<h2>The Mansions Are Inner Rooms of Awareness</h2>
<p>Neville teaches that all states already exist. The “many mansions” are these states, these <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">psychological dwellings within the house</a> of <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a>, which is your own imagination. You do not create them—they are prepared. You enter them by preparing yourself inwardly, by aligning with the feeling of being what you seek to be.</p>
<p>When <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> says, “I go to prepare a place for you,” he is not speaking of a literal journey, but of the inner movement of consciousness. Jesus symbolises the heightened imagination, going before you into the state you are to inherit.</p>
<p>To persist in an assumption is to walk the path to that mansion. To feel yourself there now is to live in it already.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All things exist in the human imagination.”<br/>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Elohim and the Architecture of Consciousness</h2>
<p>To deepen the symbolism, consider that in Genesis 1, the name for <a href="elohim-god.html">God is Elohim</a>—a plural noun meaning “gods,” “rulers,” “judges,” and “mighty powers” (Strong’s H430). Although plural in form, Elohim acts with singular authority. It points not to many gods, but to the many within the One—the multitude of powers and judgments alive within self-perception.</p>
<p>In Neville’s interpretation, Elohim symbolises the many faculties of imagination: the moods, assumptions, beliefs, and inner decrees that together construct your experience. The Father’s house, then, is Elohim in action—the pluralised power of imagination functioning through inner rulership.</p>
<p>When scripture mentions the ‘House of Jacob’ or the <a href="why-does-house-of-judah-appear-so-often.html">‘House of Judah,</a>’ it refers not to a physical family but to the <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">mind recognising the teachings and the guiding principle—the ‘father’—that shapes that particular understanding of the law</a>. In other words, it points to the mental ‘house’ or state in which the mind dwells.</p>
<p>Each mansion is a space carved by inner judgment. You move into them not by physical effort, but by accepting their truth internally. The house is already built. Your awareness chooses the room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your world is your self-pushed out.”<br/>
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To dwell in lack is to live in a lower mansion. To assume the reality of provision is to ascend. All states are fixed. The shift is in you.</p>
<h2>From Heaven and Earth to Room and Being</h2>
<p>In Genesis, when Elohim creates <a href="el/heaven.html">heaven</a> and earth, it is not a historical act, but the <a href="genesis-1-creation.html">beginning of awareness — the division of inner and outer experience.</a> “Heaven” is the unseen imagination, and “earth” is its manifestation. The same principle applies here: each mansion is first felt in imagination before it is seen as fact.</p>
<p>Even Solomon, in <a href="the-dwelling-of-god-2-chronicles-61820.html">dedicating the great temple</a>, declared, <em>“Behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?”</em> (1 Kings 8:27). He understood that the true <a href="the-dwelling-of-god-2-chronicles-61820.html">dwelling of God</a> was not a physical house but the vastness of consciousness itself. In the same way, Jesus’s “many mansions” are not material habitations but infinite states within the boundless house of “I AM.” The temple becomes a symbol of inner architecture, echoing Neville’s teaching that imagination alone contains the real sanctuaries of experience. You will notice throughout the <a href="the-symbolism-of-tents-cities-and.html">evolving Bible narrative that 'tents</a>', as metaphors for dwelling place as the mind, evolve into 'churches' when we get to Paul's letters.</p>
<p>So when Jesus says, “I go to prepare a place,” he speaks as Elohim—the inner judge, ruler, and creative faculty—making ready the experience by way of assumption.</p>
<p>And when he says, “where <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>, there you may be also,” it means that once a state has been realised in imagination, it is accessible to all. The prepared place is simply a state of consciousness made ready for you to enter. This is a parallel and a more refined repeat of the <a href="the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">law of identical harvest in Genesis</a>, where the Assumption is first made before any sign appears on earth.</p>
<h2>You Are Always in a Mansion</h2>
<p>Whether you are aware of it or not, you are always living in one of these mansions. To be rejected, poor, or unwanted is to occupy one room. To be accepted, prosperous, or beloved is to occupy another.</p>
<p>The power to shift is in you. The house is not changed—it remains what it always was: consciousness, imagination, Elohim. But the room you dwell in is changed by feeling. The “I AM” is the door to every mansion, and the Law of Assumption is the key.</p>
<p>To live as if your desire were already true is to walk the corridor into that state. You do not make the mansion—you abide in it.</p>
