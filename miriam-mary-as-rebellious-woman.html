<h1>Miriam: A Rebellious Woman</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Genesis 2:23, the “<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a>” is described as “bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,” revealing that every outward condition is born from the inner self. Neville Goddard taught that this is not a story about literal creation but a psychological law: the outer world (the “<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a>”) is drawn from and reflects the inner state (the “<a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>,” the conscious <a href="elohim-god.html">awareness of being</a>).</p><p>In this light, Miriam — sister of Moses and Aaron — symbolises the outer expression of our inner resistance. She is the embodiment of a state that has emerged from within but now stands in opposition to further transformation. Miriam represents the part of ourselves that takes shape from our assumptions but then becomes fixed, resisting new directions from our conscious "Moses."</p><h3>Miriam’s Challenge to Moses</h3><blockquote>
<p>"And Miriam and Aaron said against Moses because of the woman whom he had taken; for he had taken a Cushite woman."<br/>
(Numbers 12:1, BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, Miriam questions Moses’ authority and his union with the Cushite woman. This depicts the outer world (the "woman") challenging the conscious mind’s new assumption. Like the woman in Genesis who is named and called forth, Miriam arises from Moses’ (the conscious mind’s) state but now reflects an old attachment or hardened belief.</p><p>When the outer condition rebels, it mirrors an inner conflict: a divided house within consciousness. Miriam, as the "woman" drawn from Moses’ state, now stands in defiance rather than harmonious reflection.</p><h3>The Consequences of Division</h3><p>Miriam’s resulting leprosy symbolises the breakdown and isolation that occur when the outer condition (our world, our “woman”) is no longer in harmony with the conscious assumption. In Neville’s language, when your outer world is at odds with your inner conviction, stagnation and suffering appear. The “woman,” meant to faithfully express the "man’s" creative act, instead becomes an obstacle.</p><p>Miriam's exile outside the camp illustrates this severing — the outward experience becomes barren and disconnected when it no longer flows from a unified inner state.</p><h3>Restoration Through Intercession</h3><blockquote>
<p>"And Moses cried to the Lord, saying, Let my prayer be for her healing, O God."<br/>
(Numbers 12:13, BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>Moses’ intercession symbolises the conscious mind reasserting its creative authority, calling the outer condition (the "woman") back into alignment. When the conscious "man" lovingly reclaims and corrects the outer expression, harmony is restored. The “woman,” once rebellious, returns to her true role as faithful reflection and life-giver.</p><h3>The Evolution to Mary Magdalene</h3><p>As the biblical narrative unfolds, Miriam’s resistance finds its transformation in the figure of Mary Magdalene. Where Miriam stands as a "woman" in defiance, Mary Magdalene becomes the "<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a>" wholly aligned and receptive. She is "bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" in her purest form — an outer condition that willingly mirrors the conscious mind’s chosen state.</p><p>Mary Magdalene embodies the perfected "<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a>" principle: no longer resisting but standing ready to receive the seed of assumption and bring it into visible reality. Her presence at the cross and her recognition of the risen Jesus symbolise the receptive mind’s complete harmony with the conscious act of resurrection — the birth of a new state.</p><h3>Conclusion: The Journey from Resistance to Reflection</h3><p>Miriam’s story teaches us that every “woman” — every condition in our world — is born of our inner states. When our outer experience resists, it is not an enemy to be fought but an aspect of ourselves to be reclaimed and renamed. By consciously correcting and loving these conditions, we restore them to their rightful place as perfect reflections of our inner creative power.</p><p>In Genesis 2:23, to say, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,” is to recognise every experience as one’s own emanation. The evolution from Miriam to Mary Magdalene illustrates the journey from divided reflection to perfect union: the movement from rebellion to the joyous cooperation that gives life to new realities.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
