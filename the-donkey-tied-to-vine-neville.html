    <h1>The Donkey Tied to the Vine: Judah’s Blessing and Biblical Vine Imagery</h1>
    <p>In the blessing <a href="label-judah-s-blessing-series.html">Jacob gives to Judah</a> (Genesis 49:11–12), he declares:</p><p></p><blockquote><b>"Binding his foal to the vine, and his donkey’s colt to the choice vine; he washes his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes. His eyes will be dark with wine, and his teeth white with milk."</b></blockquote><p></p><p>This striking passage is not just poetic; it speaks directly to the creative process as understood in Neville Goddard’s teachings. Every image here — the vine, the donkey, the wine, and even the milk — symbolises a function of the imagination and the law by which it brings forth reality. <a href="label-judah-s-blessing-series.html">Jacob’s words to Judah</a> offer a vivid metaphor for the Law of Assumption and the inner alignment it requires.</p><hr/><h3>The Vine: Your “I AM” — The Creative Centre of Being</h3><p>In Scripture, the <strong>vine</strong> symbolises the inner source from which all life and experience grow. When <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> says, <em>“I am the vine, you are the branches”</em> (John 15:5), He is not referring to Himself as a separate being — He is revealing a mystical truth: the <strong>“<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” within you is the vine</strong>.</p><p>According to Neville Goddard, <strong>“I AM” is the name of God</strong> — not a phrase to be spoken lightly, but the <strong>awareness of being itself</strong>. It is the root of all creation, because whatever you attach to “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” — whether lack or abundance, sickness or wholeness — becomes the vine from which your world grows.</p><p>The <strong>vine</strong>, then, is your <strong>conscious assumption of being</strong> — your inner claim, “I AM this.” And the <strong>branches</strong> are the expressions of that claim, the conditions and events that unfold in your outer life.</p><p>So when Jacob blesses Judah and speaks of <strong>binding the donkey’s colt to the choice vine</strong>, he is illustrating this inner alignment: the <strong>natural mind (the donkey)</strong> is to be bound to the <strong>“I AM” — the chosen state of imagination</strong>. Instead of wandering in confusion, the mind is directed, stabilised, and nourished by the assumption of the fulfilled desire.</p><hr/><h3>The Donkey: The Subconscious in Obedience to Imagination</h3><p>In biblical symbolism, the <strong>donkey</strong> represents the natural mind — the subconscious, as Neville described it: the part of you that does not choose but simply accepts and brings forth what it has been impressed with in feeling. It moves automatically according to the dominant assumptions you hold.</p><p>To bind the donkey to the vine is to bring this subconscious force under the control of the imagined state. You no longer allow the mind to roam in old beliefs, fears, or habitual reactions. Instead, you discipline it — not through force, but through feeling — by anchoring it to the assumption of the wish fulfilled.</p><p>This same theme is echoed when <strong>Jesus enters Jerusalem riding on a donkey</strong> (Matthew 21:1–11). The donkey is not leading — it is carrying the assumed identity. It represents the subconscious mind in full submission to the divine self-awareness of “I AM.” The procession is peaceful but powerful, for it marks the fulfilment of imagination taking form.</p><hr/><h3>The Grapes and the Wine: Transformation Through Feeling</h3><p><strong>Grapes</strong> and <strong>wine</strong> are rich in symbolic meaning throughout Scripture. In the <a href="label-eden-series.html">Garden of Eden</a> (Eden means 'pleasure') and the <a href="label-song-of-solomon-series.html">Song of Solomon</a>, they are associated with pleasure, intimacy, and the inner garden of creative life. But in this context, <strong>wine</strong> becomes a sign of transformation — the result of crushing and fermenting the fruit into something deeper, richer, more potent.</p><p>For Neville, <strong>wine represents the feeling of fulfilment</strong> — the emotional state that corresponds to the reality you desire. To <strong>wash garments in wine</strong> is to immerse your outer life — your visible self, your identity — in the feeling of your imagined state as already real.</p><p>You don’t wait for change; you clothe yourself in it now. You saturate your being in the feeling that your desire is already fulfilled, and by this, the garment (your world) is dyed accordingly.</p><p>This image finds a companion in <strong>Song of Solomon 5:1</strong>, where the beloved says, <em>"I have drunk my wine with my milk."</em> The wine and milk — side by side — represent both the emotional depth and the sustaining nourishment of the assumed state. Wine is the joy of fulfilment; milk is the pure, sustaining substance that supports new life. Together, they speak to the richness and completeness of inner transformation.</p><hr/><h3>Living the Assumption: Binding the Mind to the Desired State</h3><p><a href="/search/label/Jacobs%20Blessing">Jacob’s blessing</a> of <a href="label-judah-series.html">Judah</a> is not merely a prophecy; it is a pattern for creative mastery. Every person is called to do the same: <strong>bind the natural mind to the choice vine</strong> — to yoke the subconscious to a definite state of being chosen in imagination.</p><p>You do this by <strong>assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>, which Neville called the only creative act. Once the assumption is made in feeling — not by force, but by inner conviction — the subconscious begins its work. Like the faithful donkey, it carries out what has been impressed upon it.</p><p>This is how you move from the old self to the new. This is how imagination becomes flesh.</p><hr/><h3>Judah Means Praise: The Spirit of Assumption</h3><p>The name <strong>Judah</strong> means <em><a href="the-lion-rules-domination-and-dominion.html">praise</a></em> — and that, too, is central to the Law of Assumption. Assumption is not a cold or mechanical act. It is inward worship — a joyful claiming of what is already yours in consciousness. You are not asking for it; you are praising it as done.</p><p>To bind the donkey to the vine is to bring the mind into <a href="the-lion-rules-domination-and-dominion.html">praise</a> of the assumed reality. To wash your garments in wine is to celebrate the transformation that has already taken place within. And to enter, like Jesus, into the city of manifestation riding on the back of that assumption — this is the true procession of faith.</p><hr/><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Jacob’s blessing to Judah is not a riddle of ancient poetry; it is a coded revelation of the creative process that governs your world. Imagination, the vine, is the life within you. The donkey, your subconscious mind, is to be yoked to it through assumption. The wine is the joy of fulfilment, and the garment is your lived identity. The milk is the steady nourishment that upholds the new state.</p><p>
</p><p>To live by the Law of Assumption is to praise, to bind, to feel — and therefore, to create.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-jacob-s-twelve-son-s-and-tribes-series.html">Jacob's Twelve Son's and Tribes Series</a> | <a href="label-judah-series.html">Judah Series</a> | <a href="label-judah-s-blessing-series.html">Judah's Blessing Series</a> | <a href="label-song-of-solomon-series.html">Song of Solomon Series</a></p>
