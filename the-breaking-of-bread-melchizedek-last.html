<h1>Melchizedek: Breaking Bread</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In both the Old and New Testaments, the act of breaking bread carries profound symbolism, particularly in relation to the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">awakening of imagination</a>—a key concept in Neville Goddard’s teachings. In this post, we will explore how Melchizedek’s appearance in Genesis 14 parallels the Last Supper of Jesus, each representing a breakthrough moment of awakened imagination, and how these two events symbolise the <a href="the-law-timeline.html">unfolding of awareness.</a></p>
<h3>Melchizedek: The First Breakthrough of Awakened Imagination</h3><div></div><blockquote><div>And Melchizedek king of Salem hath brought out bread and wine, and he is priest of God Most High;</div><div>And blessing him, said, May the blessing of the Most High God, maker of heaven and earth, be on Abram:</div></blockquote><div></div>
<p>In Genesis 14, we encounter Melchizedek, the priest of the Most High God, who appears to Abraham after his victory in battle. He brings out bread and wine, blessing Abraham and acknowledging his triumph. To the modern reader, this moment may seem like an ancient ritual, but Neville Goddard’s interpretation reveals a deeper meaning.</p>
<p>For Neville, Melchizedek represents the awakened imagination. His act of offering bread and wine signifies a spiritual nourishment that comes from the realization of the divine creative power within. Bread and wine are not mere physical sustenance in this context, but symbols of the imaginative power that sustains the mind and soul. The offering represents the first taste of a new reality—the awareness that imagination is the true force behind creation.</p>
<p>This encounter marks the initial awakening to the idea that imagination is not just a mental tool but a divine, creative force that aligns the individual with higher consciousness. Melchizedek’s blessing of Abraham, therefore, can be seen as the first step in awakening to the reality of one’s own imaginative power.</p>
<h3>The Last Supper: The Full Realization of Awakened Imagination</h3>
<p>The significance of the Last Supper with Jesus and his disciples in the Gospels takes this theme to its full realisation. When Jesus breaks the bread and shares wine, he symbolises the ultimate integration of the creative power of imagination. This act is not only a final teaching but a revelation that imagination is the key to the divine nature within us.</p>
<p>In Neville’s interpretation, the Last Supper represents the completion of the journey that begins with the recognition of imagination as a creative force. Whereas Melchizedek’s offering of bread and wine marks the initiation into the understanding of imagination’s power, the Last Supper is the moment when the individual fully embraces this power and recognises that it is through imagination—through conscious belief and inner vision—that desires are manifested.</p>
<p>Breaking the bread at the Last Supper is, therefore, a profound symbolic act of aligning with the divine creative essence. Just as the bread nourishes the body, imagination nourishes the spirit, transforming one’s consciousness and enabling the manifestation of what was once only imagined.</p>
<h3>Bread and Wine: The Nourishment of Imagination</h3>
<p>Both Melchizedek and Jesus present bread and wine—symbols that go beyond physical nourishment. For Neville Goddard, bread represents the sustenance that imagination provides to the mind, while wine signifies the heightened awareness that comes when we truly grasp the power of imagination.</p>
<p>In the case of Melchizedek, the bread and wine signify the first steps toward recognizing imagination’s power. It’s an awakening to the realization that our internal creative state can shape external reality. By the time of the Last Supper, this recognition has fully matured into the understanding that the imagination is, in fact, the creative power of God within us—an inherent divine tool we must consciously align with to manifest our desires.</p>
<h3>The Priesthood of Melchizedek and the Mastery of Imagination</h3>
<p>Melchizedek, as the priest of the Most High God, also represents spiritual authority. In Neville’s teachings, this can be understood as the recognition of one’s own authority over the creative process. To step into the "priesthood" of imagination is to become the conscious master of one’s thoughts and beliefs, aligning them with the desired outcomes. Melchizedek’s blessing of Abraham is symbolic of this inner authority being awakened—the first step toward understanding that we are the creators of our own reality.</p>
<p>Likewise, Jesus embodies this mastery at the Last Supper. As he breaks bread, he acknowledges that it is through him—through the understanding of divine imagination—that all things are created. He models the process of aligning with the divine will, manifesting the ideal state through belief and inner vision.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Two Pivotal Moments in the Awakening of Imagination</h3>
<p>The appearance of Melchizedek in Genesis 14 and the Last Supper with Jesus represent two critical milestones in the awakening of human consciousness to its creative power. While Melchizedek’s offering of bread and wine marks the initial breakthrough—a recognition of the divine nature of imagination—the Last Supper symbolises the full realization of this power and the conscious mastery over it. Both events teach us that through imagination, we align ourselves with divine creative potential and manifest our desires.</p>
<p>The story of Melchizedek and the Last Supper reminds us that the power to create lies within us. Just as Melchizedek blessed Abraham, and Jesus broke bread with his disciples, we, too, must "break" the boundaries of limiting beliefs and awaken to the truth that our imagination is the key to transforming our lives.</p>
