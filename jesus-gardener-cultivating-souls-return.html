<h1>Jesus: The 'Man' in the Garden </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The name “<a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Jesus</a>” means “<a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> is <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">salvation</a>,” but this salvation is not about external rescue, it is the awakening of a new state of awareness that actively goes around gathering every <a href="legion-according-to-neville-goddard.html">fractured part of the mind in need of healing</a>. Like a compassionate saviour, this consciousness restores what was lost in the original <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-eden-series.html">Garden of Eden</a>, returning each part to the <a href="dreams-visions-and-prophecy-as.html">vision</a> of pleasure, unity, and wholeness. Jesus is the living presence that walks through the inner landscape of our thoughts, feelings, and memories—transforming shame into acceptance, division into union, and fear into delight. He becomes the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man placed in the Garden of Eden</a> again.</p>
<h2>The Original Garden and the Birth of Separation</h2>
<p>In Genesis, Adam and Eve eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Their eyes are opened; shame enters. They cover themselves with fig leaves — coping stories born from division:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.”<br>
— Genesis 3:7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This moment marks the split between self and Source, the birth of duality.</p>
<h2>Jesus Brings the Garden’s Vision Back</h2>
<p>When Jesus heals the blind man at Bethsaida, the man first sees men “as <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-tree-of-life-series.html">trees</a>, walking”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.”<br>
— Mark 8:24</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This echoes Eden’s two <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-tree-of-life-series.html">trees</a> — <a href="the-garden-within-trees-rivers-and-flow.html">the tree of life and the tree of knowledge</a>. Jesus restores the vision of the tree of life: wholeness, rootedness, and union beyond judgment.</p>
<h2>From Eve’s Taste to the Shulamite’s Delight</h2>
<p>Eve’s taste of the fruit brought division. In contrast, the Shulamite woman in the <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-song-of-solomon-series.html">Song of Solomon</a> expresses the healed imagination delighting in union:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.”<br>
— Song of Solomon 2:3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the imagination resting securely in the beloved — the restored inner garden of joy, no longer shamed but celebrated.</p>
<h2>Jesus’s Ministry: Echoes of Eden’s Healing</h2>
<p>Throughout his ministry, Jesus reawakens Eden’s state of being, calling us back into the garden within:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When Jesus offers “<a href="the-woman-at-well-and-song-of-solomon.html">living water</a>” to the woman at the well, he invites her into a wellspring of eternal renewal:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst; but the water that I shall give him will become in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”<br>
— John 4:14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="the-woman-at-well-and-song-of-solomon.html">living water</a> recalls the river flowing from Eden, symbolising restored life within.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jesus calls himself the <a href="rooted-in-imagination-trees-vines-and.html">true vine</a>, and God the gardener:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.”<br>
— John 15:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This imagery affirms our union with the source of life, tended lovingly like a garden.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The parable of the mustard seed points to the kingdom’s growth from a tiny seed to a flourishing tree, reflecting Eden’s flourishing life and Song of Solomon’s imagery of shelter and delight:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants...”<br>
— Matthew 13:32</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jesus’ compassion at Lazarus’ tomb:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Jesus wept.”<br>
— John 11:35</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His grief and restoration of life echo the desire to heal the brokenness from Eden’s fall, breathing life into the dead places within.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The invitation to rest:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”<br>
— Matthew 11:28</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Jesus offers a return to the effortless peace of <a href="the-garden-and-temple-understanding.html">Eden’s garden</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the Last Supper, Jesus offers himself as the true fruit to be eaten:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Take, eat: this is my body.”<br>
— Matthew 26:26</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This act reverses the “forbidden fruit,” inviting us into wholeness and union rather than separation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mary Magdalene’s encounter with the risen Jesus in the garden:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? who are you looking for? She, taking him for the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have taken him away from here, say where you have put him and I will take him away.”<br>
— John 20:15</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her calling Jesus “gardener” symbolises his role as the restorer of the <a href="the-garden-and-temple-understanding.html">inner garden</a> of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>, gently tending and bringing new life.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: The Garden Restored in Awareness</h2>
<p>Jesus is the living consciousness of healing, walking through every shadow and wounded story within. He calls us to lay down our fig leaves, to open our eyes again, and to walk freely in the garden of our true being.</p>
<p>Where Eve’s choice marked division, Jesus’s presence marks reunion — not in some distant afterlife, but here and now, in the restored garden within.</p>
<p>The fruit is still sweet. The garden was never lost. Only the eyes of love had to be restored.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
