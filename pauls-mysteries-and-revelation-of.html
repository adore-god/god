<h1>Paul’s Secret Mystery: Christ in You</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Throughout his letters, the Apostle Paul speaks of a <b><i>secret</i></b>—something once veiled in symbolic language, now disclosed to those who can see inwardly. For many, these secrets or mysteries are theological or doctrinal. But to Neville Goddard, they are intensely practical. They are not locked in the heavens—they are hidden within you, waiting to be awakened as your own human imagination.</p><p>In this post, we explore every instance where Paul uses the word “<b><i>secret</i></b>,” not through the eyes of tradition, but through the vision Neville Goddard offers: that the <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">secret is Christ in you</a>—your imagination, your creative power, your salvation. Paul and Neville both emphasize that Christ is not an external God, distant and unreachable, but an <a href="elohim-god.html">internal presence within each person</a>. It is the potential embedded in every human being, ready to be awakened through imagination and inner transformation.</p><p><strong>Romans: The Mystery of Reversal and Revelation</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>Romans 11:25<br>
“For I would not, <a href="twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">brothers</a>, have you be ignorant of this <i>secret</i>, that there has been a part of <a href="israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel</a> made blind until the full number of the nations comes in.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Israel is a symbol of the mind gathered together under the law of Assumption, and the Gentiles as ungathered parts of the mind. The “fulness” of the Gentiles entering in is the awakening of imagination, as those once “outside” begin to direct their creative power.</p><blockquote>
<p>Romans 16:25<br>
“Now to the one who can strengthen you by means of the power working in us, through the giving of the <i>secret</i> kept safe through the sending of the true message about <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a>.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville reminds us that the mystery is not new—it is eternal. But it is secret only because man has forgotten how to look inward. The revelation comes not by study but by direct experience: when <a href="genesis-224-love.html">imagination and faith are wedded</a> in stillness.</p><p><strong>1 Corinthians: The Hidden Wisdom of the Creative Power</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 2:7<br>
“We are telling the wisdom of <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">God</a> in a <i>secret</i>, the hidden wisdom which <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">God</a> prepared before the world for our glory.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville equates this “hidden wisdom” with imagination. It is not the cleverness of man but the spiritual law that what you assume to be true—persistently and inwardly—must eventually harden into fact.</p><blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 4:1<br>
“Let a man think of us as the servants of <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a>, and the men in charge of the <i>secrets</i> of <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">God</a>.”</p>
</blockquote><p>To be a steward of the mysteries is to understand the law of assumption. One who has mastered their inner speech, inner vision, and feeling of the wish fulfilled, is a true minister of Christ—not outwardly, but inwardly, where creation begins.</p><blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 13:2<br>
“If I have the gift of speaking with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am no more than a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville interprets charity as love—specifically, <a href="genesis-224-love.html">love for the state you dwell in.</a> You must feel from the state of the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">wish fulfilled</a>. The type of feeling that's expressed in the Song of Solomon. Knowledge alone does not create; feeling does.</p><blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 14:2<br>
“<a href="interpreting-power-of-tongues-in-bible.html">The man who speaks in a tongue</a> is not speaking to men but to God, because no man understands him; he speaks in the Spirit and speaks <i>secrets</i>.”</p>
</blockquote><p><a href="interpreting-power-of-tongues-in-bible.html">Speaking in tongues</a>, for Neville, is symbolic of inner dialogue—those silent conversations with self that shape external life. These inner murmurs go unnoticed by the world, but they create the world nonetheless.</p><blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:51<br>
“Here is a <i>secret</i> for you: We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This is Neville’s central message: transformation. Not all will remain in the sleep of the senses. Some will awaken to the creative power within—and they shall be changed, for their world will conform to their awakened state.</p><p><strong>Ephesians: The Mystery of Union and Inclusion</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 1:9<br>
“He made known to us the <i>secret</i> of his will, according to his good pleasure which he had set forth in him.”</p>
</blockquote><p>His will is your will. God’s will is your desire—when imagined from its fulfilment. The mystery is that <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> and <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> are not separate. Imagination and the creator are one.</p><blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 3:3-4<br>
“By what revelation he made known to me the <i>secret</i>, as I have written before in a few words; by which you may read and understand my knowledge in the secret of Christ.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville often said <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a> in you is your own wonderful human imagination. Paul is saying: This is not belief. It is revelation. And once it happens, you no longer wonder—you know.</p><blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 3:9<br>
“To make all men see what is the fellowship of the <i>secret</i> of the grace of God which is given to you in Christ Jesus.”</p>
</blockquote><p>The “fellowship” is inner unity—when thought, feeling, and assumption align. When your inner world becomes whole, the outer must reflect it.</p><blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 5:32<br>
“This is a great <i>secret</i>: but I am speaking about Christ and the Church.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville reads this as the union of your awareness (Christ) with your desired state (church). <a href="genesis-224-love.html">Marriage, in scripture, is always symbolic. To be joined to the desired state is to experience it as real</a>.</p><blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 6:19<br>
“That for me the words may be given when I open my mouth with boldness to tell the <i>secret</i> of the good news.”</p>
</blockquote><p>The gospel, for Neville, is not a story of the past. It is the pattern of awakening: assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, persist in that assumption, and you will resurrect your desire.</p><p><strong>Colossians: The Mystery Made Manifest</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>Colossians 1:26-27<br>
“Which was kept <i>secret</i> for the times long past, but now is shown to his saints, to whom God has chosen to show the riches of the glory of this <i>secret</i> among the nations; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This is Neville’s cornerstone. Christ in you is not poetry—it is literal. It is your imagination. Glory is the fulfilment of what you imagined. You are not becoming like God—you already are.</p><blockquote>
<p>Colossians 2:2<br>
“That their hearts may be comforted and joined in love, and to all the riches of the full understanding of the <i>secret</i> of God, even of Christ.”</p>
</blockquote><p>To acknowledge is to accept. The mystery becomes real when you stop doubting and accept imagination as the source of reality.</p><blockquote>
<p>Colossians 4:3<br>
“With prayer for us, that God may open a door for us for the word, to show the <i>secret</i> of Christ.”</p>
</blockquote><p>That door is always inward. Prayer is not begging—it is assuming. Every act of imagining boldly and lovingly is a prayer that speaks Christ.</p><p><strong>2 Thessalonians &amp; 1 Timothy: The Dual Mysteries</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>2 Thessalonians 2:7<br>
“For the <i>secret</i> of <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">sin</a> is working in secret, only until he who lets it is taken away.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville saw “iniquity” as misuse of the law. When you dwell in fear, worry, or hatred, the same divine law still works—it simply brings forth what you did not want. This is why awareness must be disciplined.</p><blockquote>
<p>1 Timothy 3:9<br>
“Holding the <i>secret</i> of the faith in a clean heart.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Faith is loyalty to the unseen reality. A pure conscience is one that does not doubt the imaginal act. The mystery is that faith creates facts.</p><blockquote>
<p>1 Timothy 3:16<br>
“Great is the <i>secret</i> of the godly life: God was shown in the flesh.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the central truth of Neville’s gospel: God became man so that man may know himself as God. Every man who awakens to imagination as the source of his world is the Word made flesh.</p><p><strong>The Final Word: The Mystery Has Never Been Missing—Only Misunderstood</strong></p><p>Paul said the mystery was kept hidden for ages. Neville tells us it was hidden in plain sight—in the words, stories, and symbols of scripture. But it was never outside you. It was never locked away in time. It was always waiting to be realised as your own creative nature.</p><p>The mystery is not a riddle. It is a reminder:</p><blockquote>
<p>2 Corinthians 13:5<br>
“Do you not know yourselves? Have you not tried to see that Jesus Christ is in you?”</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville answers: yes—and He is your own wonderful human imagination.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-christ-in-you-series.html" class="noTag">Christ In You Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-elohim--god-series.html" class="noTag">Elohim: God Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-paul-series.html" class="noTag">Paul Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-paul-s-mystery-series.html" class="noTag">Paul's Mystery Series</a></p>
