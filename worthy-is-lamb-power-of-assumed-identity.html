<h1>Worthy Is the Slain Lamb: The New Assumption </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p></p><blockquote>“<b>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing</b>.”— Revelation 5:12</blockquote><p></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Offering of Abel: The First Inner Sacrifice</h2>
<p>Early in the Bible, a important moment occurs in <strong>Genesis 4:4–7</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Abel offered the best of his flock, and God was pleased with his gift because it aligned with genuine pleasure and true intent. Cain also brought an offering, but it did not please God, causing Cain to become angry and discouraged. God spoke to Cain, asking why he was upset and reminding him that if he did what was right, he would be accepted. But if he did not, sin was waiting to overcome him—yet Cain had the power to master it..”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abel’s offering of a <strong>lamb</strong>, the “firstlings of his flock,” represents the <strong>purest, most cherished part of oneself</strong>—the wholehearted surrender to a new state of being. God was pleased with Abel’s offering because it <strong>aligned with true pleasure</strong>—the joy and satisfaction found in sincere, loving commitment to transformation.</p>
<p>This acceptance signals that the true sacrifice is an <strong>undivided, living devotion</strong> to the inner vision, an offering made from a place of joy and alignment.</p>
<p>By contrast, Cain’s rejected offering represents the attempt to hold onto the old self without genuine alignment or pleasure in the new.</p>
<p>This story is the <strong>archetype of inner sacrifice</strong>—the act of giving up lesser assumptions and old identities to embrace the imagined new self fully and joyfully.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Slain Lamb: Your Imagined Self</h2>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the “Lamb” symbolises the <strong>assumed identity</strong>—the new <a href="genesis-126-man.html">inner image</a> you dare to accept as true.</p>
<p>To assume a new state of consciousness is to <strong>slay the old self</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To no longer respond from lack or limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To no longer identify with defeat or old patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To place your awareness in a new mould and let the old fall away.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This process echoes the biblical call to “die daily” (Paul) — <strong>continuously sacrificing every unworthy self-concept</strong> to the truth of your fulfilled desire.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Is the Lamb Worthy?</h2>
<p>The slain lamb is worthy because it embodies the courageous <strong>death of the old identity</strong>. Once mocked or ignored, this slain self is now crowned with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Power:</strong> The authority to imagine and remain faithful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Riches:</strong> The wealth of inner conviction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wisdom:</strong> Insight gained from walking in the assumed end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> The ability to hold fast despite outer contradiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Honour:</strong> Reverence developed for your own imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Glory:</strong> The radiance of alignment with your true self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blessing:</strong> The outpouring of fulfilled desire from within.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not external prizes, but <strong>inner faculties awakened through persistence</strong> in your new assumption.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Heavenly Choir: Inner Agreement in Action</h2>
<p>Revelation describes “many angels... saying with a loud voice.” This cosmic chorus is a metaphor for your <strong>inner faculties erupting in joyful agreement</strong>. When you fully embody the feeling of the wish fulfilled, every part of your subconscious sings:</p>
<p><strong>“Worthy is the Lamb.”</strong></p>
<p>This is not praise directed outward but an <strong>internal acknowledgment</strong> of your creative act.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Inner Sacrifice Is Always Worthy</h2>
<p>Neville taught that <strong>imagination creates reality</strong> but requires a <strong>full offering of self</strong>. You cannot live richly in a new identity while clinging to the shell of the old. Something must truly die.</p>
<p>That “something” is the <strong>Lamb</strong>—the old self—offered up so the new self can rise.</p>
<p>Remember Genesis 4:4–7: Abel’s lamb is the timeless emblem of this full and living sacrifice—the <strong>unwavering commitment to becoming your desired state, made with joy and alignment</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Final Reflection</h2>
<p>The declaration “Worthy is the Lamb” is not a distant cry to the heavens, but the <strong>soul’s recognition</strong> that the imagined self, once doubted or denied, now reigns within.</p>
<p>In your quiet acts of assumption—your choice to persist unseen—you have slain the old and brought forth the new. That is a victory worthy of all honour.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-genesis-4-7-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 4:7 Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-praise-series.html" class="noTag">Praise Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-revelation-series.html" class="noTag">Revelation Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-shepherd-and-lamb-series.html" class="noTag">Shepherd and Lamb Series</a></p>
