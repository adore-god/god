<h1>Marriage Symbolism: Husband, Wife, and Divorce</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In the mystical teachings of Neville Goddard, the biblical themes of <strong>marriage</strong>, <strong>husband</strong>, <strong>wife</strong>, and <strong>divorce</strong> are not records of outer human relationships, but symbols of inner psychological states. They reveal the laws by which imagination—man’s true creative power—operates.</p><p>Goddard taught that <strong>Scripture is not secular history</strong>, but a psychological allegory. Every passage describes inner processes: the relationship between the conscious and subconscious mind, and the assumptions that give birth to our reality.</p><hr><h3>Genesis 2:24 – The Mystery of Inner Union</h3><p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall become one flesh."</em> – Genesis 2:24</blockquote><p></p><p>This verse is the first to define the symbolism of <a href="scrolls/label-marriage-series.html" class="noTag">marriage</a>—a <a href="genesis-224-love.html">foundational theme</a> upon which the entire biblical narrative rests. When read through the symbolic framework of Neville’s teachings, it has nothing to do with biological families or legal unions. Instead, it reveals a profound psychological movement: the creative union of imagination and feeling.</p><p>To "<a href="genesis-224-love.html">leave father and mother</a>" means to detach from inherited beliefs, traditions, and assumptions—the mental lineage that shaped your former self. To “cleave to your wife” is to consciously unite with a new inner state: your <strong>desired assumption</strong>. When you fully accept this union in feeling, the two become “one flesh” in consciousness—and the outer world begins to reflect it.</p><hr><h3>Marriage: Consciousness Uniting with Assumption</h3><p>In Neville’s metaphysical view, <strong><a href="scrolls/label-marriage-series.html" class="noTag">marriage</a></strong> is the sacred union between the <strong>conscious mind</strong> (man) and the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> (woman). The conscious selects the idea; the subconscious receives it, nourishes it, and brings it forth as experience.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The conscious impresses the subconscious, while the subconscious expresses what is impressed.” – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>When you persist in assuming a new identity—wealthy, loved, free—it becomes your dominant inner state. The subconscious accepts it as truth and manifests it. This is the mystical “one flesh”: the idea and the feeling becoming indistinguishable.</p><hr><h3>The Samaritan Woman: Fragmented Inner Life</h3><p>Jesus said to the woman at the well:</p><blockquote>
<p>“You have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband.” – John 4:18</p>
</blockquote><p>To Neville, this woman symbolises the <a href="the-woman-at-well-and-song-of-solomon.html">bride</a> and the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>—divided, confused, married to conflicting assumptions over time: fear, scarcity, doubt, unworthiness, bitterness. These former “husbands” were once dominant emotional states.</p><p>The current man “not her husband” symbolises a fleeting hope—a wish she flirts with but hasn’t fully committed to. 'Man' is the self-formation in <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">consciousness</a>: the awareness that perceives, assumes, and expresses its own identity. Many people live in this space: dabbling in new beliefs without fully cleaving to them. Without true marriage—assumption accepted with feeling—no birth of change is possible.</p><hr><h3>Divorce: Withdrawing Power from the Old</h3><p>In this symbolic economy, <strong>divorce</strong> means mentally and emotionally detaching from an unwanted state. You no longer dwell on lack or sickness. You stop feeding it with attention and feeling.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Let not your heart be troubled...” – John 14:1</p>
</blockquote><p>But many remain inwardly married to pain. They revisit old disappointments, speak of problems as though they were fixed, and remain loyal to their unwanted state—thus renewing the same creation.</p><p>Divorce, in this context, is a courageous refusal to believe in what no longer serves you.</p><hr><h3>Faithfulness: Remaining in the New State</h3><p>To <strong>marry a new state</strong> is to remain loyal to it—even when outer facts suggest otherwise. If you desire abundance, you must feel abundant. If you seek love, you must live in the feeling of being loved.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Whatever you desire, <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">believe that you have received it,</a> and it will be yours.” – Mark 11:24</p>
</blockquote><p>Faithfulness is not effortful striving; it is inner certainty. You no longer argue with appearances. You live from the new identity, knowing that the subconscious will make it flesh.</p><hr><h3>Resurrection: The Re-marriage of the Ideal Self</h3><p>Once you “put off the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">old man</a>”—your former identity—you must <strong>remarry</strong> your ideal self. This is resurrection. You assume your new name, your new role, your new consciousness, and live from it faithfully.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Put off the old man… and put on the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">new man</a>, created in righteousness.” – Ephesians 4:22–24</p>
</blockquote><p>This new self is not achieved through works, but through <strong>assumption</strong>. You feel yourself to be already that which you desire to express—and persist in that inner knowing.</p><hr><h3>Summary: Genesis Fulfilled in You</h3><p>Genesis 2:24 is fulfilled each time you detach from limiting assumptions and unite with a new inner conviction. The “man” leaves all former ideas and cleaves to a new “wife”—a chosen emotional state—and the two become one reality.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Live as though your assumption is already a fact, and it will harden into reality.” – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>Imagination is the true husband. The subconscious is the obedient wife. Together, they shape the world you walk through. Leave behind the old. Marry your desire. Be faithful to it—and it will bear fruit in your life.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-24-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 2:24 Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-marriage-series.html" class="noTag">Marriage Series</a></p>
