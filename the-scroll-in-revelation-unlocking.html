<h1>The Scroll in Revelation: Your Inner Script</h1>
<div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In the Book of Revelation, the scroll is a symbol of our inner mental script—the assumptions, beliefs, and thoughts that shape what we experience. Think of your <strong><a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">head as a house</a></strong>. Inside, your memory is the school where everything is recorded. The doors to the house are gateways to your imagination and consciousness. How you open these <a href="the-door-shepherd-and-beloved-exploring.html">doors and change the assumptions inside</a> determines how your life unfolds.</p>
<h3>The Scroll as Your Inner Script</h3>
<p>Revelation describes the scroll as sealed and unreadable until the right one opens it:</p>
<blockquote>
“And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.”<br/>
— Revelation 5:1
</blockquote>
<p>This represents that our inner assumptions control what is “read” in our lives. Until we consciously assume new beliefs, the scroll remains sealed, and our desired outcomes remain unrealised.</p>
<h3>Assumption and the Law of Creation</h3>
<p>Neville Goddard teaches that imagination is the creative power. The scroll opens when we <strong>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>. This is how the sealed script in our mind starts expressing itself in reality. The “Lamb” in Revelation represents the awakened “I AM” consciousness—the inner self capable of taking authority over the mental script and manifesting what we assume as real.</p>
<h3>The Scroll and Authority</h3>
<p>In Revelation, only the “Lamb” is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals:</p>
<blockquote>
“And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”<br/>
— Revelation 5:5
</blockquote>
<p>This passage shows the awakening of your <strong>“I AM” consciousness</strong>, the part of your mind that can consciously take authority over your inner script—the assumptions stored in your mental house. The <strong>Lion of Judah</strong> represents control and praise, while the <strong>Root of David</strong> refers to possession of the “Beloved” state—your inner creative self. </p>
<p><a href="the-door-shepherd-and-beloved-exploring.html">David’s name contains two dalet letters</a>, which symbolize <strong>doors or gateways</strong>. These doors are entry points into your imagination and memory. By stepping through these doors—using assumption and feeling—you unlock the scroll and allow your desired reality to unfold. In Neville Goddard’s teaching, the Lamb is the mind that <strong>assumes and claims authority</strong> over its inner script.</p>
<h3>The Doors of the Head</h3>
<p><a href="the-door-shepherd-and-beloved-exploring.html">David’s name in Hebrew includes two dalet letters</a>, which symbolize doors. These doors are entry points into your imagination and memory. By consciously stepping through these doors—using assumption and feeling—you unlock the scroll. <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">Your head (the house) contains all your stored assumptions</a>, and the doors give you access to rewrite them from within.</p>
<h3>Aligning with the Inner “Lamb”</h3>
<p><a class="noTag" href="genesis-47-sin.html">Abel’s offering of the lamb in Genesis 4:4</a> shows that God (I AM that I AM) responds to inner alignment—assumption matched with feeling. Neville Goddard teaches living “as if” your desire is already fulfilled. When your assumption and feeling align, the scroll opens, and your inner script begins to manifest externally. Joyful, felt assumption is the key.</p>
<h3>Practical Steps to Open Your Scroll</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify Your Scroll:</strong> Notice the assumptions in your mind that shape your current experience.</li>
<li><strong>Rewrite through Assumption:</strong> Use imagination to revise your inner script, removing limiting beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Step Through the Doors:</strong> Consciously access your mind’s gateways to imagine and assume your fulfilled desire.</li>
<li><strong>Feel Fully:</strong> Engage deeply with the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Feeling is the key to unlocking the scroll.</li>
<li><strong>Claim Your Authority:</strong> Connect with your “I AM” awareness, your inner creative self, to manifest the reality you assume.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The scroll in Revelation is a metaphor for the assumptions and inner scripts in your mind. By understanding your head as a house, memory as a school, and doors as gateways to imagination, you can consciously rewrite your life story. Through assumption and feeling, you step into the role of creator, unlocking the scroll and manifesting a reality aligned with your true desires.</p>
