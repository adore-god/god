<h1>The Scroll in Revelations: The Word of God Recorded</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The scroll is a powerful and recurring symbol in the Book of Revelation, often associated with mystery, authority, and the unfolding of destiny. Beyond its literal or prophetic context, the scroll holds a deeper psychological meaning—it represents the mental script or “inner record” each person carries within: the assumptions, beliefs, and feelings that shape their reality. It is the record of the '<a href="creating-with-scripture-word-of-god-and.html">word of God</a>' which is metaphor again for <a href="elohim-god.html">internal conscious dialogue</a> - or mental voices and visions.</p>
<h3>The Scroll as a Metaphor for Consciousness</h3>
<p>In Revelation, the scroll is described as sealed and unreadable until the rightful one opens it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.”<br>
— Revelation 5:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This represents the inner mental script that governs our experience, yet remains hidden from conscious awareness until we awaken to its power. Our assumptions and beliefs act like seals on this scroll, controlling what manifests in our lives.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption teaches that imagination is the divine creative power that “writes” reality. Until we consciously “open the scroll” by assuming the feeling of the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">wish fulfilled</a>, our desires remain unseen and unrealised. The opening of the scroll is, therefore, an awakening to the power we hold to shape our world through inner conviction and feeling.</p>
<h3>The Scroll and Divine Authority</h3>
<p>In Revelation, only the “Lamb” is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.”<br>
— Revelation 5:5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “<a href="the-lion-rules-domination-and-dominion.html">Lion (control) of Judah (praise)</a>” and “Root of David" (<a href="jesse-i-possess-beloved-evolution-of.html">possession of the Beloved</a>) symbolise the awakened “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” consciousness within us—our true creative self. David’s name means “beloved” and contains two dalet letters, Hebrew symbols for <a href="unlocking-power-of-doors-neville.html">doors</a> or gateways. This connection reveals the “beloved I AM” as the <a href="unlocking-power-of-doors-neville.html">doorway</a> through which the scroll is opened—ushering in the new state of perception that brings manifestation.</p>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teaching, this is the mind that assumes and claims authority over the inner script, enabling the unfolding of the desired reality.</p>
<p>Here the symbolism of the Lamb also connects deeply with the offering of Abel’s lamb in Genesis 4:4, where God “had pleasure” in Abel’s gift. This <a href="the-four-rivers-of-eden-flowing-delight.html">pleasure</a> points to the inner alignment and <a href="feeling-is-secret-unlocking-bliss.html">joyful assumption of the wish fulfilled</a>—key to unlocking manifestation. Unlike Cain’s offering, which lacked this harmony, Abel’s lamb represents the felt state of fulfilled desire, the mental “<a href="the-four-rivers-of-eden-flowing-delight.html">pleasure</a>” that opens the scroll. The Lamb’s worthiness to open the scroll reminds us that manifestation flows from this state of joyful faith and inner harmony, just as Neville Goddard teaches<strong>.</strong></p>
<h3>The Law of Assumption: Opening Your Inner Scroll</h3>
<p>Our assumptions act like seals on the scroll of our life story. Until these seals are consciously broken—by deliberately assuming the <a href="feeling-is-secret-unlocking-bliss.html">feeling of our fulfilled desire</a>—the scroll remains closed, and manifestation is delayed or denied.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard encourages us to live “as if” our desires are already fulfilled, embodying that state fully and persistently. This process is the act of “opening the scroll” from within. By doing so, the blueprint encoded in your imagination is unlocked and begins to express itself in the outer reality.</p>
<h3>Practical Steps to Unlock Your Scroll</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify Your Scroll</strong>: Reflect on the subconscious assumptions and beliefs that shape your current experience. These are the sealed contents of your scroll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revision and Assumption</strong>: Use Neville’s techniques of revision and imagining the end state to rewrite the script, consciously removing limiting seals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feel the Fulfilment</strong>: Engage your emotions deeply—feeling is the key that opens the scroll. Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled as vividly as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Align with the Lamb</strong>: Connect with your “I AM” awareness, your true self, which holds the authority to manifest your desires.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The scroll in Revelation is more than an ancient prophetic object—it is a symbol of the mental and spiritual unlocking required for personal transformation. Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption provides the key to open this scroll, rewrite your life story from within, and manifest a reality aligned with your deepest desires.</p>
<p>By recognising that the scroll represents your inner assumptions, and by assuming the feeling of your fulfilled wish, you step into your role as the author and creator of your experience. The scroll unfolds only when you claim your power and embrace the creative authority of the “I AM” within—the beloved “Root of David” who opens the door to new realities.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
