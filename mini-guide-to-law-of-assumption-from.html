<p><strong>What is the Law of Assumption?</strong></p><p>
The Law of Assumption teaches that by assuming the feeling of your wish fulfilled, you align your consciousness with your desire, making it manifest in your life. This principle echoes many biblical teachings about the power of belief, faith, and the creative role of our imagination in shaping our reality.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Key Biblical Principles of the Law of Assumption:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Faith as the Foundation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."</em> – Hebrews 11:1<br/>
Faith in the unseen is at the heart of the Law of Assumption. You must believe in the reality of your desire before it manifests, trusting that your assumptions are becoming real.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask, Seek, Knock</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."</em> – Matthew 7:7<br/>
In this verse, Jesus speaks to the active process of manifestation: asking, seeking, and knocking represent assuming the outcome with certainty. This aligns perfectly with the Law of Assumption, where you assume the outcome of your prayers and desires.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>As a Man Thinketh, So Is He</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he."</em> – Proverbs 23:7<br/>
What you assume and imagine in your heart shapes your external reality. The Law of Assumption shows that the mind’s inner thoughts directly determine what you experience in the outer world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whatsoever You Desire, Believe You Have Received</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."</em> – Mark 11:24<br/>
This verse reinforces the Law of Assumption. When you believe your desire has already been fulfilled, it will manifest. The belief is the key to unlocking what you assume is already yours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Power of the Imagination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."</em> – Genesis 11:6<br/>
Imagination is a powerful tool in creation. This passage highlights that once a collective imagination is focused on a goal, it becomes unstoppable. The Law of Assumption works through focusing your imagination on the desired end result, assuming it is already real.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM: The Power of Your Identity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"I AM that I AM."</em> – Exodus 3:14<br/>
God’s statement, "I AM," reveals the power of self-identification. The Law of Assumption aligns with this by teaching that you must assume the identity of the person who already possesses what you desire. By saying "I AM" and assuming the state of having your wish fulfilled, you align your consciousness with the reality of your desires.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Made in God’s Image</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</em> – Genesis 1:27<br/>
The Bible teaches that we are created in God's image. This reflects the power of imagination and assumption in the Law of Assumption. Just as God created the world with His words and thoughts, we have the ability to create our reality by aligning our assumptions with divine imagination. By assuming the state of your desire, you are tapping into this creative power.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Practical Steps to Apply the Law of Assumption Biblically:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Define Your Desire with Clarity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be specific about what you want to manifest, as Abraham was given a clear promise of descendants. <em>"Call those things which be not as though they were."</em> – Romans 4:17</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assume the Feeling of the Wish Fulfilled</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Imagine and feel your desire already fulfilled. <em>"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."</em> – Genesis 1:3<br/>
Like God’s creative act, assume your desire is already real and speak it into being.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pray with Belief</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you ask for something, believe that you have already received it. <em>"Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."</em> – Mark 11:24</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Walk by Faith, Not by Sight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"For we walk by faith, not by sight."</em> – 2 Corinthians 5:7<br/>
Trust in the unseen. The Law of Assumption requires walking by faith and not being swayed by current circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persist in Assumption</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"Ask and it will be given; knock and the door will open."</em> – Matthew 7:7<br/>
Remain persistent in your assumption that your desire is already fulfilled. Your faith and assumption will bring it into being.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Conclusion: The Bible and the Law of Assumption</strong><br/>
The Law of Assumption <b>originates</b> <i>from</i> the <b>Bible</b>. The Bible emphasises faith, imagination, and the power of identity—concepts that are central to manifesting desires. By assuming the feeling of your wish fulfilled, and aligning your identity with the person who already has what they desire, you tap into the creative power that the Bible teaches.</p>
<p>The key to manifestation, both in Neville Goddard’s teachings and biblical wisdom, is to believe and assume your desires are already fulfilled. Just as God said, "I AM," and created the world, you too can create your reality by assuming the feeling of your desire as if it is already yours.</p>
