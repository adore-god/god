<h1>Woman: Barreness to Fruitfulness </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Neville Goddard&rsquo;s teachings on manifestation centre around the idea that the subconscious mind is the creative force behind all external circumstances. Through imagination, we can create reality &mdash; and what we believe to be true about ourselves shapes our experience. The Bible, rich in spiritual symbolism, supports this idea when interpreted as a psychological drama, particularly through the stories of <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">women</a>.</p><p>In this post, we explore how the barren <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">women</a> of the Old Testament represent early stages of subconscious development &mdash; yearning, disjointed, and incomplete &mdash; while the <a href="mem-hebrew-letter-meanint-water-and.html">Marys of the New Testament</a> symbolise a unified subconscious that is capable of divine conception. And at the centre of this evolution lies a clue in <strong>Genesis 2:23</strong>, the moment <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Adam beholds woman</a> and recognises her as his own emanation.</p><hr/><h3>Genesis 2:23 &mdash; The Emergence of Feminine Consciousness</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Genesis 2:23</p>
</blockquote><p>This verse is not just about the creation of Eve; it <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">symbolises the emergence of the <strong>subconscious</strong> from the <strong>conscious self</strong></a>. The "<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a>" is the reflected, formative aspect &mdash; drawn from the inner being of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> &mdash; not separate from him but an expression of him. In Neville&rsquo;s terms, this is the moment the conscious mind becomes aware of its own creative partner: imagination, intuition, and emotional conviction &mdash; all attributes of the subconscious mind.</p><p>To "<a href="genesis-224-love.html">cleave unto his wife</a>" (Genesis 2:24) is to unite consciously with this subconscious faculty, recognising its power to <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">bring forth</a> what the conscious mind impresses upon it. The story is not about gender, but about the two aspects of one being: <strong>the conscious selector and the subconscious fulfiller</strong>.</p><hr/><h3>The Barren Women of the Old Testament: The Struggle of the Subconscious Mind</h3><p>The repeated motif of barren <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">women</a> in the Old Testament &mdash; Sarah, Rachel, Leah, and Hannah &mdash; reflects the <strong>subconscious mind in its early stages</strong>: wanting to create, but not yet aligned with faith or <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">assumption</a>. They desire children, which represent <em>manifestations</em> &mdash; yet they remain fruitless until their faith deepens.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sarah</strong> symbolises delayed fulfilment. Her story reminds us that the subconscious can appear unproductive until the assumption is fully accepted.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said&hellip;&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Genesis 21:1</p>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong> represents frustration: the subconscious disconnected from belief. Her conception of Joseph marks the shift from delay to divine memory.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And God remembered Rachel&hellip;&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Genesis 30:22</p>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>, though unloved, still conceives &mdash; showing that <strong>neglected subconscious states</strong> can still manifest powerfully when engaged.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb&hellip;&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Genesis 29:31</p>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong> demonstrates persistence. Her fervent, focused desire is rewarded, showing that <strong>faith fuels the womb of imagination</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;If thou wilt&hellip; give unto thine handmaid a man child&hellip;&rdquo;</em> &mdash; 1 Samuel 1:11</p>
</blockquote><p>These women portray the subconscious as a fertile ground that <em>requires <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">belief</a></em>, <em><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">assumption</a></em>, and <em>inner alignment</em> to become fruitful.</p><hr/><h3>Mary: The Fertile Subconscious of the New Testament</h3><p>With Mary &mdash; the mother of Jesus &mdash; the Bible shows a turning point. She does not struggle to conceive. She does not cry out in barrenness. Her subconscious is <strong>ready</strong>, <strong>pure</strong>, and <strong>aligned</strong>. She symbolises the fully integrated, unified subconscious &mdash; the one that can receive divine seed (idea) and bring forth God.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Thou shalt conceive&hellip; and bring forth a son.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Luke 1:31</p>
</blockquote><p>Mary&rsquo;s <a href="virgin-and-harlot-symbolism-according.html">virginity</a> isn&rsquo;t biological &mdash; it is psychological. It means the <strong>subconscious is no longer reacting to outer facts</strong>, but is still, expectant, and receptive to the imagination. This is Neville&rsquo;s ideal: the subconscious made fertile through <strong><a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assumption</a></strong>&nbsp;not effort.</p><hr/><h3>Jesus as Manifested Consciousness: The Second Adam</h3><p>If Eve is taken from Adam (Genesis 2:23), symbolising the subconscious emerging from consciousness, then <strong><a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">Jesus is the full return of that union</a></strong> &mdash; the Word made flesh. He is the <strong>child born of the subconscious that has fully received the conscious assumption</strong>. This makes Jesus not only the Son of God but also the Son of Mary &mdash; the <strong>product of a <a href="the-bibles-golden-thread-union-with-new.html">perfectly joined</a> <a href="genesis-224-love.html">conscious-subconscious union</a></strong>.</p><hr/><h3>The Many Marys: Unified Functions of the Subconscious</h3><p>The <a href="why-are-there-so-many-marys-in-new.html">repetition of the name <strong>Mary</strong></a> in the <a href="mem-hebrew-letter-meanint-water-and.html">New Testament</a> is not a coincidence. Each one reflects a <em>function</em> of the unified subconscious:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary Magdalene</strong>: The <em>purified</em> subconscious, healed from past error and now devoted.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Out of whom he had cast seven devils&hellip;&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Mark 16:9</p>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary of Bethany</strong>: The <em>receptive</em> subconscious, sitting at the feet of wisdom.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;She&hellip; sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Luke 10:39</p>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary the Mother of James</strong>: The <em>enduring</em> subconscious &mdash; present even in suffering, holding memory and resurrection.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And Mary&hellip; and Salome.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Mark 15:40</p>
</blockquote><p>Each <a href="mem-hebrew-letter-meanint-water-and.html">Mary</a> shows a different mode of the subconscious: healed, still, faithful &mdash; and ready to bring forth not just desire, but divine <em>transformation</em>.</p><hr/><h3>Martha: The Active Subconscious in Motion</h3><p>By contrast, <strong>Martha</strong> reflects the busy, distracted subconscious &mdash; the one caught up in &ldquo;doing&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;being.&rdquo; Neville would say that Martha symbolises a mind trying to <em>force</em> manifestation instead of entering the state of the wish fulfilled.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Martha was cumbered about much serving&hellip;&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Luke 10:40</p>
</blockquote><p>Her energy is necessary, but <strong>not sovereign</strong>. The deeper truth is found in Mary&rsquo;s stillness &mdash; the state that receives and conceives.</p><hr/><h3>Conclusion: Genesis 2:23 Fulfilled in Mary</h3><p>Genesis 2:23 is not just the origin of woman; it is the first recognition of the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> &mdash; a being taken from you, shaped by you, and eventually made <strong>one with you</strong> (Genesis 2:24). The Marys of the New Testament represent the <strong>return to that union</strong>, no longer fragmented but harmonised &mdash; no longer barren, but fully fertile.</p><p>Mary, as the new Eve, embodies the <strong>subconscious made whole</strong>, capable of manifesting <strong>not just outer changes</strong>, but divine reality. Jesus, born from this union, symbolises the <strong>Word made flesh</strong> &mdash; the final fruit of conscious assumption fixed in fertile imagination.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Be it unto me according to thy word.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Luke 1:38</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the essence of Neville&rsquo;s teaching: the creative power of your own being, when united in love and assumption, will produce your world &mdash; just as union produced Jesus, the spiritual fulfilment of Genesis 2:23.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
