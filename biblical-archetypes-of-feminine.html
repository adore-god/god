<h1>Woman: Barreness to Fruitfulness </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>Neville Goddard’s teaching on manifestation centres on one core idea: reality flows from identity. What we assume ourselves to be shapes what appears in our world. The Bible supports this idea when read as a symbolic drama of the mind — especially through its recurring use of men and women.</p>

<p>In Scripture, <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> and <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a> are not separate beings in conflict. They are <a href="elohim-god.html"><strong>personified aspects of the same mind</a></strong>. “Man” represents the declaring awareness — the <em>I AM</em>. “Woman” represents the part of the mind that <strong>remembers, responds, and forms</strong> according to that declaration. What the <em>I AM</em> assumes, woman carries forward.</p>

<p>Seen this way, the repeated theme of barren women is not biological or moral — it describes a <strong>disconnection between assumption and imagination</strong>. Desire exists, but the inner agreement has not yet settled.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Genesis 2:23 — One Mind, Two Functions</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.”</em> — Genesis 2:23</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This verse is not describing separation but recognition. Woman is taken out of Man because she reflects him. She is the responding aspect of the same being.</p>

<p>Symbolically, this is the moment awareness realises that what it assumes does not remain abstract — it is echoed, remembered, and shaped into form. Woman is not lesser, passive, or external. She is the inner witness that agrees — or disagrees — with the <em>I AM</em>.</p>

<p>To “cleave” (Genesis 2:24) is to bring these two functions into harmony. When identity and response are aligned, creation follows naturally.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Barrenness — When Assumption and Imagination Are Not Yet United</h2>

<p>The Old Testament repeatedly presents women who long to conceive but cannot. This is not repetition for drama — it is instruction.</p>

<p>Barrenness symbolises a state where the <em>I AM</em> desires, but the responding mind has not yet fully agreed. There is effort, yearning, even faith — but not rest. Each barren woman shows a different stage of this inner process:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="sarahs-laughter-humour-of-manifestation.html"><strong>Sarah</strong> — the first stage of learning the law of assumption</a>. She laughs at the idea that joy and pleasure themselves could be creative. Her laughter is not mockery — it is surprise. Isaac (“laughter”) is born when joy itself is trusted.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said…”</em> — Genesis 21:1</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong> — frustration: desire exists but agreement is incomplete. Her breakthrough comes when the text says, “God remembered Rachel,” showing that alignment, not effort, opens the womb.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“And God remembered Rachel…”</em> — Genesis 30:22</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Leah</strong> — though unloved, she conceives, showing that even neglected inner states respond when identity is engaged.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb…”</em> — Genesis 29:31</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="el/hannah-favour-dedication.html"><strong>Hannah</strong> — devotion. She does not merely discover the law; she commits the whole mind to it</a>. Peace arrives before conception, showing that agreement has already been reached.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“If thou wilt… give unto thine handmaid a man child…”</em> — 1 Samuel 1:11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These women portray stages of the mind learning to unite assumption with imagination. Barrenness reflects inner division. Fruitfulness reflects agreement.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Mary — The Mind That Fully Agrees</h2>

<p><a href="the-virgin-birth-of-love.html">With <strong>Mary</strong>, the Bible shows a decisive shift</a>. There is no struggle, no delay, no bargaining. She hears the word and agrees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Thou shalt conceive… and bring forth a son.”</em> — Luke 1:31</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mary represents a mind that no longer argues with identity. Her so-called virginity symbolises freedom from contradiction — a mind not reacting to appearances, but responding only to the word accepted within.</p>

<p>Her reply says everything:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Be it unto me according to thy word.”</em> — Luke 1:38</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is imagination fully aligned with assumption.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jesus — The Union Made Visible</h2>

<p>If woman is taken out of man in Genesis, then Jesus represents the visible outcome of that union restored. He is the Word made flesh — assumption fixed, agreed with, and embodied. He is called the Son of God and the Son of Mary because he is born from identity and response perfectly joined.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Many Marys — Unified Functions of the Mind</h2>

<p>The repetition of the name <strong>Mary</strong> in the New Testament highlights different expressions of the same unified mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="the-transformative-relationship-between.html"><strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> — the mind healed from past error</a> and no longer divided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary of Bethany</strong> — the receptive mind, listening rather than striving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary the Mother of James</strong> — the enduring mind, faithful even in difficulty, holding memory and resurrection.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Each shows a state of inner agreement rather than fragmentation, demonstrating that the mind has become fully responsive and fertile.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Martha — Activity Without Alignment</h2>

<p><a href="the-master-is-here.html"><strong>Martha</strong> represents the mind busy with doing</a>, trying to assist creation rather than resting in being.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Martha was cumbered about much serving…”</em> — Luke 10:40</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her energy is not wrong — but it is not creative. Creation flows from agreement, not activity.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion — From Genesis to Fulfilment</h2>

<p><a class="noTag" href="genesis-223-woman.html">Genesis 2:23 introduces the twofold operation of the mind</a>. The rest of the Bible shows its education. <a href="biblical-archetypes-of-feminine.html">Barrenness reflects inner division</a>. Fruitfulness reflects agreement. Mary represents the mind that has stopped resisting itself.</p>

<p><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> symbolises what is born when assumption and imagination are fully united. This is the biblical teaching Neville pointed to: when the mind agrees with its own declaration of being, reality must follow.</p>
