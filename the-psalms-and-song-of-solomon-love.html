<h1>The Psalms and the Song of Solomon: Love Letters from the Wish Fulfilled</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not a historical record, but a psychological drama unfolding within each of us. In that light, the Psalms and the Song of Solomon take on an extraordinary depth—not merely poetry or worship, but divine communication between consciousness and its own fulfilment.</p>
<p><strong>David as the Wish Fulfilled</strong></p>
<p>In Neville’s teaching, David symbolises the <em>wish fulfilled</em>—the state of being that results when man unites his awareness with a desire assumed to be true. David is not someone outside you. He is the inner man who has <em>become</em> what he once longed for.</p>
<p>When you read the Psalms, you are not listening to the cry of a distant king—you are hearing the voice of your own fulfilled self. The Psalms are the song of David, yes, but that means they are the voice of <em>your realised state</em>, speaking to your present consciousness, urging you to trust, to persist, and to identify with the end rather than the means.</p>
<p>The familiar cry, <em>“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want,”</em> is not the voice of lack, but of fullness. It is the wish already lived into, calling you to remember: <em>I am already that.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Inner Romance of the Song of Solomon</strong></p>
<p>Where the Psalms are intimate conversations between the soul and its fulfilment, the Song of Solomon is a romantic celebration of that union. Neville saw this book as the soul’s mystical love affair with its own divine imagination—the moment desire and awareness are no longer two, but one.</p>
<p>The beloved in the Song is the state you long to embody. The lover is your own I AM, reaching out in adoration. The poetry is sensual, but the meaning is spiritual: when your awareness (man) cleaves to imagination (woman), a new state of being is conceived. That is the creative act behind all manifestation.</p>
<p><strong>Together: A Journey from Cry to Union</strong></p>
<p>Read together, the Psalms and the Song of Solomon guide us through the full arc of inner transformation—from the first cry of the heart, to the stabilising of faith, to the passionate union with the assumed reality. These are not just books—they are love letters, written from your future self to your present one, reminding you:</p>
<p><em>You are not chasing a promise. You are becoming it.</em></p><div class="share-dropdown">
