<h1>Ezekiel 28: The Fall of the Unawakened Imagination: Neville Goddard Interpretation</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p><em>Ezekiel 28</em> is often read as a historical judgment against the prince and king of Tyre, but when interpreted through the Law of Assumption, it becomes a powerful psychological teaching about misaligned self-concept and the misuse of imagination. This chapter outlines the fall of a figure who represents the person misusing their creative power—assuming from pride, separation, and ego rather than from unity with the "I AM."</p><p><strong>The Fearful Literal Reading</strong></p><p>Reading the Bible literally can often feel overwhelming—even frightening—as many passages appear to condemn or accuse the reader. The language is intense, and the narratives often centre around judgment, punishment, or destruction. But when understood symbolically and psychologically, the Bible transforms into a deeply personal guide. Passages that once seemed threatening begin to reveal the inner dynamics of our own consciousness. They show us the moments we drift from our creative power and forget who we truly are. Far from inciting fear, these stories mirror our internal struggles and gently call us back to spiritual clarity, creative authority, and divine self-remembrance. This passage presents an inner dialogue in which the self reflects on a loss of direction in the process of manifestation.</p><hr><p><strong>Verses 1–2: The Ego Claims, “I Am a God”</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"Because your heart is proud, and you have said, 'I am a god...,' yet you are but a man."</p>
</blockquote><p>This speaks to a self-concept inflated by material evidence but disconnected from awareness of the true “I AM.” The Law of Assumption teaches that what we assume to be true of ourselves becomes our reality. Here, the “prince of Tyre” represents a state of consciousness that tries to affirm godlike status without aligning with the inner feeling of oneness—leading to collapse.</p><hr><p><strong>Verses 3–5: Assumption Misused for Gain Alone</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth... but your heart has become proud."</p>
</blockquote><p>When imagination is used solely for outer gain—without inner awareness—it leads to imbalance. Neville taught that it’s not wrong to desire material success, but when those assumptions are made from pride or competition, the results are unstable. Lasting transformation comes from embodying the feeling of being what you wish to be in alignment with love and unity.</p><hr><p><strong>Verses 6–9: The Collapse of a False Identity</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"Because you make your heart like the heart of a god... you shall die the death of the uncircumcised."</p>
</blockquote><p>This represents the end of a false assumption—an identity that was never fully accepted in feeling or truth. The “death” is symbolic of the crumbling of a manifestation based on outer show rather than inner conviction. In Law of Assumption terms, when we assume from a surface level but do not feel it deeply within, the outer structure inevitably breaks down.</p><hr><p><strong>Verses 11–19: The Lament for the Fallen Assumer</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"You were in Eden... until iniquity was found in you."</p>
</blockquote><p>This is a symbolic memory of our original creative purity—before the misuse of assumption. The “king of Tyre” is now a more developed figure, closer to full awareness, yet still falls through separation and identification with form. Eden represents the state of harmony we experience when we assume rightly—from unity with the I AM.</p><hr><p><strong>Verse 13: The Wealth of Consciousness Before the Fall</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"Every precious stone was your covering..."</p>
</blockquote><p>The jewels represent divine faculties of imagination—vivid, multifaceted, and powerful. In the Law of Assumption, each assumption we make shapes the world around us like a gem refracting light. But when these faculties are used to build an image of personal glory rather than embodying truth, they become coverings—illusions rather than expressions.</p><hr><p><strong>Verse 17: Corruption of the Assumption</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"Your heart was proud because of your beauty..."</p>
</blockquote><p>This reflects how we can become enchanted by our manifestations—mistaking the image for the source. When we become attached to appearances and assume from vanity or separation, the assumption becomes unstable. Neville stressed that the state must be assumed <em>with feeling</em>, not from ego, but from identification with the desired state as <em>already true</em>.</p><hr><p><strong>Conclusion: Awakening the Conscious Creator</strong></p><p><em>Ezekiel 28</em> becomes a rich metaphor for the fall and rise of the assumptive self. It warns against assuming from pride, lack, or competition, and encourages us to return to inner conviction—“I AM”—as the only true creative power.</p><p>The fall isn’t a punishment, but a lesson: when we forget our power or assume from fear or arrogance, we disconnect from creative harmony. But even then, the Law of Assumption assures us we can realign instantly.</p><p>As Neville Goddard said:<br>
<strong>"Change your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live."</strong><br>
Assume wisely. Assume lovingly. And return to Eden—not as a place, but as a state.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
