<h1>Feeling Good Isn’t the Proof of the Doctrine—It’s the Proof of the Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><em>Many people come to the Bible through traditional Christianity and find deep comfort in the figure of Jesus. But here’s the thing—they’re not truly connecting to a physical man who lived 2,000 years ago. Whether they realise it or not, they’re connecting with what Jesus symbolises:</em> <strong>Imagination</strong>.</p>
<p>The teachings of Jesus feel good, not because they validate a historical timeline, but because they awaken something timeless within—the creative power of the self. That feeling of peace, of security, of being “seen”—it’s the result of assuming something deeply personal and alive. That assumption is, <em>“I am known. I am loved. I am safe.”</em> And when those assumptions take root, the corresponding feelings follow.</p>
<p>This is why Neville Goddard said, <em>“Feeling is the secret.”</em> It’s not about agreeing with doctrine or memorising stories. It’s about the emotional alignment with a state of being that uplifts, transforms, and restores. When someone walks away from a church service or a passage of Scripture feeling renewed, it’s not because the dogma is correct. It’s because they’ve temporarily stepped into a state of consciousness that feels like home.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Missing the Meaning, Clinging to the Form</strong></h2>
<p>But many stop there.</p>
<p>They cling to the outer image—the Sunday school stories, the moral framework, the sense of religious belonging—without ever asking what Jesus <em>means</em>. They miss that Jesus is the symbol of <strong>awakened imagination</strong>, the power to assume, to create, to resurrect life from within.</p>
<p>The Bible isn’t a history book—it’s a psychological drama. Every character, every event, every parable is a code for an inner experience. The story of Jesus is not about one man—it’s about the power within every man and woman to rise, to assume the highest, and to express the divine.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>The Real Proof</strong></h2>
<p>So yes, feeling good is a beautiful thing. But it’s not the proof that the literal message is true.</p>
<p>It’s the proof that you've made an assumption—and your body and emotions have followed. That’s the real secret: you're not being saved by a man outside of you, you're being stirred by the recognition of who you really are within.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Let the good feeling be a signpost, not a stopping point. Let it guide you beyond the surface, into the heart of the symbol—where imagination waits to reveal its infinite power.</em></p><div class="share-dropdown">
