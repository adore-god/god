<h1>David and Saul: The New Man Vs the Natural Man</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In the sacred theatre of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>, every person embodies both Saul and David. These <a href="genesis-126-man.html">men</a> continue a process first symbolised by <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">Cain and Abel</a>, where Cain’s act of killing Abel marks the beginning of an inner struggle that Saul and David carry forward. Far from being historical characters, Saul and David represent living symbols of the states you assume. Neville Goddard teaches that all things proceed from within, for the outer world is a <a href="the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">mirror reflecting your inner state</a>. To understand the dynamic between David and Saul is to understand the interplay between your <b>old assumption</b> and your <b>new assumption</b> — between the <b>old self</b> and the <b><a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">wish fulfilled self</a></b>.</p>
<h3>Saul: The Old Assumption, the Old Self</h3>
<p>Saul represents the “old self,” the man bound by his present circumstances, by limitations and habitual thoughts. He is the embodiment of your <strong>old assumption</strong>, the state of consciousness rooted in “what is” — the present reality you have accepted as true.</p>
<p>Neville teaches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The world is a mirror, forever reflecting what you assume within yourself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saul is that mirror of your current assumption. His jealousy and hostility toward David represent the resistance your old self has to the new assumption. Saul’s attempts to kill David are the <strong>inner struggle of the old assumption fighting to maintain control</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.”</em><br>
— 1 Samuel 18:9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This watchful jealousy symbolises the old self’s fearful awareness of the emerging new assumption.</p>
<h3>David: The New Assumption, the Wish Fulfilled Self</h3>
<p>David is the symbol of your <strong>new assumption</strong>, the wish fulfilled, the state of consciousness you now inhabit in imagination. He is the “anointed one” — the creative state born from your inner conviction and faith in the law of assumption.</p>
<p>Neville states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and your assumption hardens into fact.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David’s victories over Goliath and other enemies represent the triumph of your new assumption over the giants of doubt and disbelief. To live as David is to <strong>live fully in the new assumption</strong>, embodying the state of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“David said to the Philistine, ‘You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts... This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand.’”</em><br>
— 1 Samuel 17:45-46</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the voice of the new assumption — confident, victorious, and assured of its power.</p>
<p>When you assume David’s identity in imagination, you are affirming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM</a> that which I desire to be.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Drama Between Saul and David: The Battle of Assumptions</h3>
<p>This story is not a historical event but a spiritual and psychological drama within your own mind. The conflict between Saul and David is the tension between your <strong>old assumption</strong> and your <strong>new assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Neville explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You cannot assume what you do not believe. The old self must be dethroned by the new assumption.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saul’s jealousy and persecution of David symbolise the old self’s effort to suppress the new assumption. Yet, the law of assumption requires that the new self, represented by David, reigns supreme in consciousness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him but had departed from Saul.”</em><br>
— 1 Samuel 18:12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse shows how the old assumption loses its power when the new assumption is fully embraced.</p>
<h3>The Sworn Oath: Commitment to the New Assumption</h3>
<p>David was sworn to Saul, symbolising the commitment your old self makes to the new assumption. This is the inner oath you take when you truly accept and live as your wish fulfilled.</p>
<p>Neville instructs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and persist therein until your subconscious accepts it as true.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as his own soul.”</em><br>
— 1 Samuel 18:3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonathan’s covenant with David represents the <strong>binding promise</strong> of the old self (Saul’s house) to the new assumption. This inner agreement ensures the subconscious is ready to align with the new state.</p>
<h3>Practical Steps: Living as David Within</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify your “Saul” — the old assumption, the current state of consciousness holding you to “what is.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vividly assume yourself as “David,” living in the end, victorious in your new assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persist in this feeling until your subconscious fully accepts your new state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand that the conflict between old and new is part of the process; victory belongs to the one who remains faithful to the law of assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>David and Saul represent the inner states of consciousness — the <strong>old self bound by the old assumption</strong> and the <strong>new self living the wish fulfilled</strong>. Neville Goddard’s teaching on the law of assumption invites you to become David, to embody your new assumption fully, and to patiently outlast the resistance of Saul, the old self. When you persist in this way, your outer world will inevitably reflect the kingdom you have assumed within.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
