<h1>The Compound Unity of Elohim:  Alpha and Omega</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p></p><p>When I first encountered Neville Goddard’s teachings, I found it difficult to fully grasp his meaning behind <a href="elohim-god.html">Elohim being a compound unity</a>. I thought it meant that each individual human was just physically separate, yet still part of <a href="elohim-god.html">one collective God.</a> In hindsight, this wasn’t a misunderstanding — it was the beginning of a glimpse into its multi-level, 'wheels within wheels' meaning."</p><p>The Bible’s use of the plural form <em>Elohim</em> (Genesis 1:26 "let <i><b>us</b></i>") points directly to this mystery. Humanity is not a scattering of unrelated beings, but the manifold expression of one divine source: the "I AM". On one level, each of us is an individualised aspect of the One God. We live distinct lives, shaped by personal experiences and seeming separations, yet at the core, we share a single Being — the God of imagination.</p><p>But the unity is deeper still.<br/>Not only are we outwardly part of one <a href="elohim-god.html">collective God, but within each of us, the <em>individual consciousness</em></a> — the imagination that shapes and perceives our world — is the very operation of God Himself. Every moment of imagining, desiring, and assuming springs from the same creative power. Thus, Elohim reflects a dual structure: a compound unity expressed across all of humanity, and an internal unity within each human, whose imagination is the bridge back to divine awareness.</p><p>This dual nature mirrors the ancient mystery captured in the phrase, <em>"I am the Alpha and the Omega"</em> — the beginning and the end are one. God unfolds Himself into the diversity of human life and experience, and through conscious awakening, the scattered returns to the original unity. It is not a straight line from beginning to end, but a perfect circuit: an eternal movement of going out into form and returning into awareness.</p><p>The vision of God having many eyes, as described in <a href="wheels-within-wheels-symbolism-of-inner.html">Ezekiel’s vision of the wheels within wheels</a>, beautifully expresses this reality. Each "wheel" moves independently and yet is perfectly joined to the others, just as each human being moves through their own individual experiences while still being woven into the whole. The "many eyes" on the wheels show that perception is not limited to a single point of view: the Infinite sees through all, moves through all, lives through all.<br/>The wheels within wheels symbolise this perfect, intricate unity: many movements, many directions, yet one divine organism powered by the breath of life — imagination.</p><p>We are not fragments drifting in isolation.<br/>We are the many eyes of God, the many imaginations of the One Imagination.<br/>The separation we perceive is the very stage upon which unity reveals itself — when we recognise that all things, both within and without, are held together by the same invisible thread: I AM.</p><p>This cycle of unfolding and return can be pictured in the symbol of infinity (∞) — a continuous movement where beginning and end flow seamlessly into one another.<br/>In the same way, the journey of God through individuation and reunion is an endless revealing of the One Being to itself. The infinity of existence is not a cold repetition, but the living breath of God: the continual outpouring of life and its eternal return to conscious unity.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
