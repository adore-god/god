<h1>Preparing the Heart: Lessons from Rehoboam to Abijah</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>

<p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not a record of secular history, but a <strong>psychological drama</strong> unfolding within the reader. Every character, kingdom, and event represents <strong>states rising to forefront of consciousness</strong> or processes of the imagination. When read symbolically, these verses from 2 Chronicles show patterns of inner conflict, neglect of inner growth, and the shifting, adjustment and growth of the self.</p>
<hr>

<blockquote>
"And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord." — 2 Chronicles 12:14 KJV
</blockquote>

<p>“Evil” here is not moral wrongdoing. It refers to <strong>failing to align with imagination</strong>, which Neville calls the “I AM.” Rehoboam represents a <strong>state of consciousness</strong> that refuses to train the mind to focus on the desired state. To “prepare the heart to seek the Lord” means using the reflective mind to dwell in the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Ignoring this inner work results in disorder or stagnation in experience.</p>
<p>The name <strong>Rehoboam</strong> (רְחַבְעָם – <em>Rechav’am</em>) means <em>“he who enlarges the people”</em>. Symbolically, this represents a consciousness focused on external growth—status, influence, visibility—without inner grounding. Fixating on outer gain without preparing the mind leads to fragmentation.</p>
<p>This verse demonstrates a <strong>law of inner causation</strong>: neglecting inner work produces disorder in outer circumstances.</p>
<hr>

<blockquote>
"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually." — 2 Chronicles 12:15 KJV</blockquote>

<p><a href="el/what-the-bible-teaches-you.html">“Books”</a> and <a href="these-are-generations-threshold-of.html">genealogies</a> refer to the <strong>mind that remembers</strong>—the record of repeated thoughts and emotional reactions. “Prophets” and “seers” represent higher insight or imagination noticing patterns in consciousness.</p>
<p>The “wars” between Rehoboam and Jeroboam show <strong>internal conflict</strong>. Jeroboam (יָרָבְעָם – <em>Yarav’am</em>) means <em>“the people will contend”</em> and represents a divided state of mind—resisting integration or new assumptions.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rehoboam</strong>: Outer-focused consciousness, neglecting inner preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Jeroboam</strong>: Conflicted, rebellious mental state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The war between them is the struggle of <strong>opposing assumptions</strong>—old self-image versus new desire, doubt versus faith, or fear versus imagination.</p>
<hr>

<blockquote>
"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead." — 2 Chronicles 12:16 KJV
</blockquote>

<p>“Sleeping with his fathers” signifies the <strong>end of a cycle</strong>—a state of consciousness has run its course. Being buried in the <strong>city of David</strong>, the heart or centre of awareness, shows that even unstable states serve higher inner development.</p>
<p>The rise of <strong>Abijah</strong>, Rehoboam’s son, points to a new state of consciousness. Each “son” represents a successor state—new thoughts and feelings made possible by the passing of the old. Whether Abijah leads to unity or continues division depends on recognising that <strong>imagination is God</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Chronicles vs. Kings: A Practice in the Law of Assumption</strong></h2>
<p>Just like the <a href="el/four-gospels-progressive-attempts.html">four gospels repeat the same scenario four times</a>, 2 Chronicles repeats events from 1 and 2 Kings, but with a focus on what is remembered and internalised, rather than just observed. Kings reports facts—wars, alliances, and succession—but Chronicles highlights the inner, heart-based meaning.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>1 Kings 14</strong>, Rehoboam’s reign is described as political events. In <strong>2 Chronicles 12</strong>, the emphasis is on Rehoboam not preparing his heart, showing the inner cause of failure.</li>
<li>Wars with Jeroboam in Kings are noted historically; in Chronicles, they symbolise the inner conflict between opposing assumptions in consciousness.</li>
<li>Chronicles often notes what gets “recorded” in the prophet’s books—showing how patterns in the mind that remembers solidify and guide future states of being.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading Chronicles trains the reflective mind to <strong>fix assumptions</strong>. Each story repeated, with attention to spiritual meaning, strengthens the inner reality of the desired state. This is like practicing dwelling in a feeling until it shapes your external experience, exactly as the law of assumption describes.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Summary According to Neville Goddard</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rehoboam</strong>: Focused on outer gain without inner preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Jeroboam</strong>: Division, rebellion, and conflicting belief systems within consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>Wars between them</strong>: Internal struggle of old self-image versus new assumption, doubt versus faith.</li>
<li><strong>Prophets and records</strong>: The mind that remembers, noting patterns in imagination.</li>
<li><strong>Death of Rehoboam and rise of Abijah</strong>: Ongoing transformation, preparing for fuller awareness of imagination as God.</li>
<li><strong>Chronicles vs. Kings</strong>: Chronicles is heart-based, showing how reflection and memory train the mind to dwell in assumed states and strengthen the law of assumption.</li>
