<h1>John: Jesus Talks of the Helper and Comforter</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>John 14:15–31 contains a deep conversation between <a href="jesus-his-disciples-psychological-drama.html">Jesus and His disciples</a>, filled with promise, comfort, and guidance. Through Neville Goddard’s teaching, we can interpret this passage not as history, but as a revelation of the same law of consciousness first unveiled in Genesis.</p><p>In Genesis 2:23, <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Woman is called forth as the <em>helper</em></a> of Man, symbolising the subconscious that receives and embodies what the conscious conceives. In John 14, Jesus speaks of the <em>Comforter</em>—also called Helper—who fulfils this same role within the mind. Both Woman and Comforter point to the same truth: manifestation is born when the conscious “I AM” is joined to its creative partner, the subconscious imagination.</p><p>Let’s explore this passage verse by verse.</p><hr><h3>John 14:15</h3><blockquote>“If you love me, keep my commandments."</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
To love <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> is to embrace the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">creative law of I AM within you</a> through <a href="genesis-224-love.html">love</a>. The commandments here are not external rules but inner laws of manifestation: to <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</a>. Loving Jesus means living by the law of imagination.</p><hr><h3>John 14:16</h3><blockquote>“And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you forever.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
The Comforter is the Helper—the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagination within you that abides forever</a>. This directly recalls Genesis 2:18–23, where Woman is given to Adam as “a helper suitable for him.” In Neville’s interpretation, <a href="genesis-126-man.html">Man is conscious awareness</a>, and <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Woman is the subconscious womb that embodies what Man conceives</a>.</p><p>So too with the Comforter: the Father (divine consciousness) provides this eternal companion to your conscious I AM. The Comforter is not separate from you but is bone of your bones, flesh of your flesh, I AM that I AM—the inner helper by which every assumption becomes flesh.</p><hr><h3>John 14:17</h3><blockquote>“Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
The Spirit of truth is your own imagination. The outer world cannot perceive it because it searches externally, while truth is inward. Just as Woman was taken “out of Man,” manifestation emerges out of consciousness, unseen until it takes form. The Comforter dwells in you as the subconscious helper, receiving and embodying the state you assume.</p><hr><h3>John 14:18</h3><blockquote>“I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> promises the abiding presence of the Helper. This echoes Genesis, where Man is not left alone but completed by Woman. Likewise, you are never left without your Comforter: your imagination is always with you, ready to give form to your assumptions.</p><hr><h3>John 14:19</h3><blockquote>“Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
The world cannot see imagination at work, but you know it within. As long as imagination lives, so do you. This unseen life is the same mystery by which Eve was called “the mother of all living”—manifestation is birthed from the hidden power of the subconscious.</p><hr><h3>John 14:20</h3><blockquote>“At that day you shall know that I AM in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Here is the union of all aspects of consciousness: the Father (absolute awareness), the Son (assumption), and the Helper (subconscious imagination). This is the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">marriage of Man and Woman</a>, conscious and subconscious, out of which manifestation is born.</p><hr><h3>John 14:21</h3><blockquote>“He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.”</blockquote><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
To keep the commandments is to persist in the assumption of the wish fulfilled. This fidelity to imagination is what joins the conscious “Adam” to the subconscious “Eve.” Out of that union, manifestation comes forth as the Son revealing Himself in your world.<hr><h3>John 14:22</h3><blockquote>“Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself unto us, and not unto the world?”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
The world sees only appearances, not causes. But you who understand the law know manifestation comes from within. As Woman emerges from Man, so every visible state emerges from your invisible assumption.</p><hr><h3>John 14:23</h3><blockquote>“Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
When you align with imagination, you draw both Father and Son into abiding union within. This is the <a href="scrolls/label-shepherd-and-lamb-series.html">true marriage of the Lamb</a>: conscious I AM and imagination as helper joined together, dwelling in you as one creative abode.</p><hr><h3>John 14:24</h3><blockquote>“He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
To disregard imagination is to miss the law of life. The word is not external command but the eternal truth of consciousness. Refusing Woman is refusing yourself; ignoring the Comforter is ignoring the very power that gives birth to your world.</p><hr><h3>John 14:25</h3><blockquote>“These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Jesus speaks not of a past event but a present reality. The creative law is always here, always now. Just as Woman was present in Adam all along—waiting to be called forth—so the Comforter is already within you, awaiting recognition.</p><hr><h3>John 14:26</h3><blockquote>“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
The Comforter is the Holy Spirit—the inward helper. Just as Eve is the mother of all living, the hidden helper mothers every manifestation, receiving the seed of assumption and bringing it to remembrance. The Holy Spirit fulfils the same role as Woman: she is consciousness embodied, your assumption made flesh.</p><hr><h3>John 14:27</h3><blockquote>“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
The peace of I AM is knowing your assumption is already gestating in the womb of Woman, the Comforter. Unlike the fleeting peace of circumstances, this peace rests in the certainty that the law of creation never fails.</p><hr><h3>John 14:28</h3><blockquote>“Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
The Son returns to the Father, just as every conscious seed must return into the deep to be conceived. The conscious thought (Adam/Jesus) is surrendered into the Father (divine awareness), where the subconscious helper (Eve/Comforter) receives it and brings it to life.</p><hr><h3>John 14:29</h3><blockquote>“And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you might believe.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
This is the principle of assuming the wish fulfilled. You know it before it appears, because the seed has already been planted in the subconscious helper. When the fruit comes forth, you recognise the law at work.</p><hr><h3>John 14:30</h3><blockquote>“Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
The prince of this world is the outer distraction that tempts you to look away from imagination. But when you know the Comforter within, the outer has no hold. The helper is faithful; she cannot but bring forth what is sown.</p><hr><h3>John 14:31</h3><blockquote>“But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.”</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
To love the Father is to live the law of imagination. The Son consents, the Helper conceives, and manifestation is born. This is the eternal marriage: conscious and subconscious joined as one, arising to bring forth the life you name.</p><hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>John 14:15–31, read with Neville Goddard’s insight, is not separate from Genesis 2:23 but its continuation. Woman and Comforter are the same symbol: the imagining helper, the womb of creation, your imagination at work.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Adam and Woman are consciousness and manifestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus and the Comforter</a> are saving oneself through assumption and imagination.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Bible tells one story: every <a href="scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html">crucifixion</a> of desire (assumption fixed) is followed by resurrection (manifestation revealed). You are always both the Man who conceives and the Woman who embodies, the Son who assumes and the Comforter who fulfils.</p><p>By embracing the I AM within and honouring your eternal Helper, you unlock the peace, power, and certainty of creation itself.</p><hr><p>
</p><p>The word for ‘helper’ in Genesis (ʿēzer) and the word for ‘Comforter’ in John (paraklētos), though from different languages, both describe the indispensable, indwelling helper of manifestation</p>
