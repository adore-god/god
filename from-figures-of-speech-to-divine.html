<h1>The Disciples: Jesus Moving Between the Father and the World</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In John 16:25–33, <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> speaks intimately to His <a href="elohim-god.html">disciples</a> of future trials, inner peace, and their shared divine connection. When read through Neville Goddard’s understanding of <a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagination and consciousness</a>, these verses reveal a psychological journey: a move from external dependence to the discovery of the movement of imagination within.</p><h3>Asking in the State of Imagination</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>"I have said these things to you in  figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but will tell you plainly of the Father. In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father for you; for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God."</strong><br>
(John 16:25–27)</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville saw "asking in my name" not as using certain words but as <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">entering a new state of consciousness</a> — the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>. Here, you no longer rely on an external intermediary but claim oneness with the Father, which Neville identified as your own wonderful human <a href="genesis-126-man.html">imagination</a>.</p><p>The <a href="label-word-of-god-series.html" class="noTag">"figures of speech" </a>are symbolic stories, pointing beyond literal meaning to hidden spiritual truths. Neville taught that the Bible, like a parable, invites us to uncover these inner meanings and recognise the creative power of our own awareness.</p><p>The <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">"name" of Jesus</a> here symbolises a state of consciousness: the feeling of already being or having what you desire. When you move into this state, your request is fulfilled because it is already assumed.</p><h3>The Journey Back to Source</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>"I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father."</strong><br>
(John 16:28)</p>
</blockquote><p>This movement describes the eternal cycle of manifestation. We leave the pure formless imagination (the Father), enter the world of appearances, and return again to the source within.</p><p>For Neville, "the world" symbolises outer circumstances shaped by our past assumptions. Returning "to the Father" is coming home to the creative centre — your imagination. Only here can you renew and transform your experiences.</p><h3>The Awakening to Realisation</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>"His disciples said, 'Ah, now you are speaking plainly and not in figures of speech! Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you; by this we believe that you came from God.'"</strong><br>
(John 16:29–30)</p>
</blockquote><p>In this moment, the disciples experience a deep clarity. Neville understood the disciples as personifications of your inner faculties — faith, love, imagination, will, and more — each serving as a trusted, supportive friend rather than a strict ruler or judge.</p><p>These inner companions help sustain your chosen state. When they "understand plainly," it symbolises your mind uniting in full agreement and support of your new identity.</p><p>This mirrors the meaning of <em>Elohim</em> — often translated as "God," but also meaning "mighty ones," "rulers," or "principles." In a psychological sense, <em>Elohim</em> is the collective creative powers within you. Your disciples, as familiar and loyal aspects of your mind, form a kind of inner council that backs your assumptions with faith and feeling.</p><h3>The Test of Faith</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>"Jesus answered them, 'Do you now believe? The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.'"</strong><br>
(John 16:31–32)</p>
</blockquote><p>The scattering of the disciples represents moments when your inner faculties lose focus. In life, challenges may cause your supportive thoughts to scatter — yet the core "I AM" remains unwavering.</p><p>Neville would say: even when your mental companions seem absent, the true creative source — your own wonderful imagination — remains ever-present and steadfast.</p><h3>Overcoming the World with Imagination</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>"I have said this to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you face persecution. But take courage; I have overcome the world."</strong><br>
(John 16:33)</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, "the world" stands for outer conditions and appearances that often oppose your inner desires. Neville taught that to "overcome the world" is to remain loyal to your assumed state despite appearances.</p><p>Jesus’ overcoming becomes a symbol of your own ability to master circumstances by standing firm in imagination. True peace is found not by changing the outer world directly, but by transforming your inner state — assuming the feeling of your wish fulfilled.</p><h3>Conclusion: The Inner Companions of Faith</h3><p>John 16:25–33 reveals an intimate guide to our relationship with the divine within. Jesus’ words point us away from external reliance and toward our own imagination, the true Elohim — the collective power and principle of creation within.</p><p>The disciples represent the trusted inner faculties that uphold our chosen state. Though they may falter, your central awareness — the I AM — never leaves.</p><p>When you remember that you and your imagination are one, you, too, "overcome the world." This is the essence of peace, mastery, and divine realisation.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html" class="noTag">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-parable-series.html" class="noTag">Parable Series</a> | <a href="label-john-series.html" class="noTag">John Series</a></p>
