<h1>The End of the Age—of Outer Authority</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><i>A Neville Goddard Reading of Mark 13:3–13</i></p>
<p>Most Christians read Mark 13 as a terrifying vision of the world’s collapse. Popular translations like the ESV label it “Signs of the End of the Age,” and the assumption is that Jesus is predicting catastrophic external events. But as Neville Goddard so often insisted, the Bible isn’t a book of historical forecasts—it is a psychological drama unfolding within you.</p>
<p>In Mark 13:3–13, Jesus sits on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple—a clear symbol of contemplation and elevation of consciousness. The disciples ask him privately,<br/>
“Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?”</p>
<p>But the answer is not about a date on the calendar.<br/>
It’s about a shift in identity.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>False Messiahs: Your Misplaced Hope in Outer Methods</h2>
<p>Jesus warns:<br/>
“Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he!’ and they will lead many astray.” (v. 6)</p>
<p>Neville would interpret this as mistaking outer techniques, people, or institutions for the true “I AM.” The false messiah is not a person, but any belief that salvation or transformation comes from something outside yourself. The moment you say, “I will be free when my situation changes,” you’ve been led astray.</p>
<p>The true Messiah is “I AM”—your own wonderful human imagination. As Neville says,<br/>
“Your I AMness is God.”</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Wars and Earthquakes: Inner Turmoil and the Shaking of Old Beliefs</h2>
<p>“When you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed… nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.” (vv. 7–8)</p>
<p>These aren’t geopolitical events.<br/>
They symbolise internal conflict—wars between states of consciousness. One self-concept clashes with another: lack fights with abundance, fear with faith, resentment with love. “Earthquakes” are symbolic of foundational beliefs trembling—old structures collapsing to make room for the new.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Birth Pains, Not Doom</h2>
<p>“These are but the beginning of the birth pains.” (v. 8)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neville often pointed to this idea: the pain of transformation is not punishment, but labour.<br/>
Your world shakes, not because it is ending, but because a new identity is being born. Something greater is trying to come through you—your awareness of being is pressing to be expressed in a new form.</p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.30em;"><b>The Metaphor of Childbirth in Neville's Framework</b></span></p><p dir="ltr">In Neville's teachings, transformation is like childbirth. Just as the birth of a child involves pain and effort, the emergence of a new identity requires breaking free from old thought patterns. This struggle isn't punishment; it's the necessary labour of change.</p><p dir="ltr">Consider the biblical story of Eve. After the fall, she is told that she will experience pain in childbirth, symbolising the struggle inherent in bringing new life into the world. </p><p dir="ltr"></p><blockquote>To the woman he said, Great will be your pain in childbirth; in sorrow will your children come to birth; still your desire will be for your husband, but he will be your master. - Genesis 3:16</blockquote><p></p><p dir="ltr">This parallel highlights that transformation—whether spiritual, mental, or emotional—is rarely free from discomfort. The pain represents the shedding of the old and the pressing forward of something new.</p><p>
</p><p dir="ltr">As you shift your consciousness, resistance arises from the subconscious mind, trying to hold onto the old self. However, just as a mother’s labour pain leads to the joy of new life, the discomfort of transformation signals the arrival of a new, empowered identity. The pain is not the end—it’s the beginning of a higher state of being ready to express itself in your life.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Real Betrayal: Inner Division</h2>
<p>“Brother will deliver brother over to death… children will rise against parents.” (v. 12)</p>
<p>These disturbing images symbolise the conflict between former self-identities and the new assumption you are trying to live by. The “brother” is the familiar thought. The “parent” is your inherited worldview. The moment you claim a new state, everything within you that identified with the old begins to rebel. Your subconscious will pull up every reason why your new assumption is “dangerous.”</p>
<p>This isn’t evil—it’s resistance from the past being exposed.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>“You Will Be Hated”: The Rejection of Your Inner Shift</h2>
<p>“You will be hated by all for my name’s sake.” (v. 13)</p>
<p>To take the name of “I AM” in a new way is to claim a new state of being.<br/>
That shift is often met with rejection—not just from people around you, but from your own self-image, habits, and beliefs.<br/>
You are hated by “all” the elements of your old self.<br/>
But this is proof the shift is working.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Endurance Isn’t Passive Waiting</h2>
<p>“But the one who endures to the end will be saved.” (v. 13)</p>
<p>Neville’s definition of endurance is not struggle—it is faithfulness.<br/>
Remaining loyal to the assumption that what you have imagined is already true.<br/>
You are “saved” not from hellfire, but from misidentifying yourself with limitation.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Conclusion: The “End of the Age” is the End of Believing in External Power</h2>
<p>Mark 13 is not about the collapse of the planet.<br/>
It is about the collapse of the external as your source.<br/>
It marks the end of the age of believing that the temple—outer ritual, external validation, fixed appearances—is the seat of truth.</p>
<p>The words attributed to Jesus are not the proclamations of a historical man foretelling destruction.<br/>
They are the voice of your own awakened imagination calling you to abandon belief in appearances.</p>
<p>“Jesus” is the pattern of salvation—the revelation that your own I AMness is God.<br/>
The message comes not from above, but from within.<br/>
It is your awareness speaking to itself, warning that as you move toward identifying with your ideal, all that once defined you will protest.</p>
<p>It is not the end of the world.<br/>
It is the end of the world as you once accepted it—<br/>
and the beginning of the one you now assume to be true.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
