<main class="content">
<p><i>A Neville Goddard Reading of Mark 13:3&ndash;13</i></p>
<p>Most Christians read Mark 13 as a terrifying vision of the world&rsquo;s collapse. Popular translations like the ESV label it &ldquo;Signs of the End of the Age,&rdquo; and the assumption is that Jesus is predicting catastrophic external events. But as Neville Goddard so often insisted, the Bible isn&rsquo;t a book of historical forecasts&mdash;it is a psychological drama unfolding within you.</p>
<p>In Mark 13:3&ndash;13, Jesus sits on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple&mdash;a clear symbol of contemplation and elevation of consciousness. The disciples ask him privately,<br/>
&ldquo;Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the answer is not about a date on the calendar.<br/>
It&rsquo;s about a shift in identity.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>False Messiahs: Your Misplaced Hope in Outer Methods</h2>
<p>Jesus warns:<br/>
&ldquo;Many will come in my name, saying, &lsquo;I am he!&rsquo; and they will lead many astray.&rdquo; (v. 6)</p>
<p>Neville would interpret this as mistaking outer techniques, people, or institutions for the true &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo; The false messiah is not a person, but any belief that salvation or transformation comes from something outside yourself. The moment you say, &ldquo;I will be free when my situation changes,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve been led astray.</p>
<p>The true Messiah is &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;&mdash;your own wonderful human imagination. As Neville says,<br/>
&ldquo;Your I AMness is God.&rdquo;</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Wars and Earthquakes: Inner Turmoil and the Shaking of Old Beliefs</h2>
<p>&ldquo;When you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed&hellip; nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.&rdquo; (vv. 7&ndash;8)</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t geopolitical events.<br/>
They symbolise internal conflict&mdash;wars between states of consciousness. One self-concept clashes with another: lack fights with abundance, fear with faith, resentment with love. &ldquo;Earthquakes&rdquo; are symbolic of foundational beliefs trembling&mdash;old structures collapsing to make room for the new.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Birth Pains, Not Doom</h2>
<p>&ldquo;These are but the beginning of the birth pains.&rdquo; (v. 8)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neville often pointed to this idea: the pain of transformation is not punishment, but labour.<br/>
Your world shakes, not because it is ending, but because a new identity is being born. Something greater is trying to come through you&mdash;your awareness of being is pressing to be expressed in a new form.</p><p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.30em;"><b>The Metaphor of Childbirth in Neville's Framework</b></span></p><p dir="ltr">In Neville's teachings, transformation is like childbirth. Just as the birth of a child involves pain and effort, the emergence of a new identity requires breaking free from old thought patterns. This struggle isn't punishment; it's the necessary labour of change.</p><p dir="ltr">Consider the biblical story of Eve. After the fall, she is told that she will experience pain in childbirth, symbolising the struggle inherent in bringing new life into the world.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"></p><blockquote>To the woman he said, Great will be your pain in childbirth; in sorrow will your children come to birth; still your desire will be for your husband, but he will be your master. - Genesis 3:16</blockquote><p></p><p dir="ltr">This parallel highlights that transformation&mdash;whether spiritual, mental, or emotional&mdash;is rarely free from discomfort. The pain represents the shedding of the old and the pressing forward of something new.</p><p>
</p><p dir="ltr">As you shift your consciousness, resistance arises from the subconscious mind, trying to hold onto the old self. However, just as a mother&rsquo;s labour pain leads to the joy of new life, the discomfort of transformation signals the arrival of a new, empowered identity. The pain is not the end&mdash;it&rsquo;s the beginning of a higher state of being ready to express itself in your life.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Real Betrayal: Inner Division</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Brother will deliver brother over to death&hellip; children will rise against parents.&rdquo; (v. 12)</p>
<p>These disturbing images symbolise the conflict between former self-identities and the new assumption you are trying to live by. The &ldquo;brother&rdquo; is the familiar thought. The &ldquo;parent&rdquo; is your inherited worldview. The moment you claim a new state, everything within you that identified with the old begins to rebel. Your subconscious will pull up every reason why your new assumption is &ldquo;dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t evil&mdash;it&rsquo;s resistance from the past being exposed.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>&ldquo;You Will Be Hated&rdquo;: The Rejection of Your Inner Shift</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You will be hated by all for my name&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; (v. 13)</p>
<p>To take the name of &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; in a new way is to claim a new state of being.<br/>
That shift is often met with rejection&mdash;not just from people around you, but from your own self-image, habits, and beliefs.<br/>
You are hated by &ldquo;all&rdquo; the elements of your old self.<br/>
But this is proof the shift is working.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Endurance Isn&rsquo;t Passive Waiting</h2>
<p>&ldquo;But the one who endures to the end will be saved.&rdquo; (v. 13)</p>
<p>Neville&rsquo;s definition of endurance is not struggle&mdash;it is faithfulness.<br/>
Remaining loyal to the assumption that what you have imagined is already true.<br/>
You are &ldquo;saved&rdquo; not from hellfire, but from misidentifying yourself with limitation.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Conclusion: The &ldquo;End of the Age&rdquo; is the End of Believing in External Power</h2>
<p>Mark 13 is not about the collapse of the planet.<br/>
It is about the collapse of the external as your source.<br/>
It marks the end of the age of believing that the temple&mdash;outer ritual, external validation, fixed appearances&mdash;is the seat of truth.</p>
<p>The words attributed to Jesus are not the proclamations of a historical man foretelling destruction.<br/>
They are the voice of your own awakened imagination calling you to abandon belief in appearances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; is the pattern of salvation&mdash;the revelation that your own I AMness is God.<br/>
The message comes not from above, but from within.<br/>
It is your awareness speaking to itself, warning that as you move toward identifying with your ideal, all that once defined you will protest.</p>
<p>It is not the end of the world.<br/>
It is the end of the world as you once accepted it&mdash;<br/>
and the beginning of the one you now assume to be true.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
