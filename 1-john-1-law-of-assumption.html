<h1>1 John 1 &amp; The Law of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><strong>A Neville Goddard-Inspired Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>The First Epistle of John opens not as a letter of doctrine, but as a bold declaration of <em>experience</em>. According to Neville Goddard, the Bible is not history, but a psychological drama. And in that spirit, 1 John 1 becomes a beautiful guide to applying the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>—that <em>imagining creates reality</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s explore it verse by verse.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 1 — The Word Made Tangible</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“That which was from the beginning... our hands have handled, of the Word of life.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This “Word” is not a person, but the creative principle: <strong>assumption</strong>. When you assume something to be true—even if unseen—you “handle” the Word. To hear, see, and touch this Word means to <em>experience</em> the power of imagination. This is creation at its root.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 2 — Life Manifested Through Assumption</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The life was manifested... and was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manifestation is simply life taking form from within. “With the Father” implies it existed <em>in consciousness</em>. The Father is your <strong>I AM</strong>, and manifestation is the child of assumption. Neville might say: <em>“All things exist in the human imagination.”</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 3 — Shared Consciousness</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“That ye also may have fellowship with us... and with his Son Jesus Christ.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn’t about joining a religion—it’s about joining a <strong>state</strong>. To have “fellowship” with those who live by the law is to understand: <em>assumption is salvation</em>. Jesus, as the Son, symbolises the <strong>fulfilled idea made manifest</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 4 — Joy as the Result</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“These things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joy is the natural fruit of creative confidence. When you realise you can assume the best and watch it take form, joy overflows—not because conditions improved, but because <strong>you did</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 5 — God Is Light (Awareness)</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God is your <strong>awareness</strong>, pure and creative. Light means clarity—seeing what you want, assuming it, and refusing to waver. “No darkness” means no confusion or contradiction. The law always works.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 6 — Walk the Talk</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie...”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To claim you believe in imagination, but dwell in fear, is self-deception. Darkness means continuing to imagine the unwanted. Neville called it <em>living in the state of doubt</em>. Integrity of imagination is required.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 7 — Cleansed by the Creative Act</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Walk in the light... and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To walk in light is to <strong>persist in the desired state</strong>. The “blood” symbolises <em>life</em>, and Jesus is your assumption made flesh. You are cleansed not by ritual, but by <em>moving into a new state</em>. You are made whole by living the new identity.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 8 — Admit the Misuse</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves...”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sin, in Neville’s teaching, is simply <strong>missing the mark</strong>—imagining what you do not wish to experience. We’ve all done it. Awareness of this is key; denial keeps you stuck.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 9 — Revision and Redemption</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If we confess our sins... he is faithful to forgive us.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confession is not shame—it’s <strong>recognition</strong>. The moment you revise an inner state, you are <em>cleansed</em>. To forgive is to <em>let go</em> of the old assumption. You are free the instant you shift your focus.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 10 — Imagination Requires Responsibility</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If we say that we have not sinned... his word is not in us.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To live by imagination is to take responsibility. If you pretend you’ve never misused the law, you distance yourself from its power. The “Word” (assumption) must live <strong>within you</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
