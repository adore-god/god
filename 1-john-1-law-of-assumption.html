<h1>1 John 1 &amp; The Law of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p><strong>A Neville Goddard-Inspired Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>The First Epistle of John opens not as a letter of doctrine, but as a bold declaration of <em>experience</em>. According to Neville Goddard, the Bible is not history, but a psychological drama. And in that spirit, 1 John 1 becomes a beautiful guide to applying the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>&mdash;that <em>imagining creates reality</em>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore it verse by verse.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 1 &mdash; The Word Made Tangible</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;That which was from the beginning... our hands have handled, of the Word of life.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &ldquo;Word&rdquo; is not a person, but the creative principle: <strong>assumption</strong>. When you assume something to be true&mdash;even if unseen&mdash;you &ldquo;handle&rdquo; the Word. To hear, see, and touch this Word means to <em>experience</em> the power of imagination. This is creation at its root.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 2 &mdash; Life Manifested Through Assumption</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The life was manifested... and was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manifestation is simply life taking form from within. &ldquo;With the Father&rdquo; implies it existed <em>in consciousness</em>. The Father is your <strong>I AM</strong>, and manifestation is the child of assumption. Neville might say: <em>&ldquo;All things exist in the human imagination.&rdquo;</em></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 3 &mdash; Shared Consciousness</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;That ye also may have fellowship with us... and with his Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about joining a religion&mdash;it&rsquo;s about joining a <strong>state</strong>. To have &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; with those who live by the law is to understand: <em>assumption is salvation</em>. Jesus, as the Son, symbolises the <strong>fulfilled idea made manifest</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 4 &mdash; Joy as the Result</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;These things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joy is the natural fruit of creative confidence. When you realise you can assume the best and watch it take form, joy overflows&mdash;not because conditions improved, but because <strong>you did</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 5 &mdash; God Is Light (Awareness)</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God is your <strong>awareness</strong>, pure and creative. Light means clarity&mdash;seeing what you want, assuming it, and refusing to waver. &ldquo;No darkness&rdquo; means no confusion or contradiction. The law always works.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 6 &mdash; Walk the Talk</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie...&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To claim you believe in imagination, but dwell in fear, is self-deception. Darkness means continuing to imagine the unwanted. Neville called it <em>living in the state of doubt</em>. Integrity of imagination is required.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 7 &mdash; Cleansed by the Creative Act</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Walk in the light... and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To walk in light is to <strong>persist in the desired state</strong>. The &ldquo;blood&rdquo; symbolises <em>life</em>, and Jesus is your assumption made flesh. You are cleansed not by ritual, but by <em>moving into a new state</em>. You are made whole by living the new identity.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 8 &mdash; Admit the Misuse</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves...&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sin, in Neville&rsquo;s teaching, is simply <strong>missing the mark</strong>&mdash;imagining what you do not wish to experience. We&rsquo;ve all done it. Awareness of this is key; denial keeps you stuck.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 9 &mdash; Revision and Redemption</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;If we confess our sins... he is faithful to forgive us.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confession is not shame&mdash;it&rsquo;s <strong>recognition</strong>. The moment you revise an inner state, you are <em>cleansed</em>. To forgive is to <em>let go</em> of the old assumption. You are free the instant you shift your focus.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Verse 10 &mdash; Imagination Requires Responsibility</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;If we say that we have not sinned... his word is not in us.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To live by imagination is to take responsibility. If you pretend you&rsquo;ve never misused the law, you distance yourself from its power. The &ldquo;Word&rdquo; (assumption) must live <strong>within you</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
