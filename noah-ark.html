<h1>Noah's Ark: Male and Female, Two by Two</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>

<p>The Bible begins with Adam naming the animals. In psychological terms, this is the mind’s first stage: becoming aware of its own moods, instincts, and reactions. To “name” something is to define it, and to define is to give it form. This is the earliest expression of consciousness organising itself.</p>

<p><a class="noTag" href="genesis-127-male-and-female-he-created.html">Genesis 1:27 introduces the next step</a>: <em>“male and female created he them.”</em> This is the foundation of manifestation. It does not refer to physical gender, but to how creation works internally: every idea (male) must join with the feeling of its reality (female) before it can take shape. This same principle becomes more explicit in Genesis 2:24:</p> <blockquote>“they shall be one flesh.”</blockquote>
<p>
In modern terms, your thought and the feeling that matches it must come together as a single condition before anything can appear in your world.</p>

<p>When the story reaches <a href="scrolls/label-noah-series.html">Noah</a>, the process becomes more concrete. The ark represents a chosen state of being held steady while old, undesired states fall away. The animals entering two by two show the same pattern law of creation echoed throughout the Bible: what is unpaired (an idea without the matching feeling) cannot continue; what is paired survives and becomes part of the new "man".</p>

<p>The narrative then shifts from the ark to the tabernacle in the wilderness — a temporary dwelling. This symbolises imagination carrying assumptions through changing life conditions. Eventually, this becomes <a href="building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html">Solomon’s temple</a>, a fixed and permanent structure. What began as loose, shifting inner states becomes a stable, established assumption that finally shows itself outwardly.</p>

<p>The progression is straightforward:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Adam</strong> — becoming aware of and naming inner states.</li>
<li><strong>Noah</strong> — joining thought and feeling so creation can occur.</li>
<li><strong>Tabernacle / Temple</strong> — holding an assumption until it becomes solid and lasting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each stage is about the development of consciousness, not physical buildings or animals. The male and female of Genesis 1:27, the “one flesh” of Genesis 2:24, and the pairs in Noah’s ark all point to the same law: nothing is created until thought and feeling agree. The Bible shows this progression again and again, leading to its final expression — <strong>Jesus, the Word made flesh</strong> — the complete embodiment of assumption becoming reality.</p>
