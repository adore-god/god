<h1>Sword: Cutting Away All That Obstructs the Law</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The sword appears throughout Scripture as a striking symbol, yet its true meaning is often lost to literal readings. In traditional doctrine, it is seen as an instrument of divine wrath or violence. But as Neville Goddard insists, the Bible is not a historical record of outer acts; it is a psychological drama, revealing the inner <a href="elohim-god.html">operations of the mind.</a></p><p>The sword is the faculty of discrimination. It is the sharp awareness that cuts away all that obstructs the law — the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">inner law that your assumption</a>, when sustained, becomes your reality. It is the power to sever false identities, doubts, and limiting beliefs that keep you tied to undesired states.</p><p>Hebrews 4:12 describes it precisely:</p><blockquote>
<p>"For the word of <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit... and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the sword is not a weapon against others, but a tool for separating what belongs to your chosen state from what does not. It is judgement — not as condemnation, but as selection. To judge rightly is to choose what you will serve, to fix your mind on the state you wish to embody. “Choose you this day whom ye will serve” (Joshua 24:15) is this act of inner division.</p><p>When <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> says, </p><p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>"I came not to bring peace, but a sword"</em> (Matthew 10:34), </blockquote><p></p><p>he reveals that true transformation demands inner conflict. The old self must be cut away. Family ties, habitual thoughts, and accepted limitations — all are challenged when you align with the truth that “I Am” is God in action.</p><p>Righteousness, in Neville’s terms, is not moral correctness but right consciousness: the state of being aligned with your assumption. The sword is the means by which you maintain this alignment, cutting away every opposing thought. It is vigilance in imagination, refusing to accept appearances that deny your chosen reality.</p><p>Thus, the sword is not an emblem of fear but of <a href="genesis-47-sin.html" target="_blank">mastery</a>. It is the precise, fearless application of your inner law — the Law of Assumption — to shape your world in accordance with your highest vision.</p>
