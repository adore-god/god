<h1>Psalm 121</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p><strong>"I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help."</strong></p>
<p>Neville Goddard teaches that the "hills" represent the higher states of consciousness—those elevated mental states that offer a broader perspective. By lifting your eyes, you’re turning your awareness inward, recognising that all help comes from within. It's an invitation to connect with the power of your imagination, which shapes your reality.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>"My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth."</strong></p>
<p>The "Lord" is not an external deity but the imaginative power within you. Goddard often stated that God is the "I AM," the creative power in every individual. The heavens and earth represent all the possibilities within your consciousness. When you turn to this inner power, you are tapping into your creative potential to shape your world.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>"He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber."</strong></p>
<p>Your feet represent the path you're on. In Neville’s view, this suggests that as you align your imagination with your true desires, you are securely anchored. Your progress is safeguarded, and the creative power never rests. Even when it seems as though nothing is happening, your imagination is always at work, manifesting your desires in divine timing.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>"The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand."</strong></p>
<p>The "keeper" is your imagination, guarding you against negative thoughts and external circumstances. Your "right hand" signifies your ability to act and create. The "shade" represents protection from the heat of life's struggles, allowing you to maintain inner peace, despite external chaos.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>"The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night."</strong></p>
<p>Day and night symbolise the conscious and subconscious mind. The sun represents the waking, logical state, while the moon represents the subconscious, where deeper thoughts and feelings reside. In Goddard’s interpretation, this line assures that both conscious and subconscious minds will align to support your manifestation, protecting you from negative influences.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>"The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul."</strong></p>
<p>Evil, in Neville’s view, refers to the destructive thoughts and beliefs that arise from doubt and fear. By aligning with your divine imagination, you protect yourself from these limiting beliefs. The preservation of your soul signifies the safeguarding of your true self, the "I AM" within, from all harm.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>"The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore."</strong></p>
<p>This final affirmation reinforces that your journey, both in the physical and spiritual realms, is protected. As you step into new experiences and ventures, you are guided by the creative power within. There is a continuous flow of divine support, ensuring you remain on the path of growth and manifestation.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Psalm 121 is a profound reminder of the divine protection available when we turn to the power of imagination. Neville Goddard’s teachings remind us that we are never alone; our inner awareness, or "I AM," is always with us, guiding and manifesting our desires. By aligning with this higher consciousness, we are assured of a path free from harm and filled with limitless possibilities.</p>
