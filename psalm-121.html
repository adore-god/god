<h1>Psalm 121</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Psalm 121 is written so that the reader <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">forms the desired state in their own mind</a>, guided by David’s voice. <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David represents the mental forming of the beloved assumption</a>. The psalm shows how to lift the state into a <a href="jesus-paradise-pleasure-and-abundance.html">state of joy and pleasure</a>, maintain attention on it, and rely on the Lord to sustain and manifest it. This is a practical guide for exercising the Law of Assumption.</p>
<blockquote>
My eyes are lifted up to the hills: O where will my help come from?
</blockquote>
<p>Lifting your eyes means directing attention to the state you want to assume. The “hills” represent focusing on something positive and kind about yourself. The reader is guided to hold this thought and focus on it, knowing that help comes from the Lord (attention to the 'I AM') sustaining it.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
Your help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
</blockquote>
<p><a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">The “Lord” here represents the sustaining presence of the assumed state.</a> “Heaven and earth” symbolise the full range of possibilities in consciousness. The reader is instructed to align with this presence to begin manifesting the state.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
May he not let your foot be moved: no need of sleep has he who keeps you.
</blockquote>
<p>“Thy foot” symbolises progress in life. By assuming and persisting in the state, the reader’s path is protected. The Lord never stops sustaining the assumption.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
See, the eyes of Israel’s keeper will not be shut in sleep.
</blockquote>
<p>This verse reinforces that the Lord never stops observing and sustaining the assumed state.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade on your right hand.
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord protects and stabilises the assumed state. “Shade” signifies security, and the “right hand” represents the reader’s ability to act from the assumed state.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
You will not be touched by the sun in the day, or by the moon at night.
</blockquote>
<p>“Sun” and “day” represent conscious awareness, while “moon” and “night” represent the subconscious. Alignment with the assumed state protects both parts of the mind, ensuring consistent manifestation.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
The Lord will keep you safe from all evil; he will take care of your soul.
</blockquote>
<p>“Evil” represents doubt, fear, and destructive thoughts. Preserving the “soul” is maintaining the reader’s self-concept in alignment with the assumed state.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
The Lord will keep watch over your going out and your coming in, from this time and for ever.
</blockquote>
<p>This final verse confirms that the assumed state will guide all the reader’s experiences, both outward actions and inner thoughts, continually supporting manifestation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Psalm 121 is a practical teaching on the Law of Assumption. The reader is instructed to form a desired state, lift it into awareness, maintain attention on it, and rely on the Lord to sustain it. By persisting in the assumption, the reader aligns both conscious and subconscious mind, ensuring the state manifests in life. This psalm is a guide for consciously creating and sustaining states that shape reality.</p>
