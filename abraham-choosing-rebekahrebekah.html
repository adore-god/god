<h1>Abraham: Choosing Rebekah</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>The account of <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a> selecting a wife for Isaac is more than a historical narrative. Within a psychological and metaphysical framework — particularly as understood through Neville Goddard’s teachings — it outlines a process of <b>assumption</b>: one that involves faith, imagination, feeling, and divine law working in harmony.</p><p>This isn’t a story about romance. It is a symbolic account of how the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">mind must bind itself to the <strong>correct inner state</strong></a> in order to bring forth what has been promised.</p><hr/><h3>Abraham as the Initiating Authority of Faith</h3><p>Abraham represents the source of faith — the part of the self that sets the foundation for assumption. He embodies the understanding that <em data-end="360" data-start="304">“whatever you assume to be true becomes your reality.”</em> In the story, Abraham directs the process with clear intention, ensuring the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">mind binds itself to what is aligned and lawful.</a></p><p>Psychologically, this shows that <strong>conscious assumption must not unite with just any emotional state</strong>. It must be joined to one that is lawful, stable, and harmonious with the originating faith. Abraham initiates that process — not Isaac — because <strong>faith precedes the union of thought and feeling</strong>.</p><p>This reflects the meaning of Genesis 2:24:<br/>
<em>"A man shall leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh."</em></p><p>Leaving father and mother symbolises releasing old emotional patterns and inherited beliefs. <a href="genesis-224-love.html">Cleaving is the deliberate uniting of consciousness to a new inner condition</a> — one that is life-giving and sustaining.</p><hr/><h3>The Servant as Disciplined Imagination</h3><p>The servant — traditionally named Eliezer, meaning <em>“God is help”</em> — represents the obedient and discerning use of <strong>imagination</strong>. He is not aimless; he moves under instruction, guided by signs of alignment and readiness. His prayer for a specific response — and his willingness to wait for it — reveals a deeply <strong>disciplined and receptive imagination</strong>.</p><p>This servant is the part of us that knows <strong>not every emotional state is fit to carry assumption into form</strong>. He watches for qualities: generosity, calm action, willingness — all signs of an inner state that is fertile and able to support creation.</p><p>Manifestation, then, requires more than assumption. It demands <strong>discernment of the correct internal feeling</strong>, the inner environment that will receive and nurture the assumed desire.</p><hr/><h3>Rebekah as Receptive State of Feeling</h3><p>Rebekah’s name means <em>“to tie firmly” or “to bind” (<a href="the-donkey-tied-to-vine-neville.html">the choicest vine</a>)</em>. She represents the <strong>inner state of feeling</strong> that willingly joins with assumption. She is not just emotion — she is <strong>feeling with intention</strong>, deep receptivity, and quiet strength.</p><p>Rebekah is found at the well — the place of water, a symbol of <strong>life and consciousness</strong>. Her actions — drawing water not only for the servant but also for his camels — represent the generous, ready state of awareness that <strong>goes beyond what is required</strong>. She does not hesitate; she responds from fullness. This is the <strong>state of consciousness that is prepared to receive the seed of assumption</strong> and nourish it into form.</p><p>In this way, she is not just compatible with Isaac — she is <strong>of the same essence</strong>.</p><p>This is echoed in Genesis 2:23:<br/>
<em>"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh."</em></p><p>This is the <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">moment of internal recognition</a> — <strong>assumption and feeling are now aligned</strong>. The word has found its emotional counterpart. It is this internal resonance — not outer circumstance — that makes the union fruitful.</p><hr/><h3>Cleaving to the Chosen State</h3><p>Genesis 2:24 continues:<br/>
<em>"Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."</em></p><p>This is not simply a marital commandment — it is a metaphysical<strong> law</strong>. When Isaac receives Rebekah, he brings her into Sarah’s tent. Sarah, the prior mother-state (past belief), is now gone. Rebekah replaces her — not with grief, but with <strong>comfort</strong>. Isaac is restored, stabilized, and fulfilled. The new state becomes home.</p><p>To cleave in this context means to <strong>unite your awareness with the new feeling</strong>, to embody it without returning to the old self. It is the act of <strong>living from the end</strong>, of letting your entire self be defined by the new condition.</p><p>From this union, life flows.</p><hr/><h2>Conclusion: The Law of Inner Marriage</h2><p>The story of Isaac and Rebekah is not a tale of arranged marriage — it is a pattern for the <strong>marriage of imagination and feeling</strong>, of desire and inner conviction.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Abraham, the father of faith, initiates the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The servant, disciplined imagination, seeks a suitable state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rebekah, the feeling-response, reveals herself through readiness and action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isaac receives her and is comforted — manifestation is complete.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Abraham's choice in Rebekah is intentional. She is the <strong>intended state of feeling</strong>, chosen by the law of faith. Genesis 2:23–24 reveals that this process is one of recognition and commitment: the soul must bind itself to a new inner reality and cleave to it without returning to the past.</p><p>In Neville’s language, this is the moment when <strong>you become one with the thing hoped for</strong>, when <strong>you no longer desire — you are</strong>. The union is not between people, but between states of being. And it is through that union that the promise becomes flesh, visible and fulfilled.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
