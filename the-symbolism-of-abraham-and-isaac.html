<h1>Abraham: The Sacrifice of Isaac </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p></p><p>In <strong>Genesis 22:1–19</strong>, the biblical story of Abraham preparing to sacrifice Isaac carries significance when viewed through Neville Goddard’s teachings on the Law of Assumption. In his lecture <em>“The Mystery Called Christ,”</em> Neville presents this narrative as a vivid metaphor for faith, surrender, and the power of imagination.</p><h3>Abraham: The Embodiment of Unwavering Faith</h3><p>Abraham symbolises the inner self that remains faithful to <a href="abraham-promise-and-covenant.html">God's promise</a>, regardless of what appears in the external world. Isaac, his beloved son, represents the visible manifestation—something deeply cherished yet still a product of that faith. The story is not about a literal sacrifice, but a deeper spiritual test: Abraham’s willingness to surrender his attachment to the visible, no matter how precious it may be.</p><h3 data-end="1191" data-start="1156">The Meaning of Abraham’s “I AM”</h3><p>
</p><p>In Genesis 22:1 NKJV, Abraham responds to God’s call with “<b><i><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">Here I AM</a></i></b>”, showing his full readiness to obey the divine command. Later, in Genesis 22:7 NKJV, Abraham says to Isaac, “<b><i><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">Here I AM</a>, my son</i></b>”, demonstrating the same presence and surrender toward the visible manifestation. This dual “<b><i><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">Here I AM</a></i></b>” reflects Abraham embodying the God sent “I AM” —fully aligned with both the invisible source and the manifested form. While the <a href="the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">double repetition echoes the law of identical harvest.</a></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">God’s Command to Sacrifice Isaac</h3><p>God commands Abraham to go to the land of Moriah which means '<i>the place of the Lord’s vision</i>” or “<i>the Lord has provided/seen</i>.”</p><blockquote>
<p>“Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and there offer him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.”<br>
— Genesis 22:2</p>
</blockquote><h3>The Test: Surrendering Attachment to the Visible</h3><p>The command to sacrifice Isaac is the ultimate test of faith and surrender. It challenges <a href="scrolls/label-abraham-series.html" class="noTag">Abraham</a> to release attachment to the external form of our desires and to trust instead the unseen creative power of imagination.</p><p>This act of surrender also echoes the symbolic meaning found earlier in <strong>Genesis 2:24</strong>, where “<b><i>a man shall leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife</i></b>.” Psychologically, this illustrates the inner movement required to shift states of being: one must leave behind attachment to the current, visible reality—in this case symbolised by his beloved son Isaac — in order to<a href="genesis-224-love.html"> cleave to the unseen source that brought it forth</a> — imagination. Abraham is not asked to reject the promise, but to demonstrate that his faith rests in imagination, and not in familiar and external attachments in. To truly "cleave" to the new state, the visible must be held lightly.</p><p>Neville teaches that true power lies not in clinging to what is seen, but in <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">maintaining unwavering assumption of the fulfilled desire</a> regardless of external circumstances. This surrender reveals absolute faith in the invisible reality—the creative force that brought Isaac into being.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and there was a ram caught by his horns in a bush.”<br>
— Genesis 22:13</p>
</blockquote><h3>The Ram: Divine Provision Beyond Expectation</h3><p>God’s provision of the ram in place of Isaac symbolises the unexpected blessings that arise when faith and surrender are complete. The ram reminds us that letting go of attachment to a specific outcome opens the door to divine provision—manifestations that may surpass our original vision.</p><h3>What This Means</h3><p>Neville’s interpretation shows that faith is about holding steady in trust and surrender to the unseen creative power behind all things. It is this inner faith, combined with letting go of attachment to appearances—even in adverse conditions—that allows the promise to be fulfilled in ways beyond our expectations.</p><blockquote>
<p>“True faith is demonstrated not by clinging to the visible, but by trusting the unseen creative power that brings it forth.”<br>
— Inspired by Neville Goddard</p></blockquote><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-abraham-series.html" class="noTag">Abraham Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-genesis-2-24-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 2:24 Series</a></p>
