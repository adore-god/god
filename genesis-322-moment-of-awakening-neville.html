<h1>Genesis 3:22 – The Moment of Awakening: Neville Goddard’s Interpretation</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"And the Lord God said, Truly, the man has become like one of us, having knowledge of good and evil; and now he might put out his hand and take of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever."</strong> — <em>Genesis 3:22 (BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Viewed through the lens of Neville Goddard’s <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, this verse becomes a <strong>psychological statement about how reality is formed</strong>, not a story about disobedience and punishment. The <a href="eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">Garden of Eden is an interior landscape</a> of states of consciousness — the terrain in which <strong>our assumptions take shape and produce experience</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>Two Trees, Two Inner States</strong></h2>

<p>In the Garden, there are <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">two symbolic trees: the <strong>Tree of Life</strong> and the <strong>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</strong></a>. These are not physical plants, but <strong>patterns of inner belief</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Tree of Life</strong> represents the core of the Law of Assumption — to <strong>assume as true what you desire</strong> and to live from that inner assumption. Eating from this tree means identifying with your desired state and feeling it as real now.</li>
<li><strong>The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</strong> represents a divided mind — judging by appearances (good/bad, success/failure) rather than living from inner assumption. This state fragments experience and blocks creative manifestation.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Eating” a tree in Genesis language simply means <strong>accepting an idea as true and living from it</strong> — not intellectually, but in the felt, emotional conviction of your imagination.</p>

<h2><strong>“Like One of Us” — The Plural Nature of Imagination in the Text</strong></h2>

<p>In Genesis 3:22, God observes that man has become <em>“like one of us”</em>. This is not about multiple gods, but a statement about the <a href="elohim-god.html"><strong>plural nature of imagination</strong></a> — the multiple states of consciousness within which reality is formed. <a class="noTag" href="genesis-126-man.html">The plural “us” echoes Genesis 1:26, where God says, <em>“Let us make man in our image, after our likeness”</em></a>, showing that man is a manifestation of the same creative, multifaceted imagination that is God — consciousness forming itself into experience.</p>

<p>From a psychological perspective, this observation shows that man has entered the <strong>realm of assumption</strong>: a state in which inner beliefs and feelings determine outward experience. The text highlights that man is now observed in the inner landscape where states of consciousness operate — the same terrain that, in Neville Goddard’s teaching, becomes the arena for assuming the reality one desires.</p>

<p>The verse does not describe an ability being granted; it records a <strong>milestone of perception</strong>: God sees that man now exists in the sphere where inner states shape experience. The “like one of us” phrase points to the <a href="elohim-god.html"><strong>recognition of the creative, plural nature of imagination</strong> within which man is placed.</a></p>

<h2><strong>Knowledge of Good and Evil — A Shift in Inner Orientation</strong></h2>

<p>“Knowledge of good and evil” is not moral guilt, but <strong>dualistic judgment</strong> — seeing life through opposing categories that separate and divide. Once the mind operates this way, it loses the simplicity of assuming the reality it desires. The Tree of Knowledge symbolizes a mind that reacts to external contrast instead of living from the inner feeling of “I AM.”</p>

<h2><strong>The Tree of Life — The Law of Assumption in Action</strong></h2>

<p>The concern about man possibly reaching for the <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of Life</a> and living “for ever” is about timing: <strong>creative power cannot be consciously exercised while the mind is ruled by appearances</strong>. Eternal life, psychologically, is the state of believing and feeling that what you desire is already true. Reality then conforms to that inner state. Neville’s teaching is clear: <strong>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong> and let that inner state shape your experience.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion: Genesis 3:22 as Law of Assumption</strong></h2>

<p>Genesis 3:22 is not about restriction or divine retribution, but about <strong>how inner states determine outward experience</strong>. The observation that man has become “like one of us” records that man has entered the realm where consciousness operates through assumption. The <a href="the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of Life</a> represents the Law of Assumption itself: <a href="genesis-111-seed.html"><strong>the inner fact precedes the outer manifestation</strong></a>. God’s statement marks a milestone — a recognition of the creative, plural nature of imagination that now shapes experience.</p>
