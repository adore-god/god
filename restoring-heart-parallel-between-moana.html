<h1>Restoring the Heart: A Parallel Between Moana and the Story of Ruth and Boaz</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>At first glance, <em>Moana</em>, a Disney animation about a Polynesian heroine returning a glowing green stone, and the biblical story of Ruth and Boaz might seem worlds apart. But when viewed symbolically, both narratives reveal a deep psychological truth: <strong>the journey from loss and barrenness to wholeness and creative power</strong>. Through the teachings of Neville Goddard and symbolic interpretation, we can see how both stories dramatise the return to the self, the restoration of <strong>the heart</strong>, the <strong>"<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>".</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Stolen Heart and the Lost "I AM"</strong></h3>
<p>In <em>Moana</em>, the stone is known as <strong>the Heart of Te Fiti</strong>—a powerful symbol of creation, life, and balance. When it is stolen, Te Fiti transforms into Te Kā, a destructive lava monster. This shift symbolises what happens when the creative heart of the self—the awareness of <strong>I AM</strong>—is forgotten, rejected, or misused. Life turns barren, hostile, and seemingly cursed.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the Book of Ruth, <strong><a href="ruths-loyalty-and-naomis-rebirth.html">Naomi’s widowhood</a></strong> represents a conscious identity that has lost its connection to creative power. Her name means <em>pleasant</em>, but she renames herself <em>Mara</em>—<em>bitter</em>. Like Te Fiti, Naomi is <strong>cut off from her heart</strong>—from the husband, the assumption, the creative “I AM” within. Her inner state reflects this loss: emptiness, grief, and perceived separation from the source of life.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Ruth and Moana: The Subconscious Movement Toward Restoration</strong></h3>
<p>In both stories, a <strong>faithful feminine figure</strong> emerges as the agent of restoration.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ruth</strong>, symbolising the <strong>subconscious imagination</strong>, stays loyal to Naomi even in barrenness. She journeys with Naomi back to Bethlehem (the “house of bread”) in search of sustenance, wholeness, and redemption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>, driven by a call deeper than logic, sets sail across the ocean—a classic symbol of the subconscious—to restore the heart and <strong>heal the land</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Ruth and Moana are figures of <strong>devotion, courage, and inner alignment</strong>. They do not act based on outer conditions—there is nothing to suggest success—but rather on an <strong>inner knowing</strong>. This reflects Neville Goddard’s principle: <em>imagination, when aligned with feeling, will always bring forth that which is assumed to be true.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Redeemer State: Boaz and Te Fiti</strong></h3>
<p>In Ruth’s story, the moment of restoration comes through her union with <strong>Boaz</strong>, a figure who symbolises the redeemer—the masculine assumption that completes and activates the creative process. Ruth and Boaz, when joined, produce <strong>Obed</strong>, a child symbolising <strong>manifestation</strong>, the fruit of inner union between imagination (Ruth) and assumption (Boaz).</p>
<p>Likewise, <strong>Moana returns the Heart to Te Fiti</strong>, but the twist is vital: <strong>Te Kā is Te Fiti</strong>. The destructive force was never separate—it was the <em>distorted form of the same being</em> whose heart had been removed. When Moana says, <em>“I know who you are,”</em> she is recognising the <strong>true identity</strong> beneath the chaos. This is identical to Naomi’s journey—once bitter and barren, she receives Obed into her lap and reclaims her name. She symbolically returns to <strong>Eden</strong>, a name that also means <em>pleasure</em>, reuniting with her creative self.</p>
<p>The moment the heart is returned, <strong>Te Fiti blossoms again</strong>, just as Naomi’s story blossoms into lineage—Obed, Jesse, David.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Symbolism of the Heart and the Womb</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Heart of Te Fiti</strong> is not just a plot device—it is the <em>seed of life</em>, the <em>womb of creation</em>. Its spiral engraving symbolises the eternal cycle of death and rebirth, inward movement, and outpouring. When it is held, protected, and restored, it brings abundance.</p>
<p>In Ruth’s story, <strong>the womb is also symbolic</strong>—Naomi, having lost her sons, sees no future. But through Ruth’s faith and alignment, a new child is born—not to Naomi directly, but through her inner extension. When she takes Obed into her lap, it is the <strong>conscious mind embracing the result of imagination</strong>.</p>
<p>Moana too, carries the heart across the sea like a child. She protects it, guards it, and finally restores it. It is an act of inner reconciliation and <strong>faithful persistence</strong>, just as Ruth clings to Naomi and steps into the unknown.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Return to Eden</strong></h3>
<p>Naomi’s transformation from <em>Mara</em> back to <em>Naomi</em> marks a <strong>return to Eden</strong>—the inner place of joy, fulfilment, and creative power. <em>Eden</em>, like <em>Naomi</em>, means <strong>pleasure</strong>. It is not a physical location but a <strong>state of consciousness</strong>—a mind realigned with imagination and assumption. Te Fiti’s restoration is this same symbolic return: from the scorched, outer-driven Te Kā to the lush, inner-centred Te Fiti.</p>
<p>Both stories tell us that the <strong>heart must be restored</strong>, the assumption must be remembered, and the subconscious must remain faithful even when the conscious mind has turned bitter.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Restoring the Inner Heart</strong></h3>
<p>Whether it is a Moabite woman gathering in a field or a Polynesian voyager crossing the ocean, the message is the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have not lost your power—only misplaced your heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ruth cleaves to the promise of life. Moana returns the stolen heart. Both are stories of <strong>remembering who you truly are</strong>.<br>
Both speak to a divine process within:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Recognise your barrenness</strong> (Naomi, Te Kā)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remain faithful through imagination</strong> (Ruth, Moana)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restore the heart—your assumption, your "I AM"</strong> (Boaz, Te Fiti)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receive the fruit—your manifestation</strong> (Obed, the restored land)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are both the one who lost the heart and the one who must return it. And when you do—when your assumption and imagination are reunited—you will take your desire into your lap, like Naomi with Obed, and know that what once seemed bitter was always blooming.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-film-reflections.html" class="noTag">Film Reflections</a> | <a href="label-ruth-series.html" class="noTag">Ruth Series</a></p>
