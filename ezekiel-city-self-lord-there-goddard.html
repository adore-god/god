<h1>The City of Self: The Lord Is There — A Symbolic Unveiling of Ezekiel 48:30–35</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The closing verses of Ezekiel’s prophetic vision depict the perimeter and gates of a holy city — a vision often misread as <a href="scrolls/label-architecture-series.html" class="noTag">architectural</a> prophecy, but far richer in symbolic content when approached with inner eyes open. The final line is particularly striking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“And the name of the city from that time on shall be, The Lord is there.”</strong> (Ezekiel 48:35, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is <strong>not a record of outer history</strong>, but a psychological drama occurring in the <strong><a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> of the individual</strong>. When we read Ezekiel’s blueprint with this awareness — and apply the symbolic meanings of the <strong><a href="the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew letters and numbers</a></strong> as outlined by S.L. MacGregor Mathers — we begin to see Ezekiel’s city not as a map of geography, but as a <strong>portrait of the awakened inner man</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The City of the Self: Gates of Consciousness</strong></h2>
<p>Ezekiel 48:30–34 describes <a href="scrolls/label-numbers--twelve.html" class="noTag">twelve</a> gates, each named for a <a href="/search/label/Twelve%20Tribes">tribe</a> of Israel. In psychological symbolism, the twelve tribes represent <strong>twelve faculties of the mind</strong> — or as Neville put it, "twelve disciplined aspects of consciousness." These gates are not physical openings but <strong>states of awareness</strong>.</p>
<p>Each direction of the city — north, east, south, and west — has <strong>three gates</strong>. The number three in Hebrew is ג (<em>Gimel</em>), which Mathers relates to <strong>movement</strong> and <strong>recompense</strong> — a camel bearing burdens. Symbolically, each side of the city is a <strong>trinity</strong> of faculties in motion, completing the circle of awareness on all sides of life: intellect, emotion, sensation, and intuition.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Measures and the Number 18</strong></h2>
<p>Ezekiel 48:35 gives a very specific measurement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is to be eighteen thousand all round: and the name of the city from that day will be, The Lord is there.” (BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number <strong>18</strong> is significant in <a href="the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew mysticism</a>. It is the numerical value of the word <strong>חי (<em>Chai</em>)</strong>, meaning <strong>life</strong>. This is formed by the letters <strong>Chet (ח)</strong> = 8, and <strong>Yod (י)</strong> = 10.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chet (ח)</strong> is the symbol of an <strong>enclosure, a doorway of life</strong> — consciousness entering form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Yod (י)</strong> is the <strong>creative spark of divine power</strong> — the seed of imagination itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, they suggest that the city Ezekiel sees is the <strong>city of life</strong>, made alive by the power of imagination — the spark of <strong>Yod</strong> within the enclosed form of human consciousness.</p>
<p>To “walk around” a city of 18,000 (18 × 1,000) is to <strong>fully encompass the realm of living awareness</strong> — 1,000 symbolising <strong>completion, fullness, or Divine expression in the natural world</strong>. Thus, the city has become <strong>fully alive with the awareness of God</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Name of the City: יְהוָה שָׁמָּה – YHWH Shammah</strong></h2>
<p>This is the true climax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The name of the city from that day will be, <em>YHWH Shammah</em> – The Lord is There.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To say “<a href="/search/label/Names%20of%20God%20Series">The Lord is There</a>” is to declare the <strong>assumption of divine presence in the now</strong>. Neville would interpret this as the state in which the individual no longer looks for God outside himself, but <strong>recognises "<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>" as the only <a href="the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The tetragrammaton <strong>YHWH (יהוה)</strong> contains four Hebrew letters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Yod (י)</strong> – creative spark, the seed of a desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He (ה)</strong> – the receptive aspect of consciousness (like a womb).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vav (ו)</strong> – a nail or connector, the joining of inner and outer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He (ה)</strong> again – manifestation or birth into form.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This sequence reflects the creative act Neville called <strong>Assumption</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Yod</strong> – You begin with a desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He</strong> – You receive it in imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vav</strong> – You persist in the assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He</strong> – It externalises in your world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“<strong>Shammah</strong>” (שָׁמָּה) means “there,” but also implies <strong>a fixed place</strong> — an <strong>abiding awareness</strong>. This is not about God being “in” a location. It is a declaration that <strong>the individual has entered the state of being</strong> in which the creative power <a href="the-nails-and-name-crucifixion-yhvh-and.html">(YHWH)</a> is recognised as <strong>ever-present, active, and embodied</strong> in the now.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Living in the City: The Fulfilled Assumption</strong></h2>
<p>When the prophet says the city <em>shall be called YHWH Shammah</em>, he is describing a <strong>permanent shift in identity</strong>. No longer does the seeker look outward for God or wait for future deliverance. He dwells <strong>within the fulfilled assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Neville taught:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and continue feeling it until that which you feel becomes manifest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To live in the city is to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I am what I have long sought.”</strong><br>
<strong>“The Lord is there — here — as me.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: The Final Gate</strong></h2>
<p>Ezekiel’s final vision is not the end of a book; it is the <strong>beginning of awakened living</strong>. The twelve gates, the measurements, the name — all point inward. They describe a <strong>transfigured state of mind</strong>, where the faculties of man have been harmonised, the creative power is recognised within, and life itself becomes a holy city.</p>
<p><strong>YHWH Shammah</strong> is not a place you travel to.<br>
It is a <strong>condition you awaken into</strong>.<br>
It is the state of being in which the <strong>Lord — your own wonderful I AM — is there.</strong></p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-architecture-series.html" class="noTag">Architecture Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-ezekiel-series.html" class="noTag">Ezekiel Series</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-numbers--twelve.html" class="noTag">Numbers: Twelve</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-spiritual-geography.html" class="noTag">Spiritual Geography</a> | <a href="scrolls/label-yhvh-series.html" class="noTag">YHVH Series</a></p>
