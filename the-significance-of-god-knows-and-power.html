<h1>God Knows: Repetition and the Law of Identical Harvest </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<blockquote><p><em>“It is not good for me to be proud, but I will come to visions and special experiences of the Lord.<br>
I have knowledge of a <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> in <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a>, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I do not know; or whether out of the body, I do not know: <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> knows), such a one was caught up to the third heaven.<br>
And I know such a <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I do not know: <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a> knows), that he was caught up into paradise, and heard words that may not be spoken, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.”</em><br>
— 2 Corinthians 12:1–3 (BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>In 2 Corinthians 12:1–10, Paul recounts an extraordinary spiritual experience—being caught up to the third heaven, receiving divine revelations, and hearing unutterable truths. Alongside this awe-inspiring vision, he reflects on his personal struggle: a persistent “thorn in the flesh.”</p><p>Amid this profound passage, two small words are repeated—<strong>“God knows.”</strong> These words, seemingly a simple aside, carry deep significance when viewed through Neville Goddard’s teachings. They are not mere punctuation but powerful affirmations.</p><h2>Why “God Knows” Appears Twice</h2><p>Paul deliberately repeats the phrase “God knows”:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Once in reference to the nature of the vision,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And again regarding whether it occurred in or out of the body.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <a href="the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">This repetition</a> is more than literary style—it is symbolic of <strong>confirmation</strong>. Neville Goddard emphasised that <strong>repetition is a key law of the imagination</strong>. When you persistently assume something to be true, you impress that assumption upon the subconscious, which then manifests it in the world.
</p>

<p>
    By saying “God knows” twice, Paul is not expressing uncertainty. He is <strong>fixing the reality of his vision</strong> within the divine consciousness. This repeated affirmation impresses the truth upon his inner being, anchoring it firmly as an unshakeable reality.
</p>

<h2>The Law of Identical Harvest: Fixed by God, Repeated in Creation</h2>

<p>
    This <a href="the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">principle of repetition as a seal of certainty</a> appears throughout the Bible. In Genesis 41:32 (BBE), Joseph interprets Pharaoh’s repeated dream:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p><em>“And the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is fixed by God, and God will quickly make it come about.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Repetition here signals that the event is <strong>established and inevitable</strong>.</p><p>But this divine pattern begins much earlier. In the creation story itself, <strong>Genesis mentions the creation of man twice</strong>, first in Genesis 1:27 and again in Genesis 2:7:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Genesis 1:27</em>: “So God created man in his own image…”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Genesis 2:7</em>: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground…”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At first glance, this might seem redundant. But symbolically, it reveals <strong>the law of identical harvest</strong>: the invisible seed planted in imagination (Genesis 1) must be followed by an identical outward manifestation (Genesis 2). There can be no harvest unlike the seed.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, the first mention represents <strong>the imaginal creation</strong>, the seed of the idea planted in consciousness. The second is <strong>the physical embodiment</strong>, the harvest that must come forth exactly as the seed.</p><p>This law—that creation is mentioned twice, reinforcing the fixed nature of what must come to pass—is the foundation of all manifestation:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Paul’s “God knows… God knows” fixes the reality of his spiritual vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pharaoh’s double dream confirms an unchangeable future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dual creation of man in Genesis shows that what is formed in the invisible must manifest in the visible.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>This is the law of identical harvest: what is impressed in imagination must appear in the outer world, exactly after its kind.</strong></p><h2>Repetition and the Subconscious in Neville’s Teachings</h2><p>Neville Goddard taught that <strong>repetition is the secret of real prayer</strong>. The subconscious mind does not discriminate between fact and fiction; it simply manifests what is impressed upon it through feeling and assumption.</p><p>Paul’s repeated phrase “God knows” acts as a subconscious impressing of certainty, whether he fully grasped the process or not. Joseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s repeated dream confirms that once something is fixed in the divine imagination, it cannot fail.</p><p>Manifestation is simply the external echo of an inner fixation.</p><h2>Repetition as a Tool for Manifestation</h2><p>When you affirm something repeatedly—with feeling and conviction—you are planting seeds in your subconscious mind. The law of identical harvest guarantees that these seeds will bear fruit.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Paul’s “God knows” is an inner declaration of faith made real in consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pharaoh’s double dream is a divine decree repeated and thus confirmed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genesis’ dual creation of man represents the principle that what is imagined will inevitably appear.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For us, the lesson is clear:</p><p><strong>Persistently assume your wish fulfilled. Repeat it with conviction. Allow your subconscious to accept it as reality. Then watch the outer world align accordingly.</strong></p><h2>Conclusion: The Divine Echo of Certainty</h2><p>The repetition of “God knows” in 2 Corinthians and the double dreams in Genesis illustrate a profound truth: <strong>repetition fixes reality in imagination</strong>. Once fixed, the law of identical harvest brings forth the corresponding manifestation.</p><p>This is not about God hearing your words. It is about <strong>you knowing your state is done</strong>. As Neville said, what is impressed on the subconscious must be expressed.</p><p>So when doubt creeps in, remember Paul and Joseph. Repeat your inner knowing. Fix your desire in consciousness. Because when it is repeated, it is fixed. And when it is fixed, it <strong>must</strong> come to pass.</p><p>Because <strong>God knows.</strong></p>

twice have I heard this:
that power belongs to God,
and that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love.
For you will render to a man
according to his work." — Psalm 62:11
