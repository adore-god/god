<h1>John Overview: Praise and Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>The <b><a href="genesis-224-love.html">Gospel of John is a love song</a></b> — an exaltation. In Neville Goddard’s language, John functions as the <strong><a href="scrolls/label-praise-series.html" class="noTag">embodiment of praise</a></strong> — not petition, not preparation, but the <strong>state of already having</strong>.</p>
<p>It opens with no <a href="scrolls/label-names-and-genealogies-series.html" class="noTag">genealogy</a>, no buildup — just the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">eternal identity</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the beginning was the <a href="scrolls/label-word-of-god-series.html" class="noTag">Word</a>, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”<br>
— John 1:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the start of a story — this is <strong>the voice of assumption</strong>. John teaches you to begin <strong>from the end</strong>. Not from asking, but from knowing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He who sees me sees him who sent me.”<br>
— John 12:45</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This level of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> — seeing yourself as already sent, already known, already divine — is the root of <strong>praise in the Law of Assumption</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Fourfold Pattern: Why John Is Praise</strong></h3>
<p>To understand John fully, we can align it with the ancient <strong>fourfold symbolism</strong> found throughout Scripture:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Matthew = Abraham</a></strong> (faith and origin)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Mark = Jacob</a></strong> (wrestling and immediacy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Luke = Joseph</a></strong> (imagination, dreams, and salvation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">John = Judah</a></strong> (praise and divine kingship)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Judah, whose name means <em>praise</em>, was the fourth son of Jacob. From his tribe came kings — including David and ultimately Jesus. In the same way, <strong>John’s Gospel is the kingly Gospel</strong>, the one that stands above the others in tone — not because it is better, but because it <strong>rests in dominion</strong>.</p>
<p>Judah’s descendants were <strong>meant to go first</strong> into battle (Judges 1:2), just as <strong>praise goes first</strong> in the Law of Assumption. You praise <em>before</em> the evidence. You assume from the end.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Praise as the Fragrance of Fulfilment</strong></h3>
<p>In John, we don't see <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> asking. We see Him <strong>thanking</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I give praise to you for hearing me. I am certain that you at all times give ear to me.”<br>
— John 11:41–42</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is before <a href="jesus-wept-for-easter-sunday.html">Lazarus</a> comes forth. There’s no tension, no pleading. This is <strong>fulfilled prayer</strong> — the natural expression of having assumed. Neville called this the <strong>Sabbath state</strong> — the restful knowing that <em>it is finished</em>.</p>
<p>Likewise, before feeding the 5,000:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Then Jesus took the loaves; and having given praise, he gave them out to those who were seated; and in the same way the fishes, as much as they had need of.”<br>
— John 6:11</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="the-breaking-of-bread-melchizedek-last.html">loaves</a> multiply <strong>after praise</strong>, not before. Praise is the key that unlocks appearance — because it <strong>assumes the reality behind it has already arrived</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The First Sign: Water into Wine</strong></h3>
<p>The first miracle in John is not healing or deliverance — it’s <strong>transformation into joy</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Jesus said to them, ‘Put water in the pots.’ And they put them full to the top. Then he said to them, ‘Now take some, and give it to the master of the feast.’”<br>
— John 2:7–8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus doesn’t ask God to act. He simply instructs. He assumes. And His comment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My time is still to come.”<br>
— John 2:4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the Law of Assumption in motion: <strong>time is irrelevant to fulfillment</strong>. What matters is inner alignment — and the wine appears.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>John and the Language of Unity</strong></h3>
<p>John constantly reveals that Jesus doesn’t operate as <em>apart</em> from God — but <strong>as one with</strong> God. This is what makes the Law of Assumption work: you do not try to become, you <strong>recognize that you are</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I and the Father are one.” — John 10:30 </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>
“At that time you will be certain that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.” — John 14:20 </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>
“Make them one, even as we are one.” — John 17:22</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <strong>identity language</strong>. For Neville, this oneness is not dogma but practice. To assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled is to <strong>rest in union</strong> with the Father — the I AM.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Miracles as States, Not Events</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike the Synoptic Gospels, John doesn’t portray Jesus as someone hoping to perform miracles. He simply speaks from authority. The man at the pool had waited 38 years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Get up, take your bed and go.”<br>
— John 5:8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus doesn’t wait for a sign. He gives a command <strong>from the end</strong>. This is the voice of praise. Not wishing for healing — <em>being the healed state speaking</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Comforter: Praise as Inner Knowing</strong></h3>
<p>John is the only Gospel that names the <strong>Comforter</strong> — the Spirit of Truth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Spirit of Truth, who comes from the Father, he will give witness about me.”<br>
— John 15:26</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Neville, this Comforter is <strong>your imagination</strong>, your inner teacher. The one that reminds you what’s already been assumed, already yours. Praise is not just a feeling — it’s <strong>your inner witness</strong> agreeing with God.</p>
<p>The Comforter doesn’t show you new laws — it reminds you of what you’ve already been told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He will be your teacher in all things, and will put into your memory everything I have said to you.”<br>
— John 14:26</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Power of "I AM"</strong></h3>
<p>Perhaps the most direct bridge between John and the Law of Assumption is the repetition of <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">"I AM"</a></strong> statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I AM the bread of life…” (John 6:35)<br>
“I AM the light of the world…” (John 8:12)<br>
“I AM the good shepherd…” (John 10:11)<br>
“Before Abraham came into being, I AM.” (John 8:58)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are not metaphors. They are declarations of state. Neville taught that<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html"> <strong>"I AM" is the name of God</strong></a> — your own awareness of being. When you say “I am healthy,” and feel it as true, you have entered the state. And praise is its fragrance.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: John as the Gospel of Praise</strong></h3>
<p>If Matthew lays the foundation, Mark ignites the will, and Luke guides the dreamer, <strong>John sings</strong>. It doesn't tell you how to become — it <strong>reminds you what you are</strong>.</p>
<p>In John, Jesus doesn’t perform — He <strong>reveals</strong>. He doesn’t plead — He <strong>thanks</strong>. He doesn’t wait — He <strong>assumes</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if anyone takes this bread for food he will have life forever.”<br>
— John 6:51</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To feed on the Word is to live in the end. To give thanks before you see. To praise not because you're trying to change, but because you <em>know it's done</em>.</p>
<p>That is the Gospel of John.<br>
That is Judah.<br>
That is praise.<br>
That is the Law of Assumption fulfilled.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
