<h1>Scarlet Threads: The Symbol of Assumed Identity in the Bible</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Through the Law of Assumption, Neville Goddard's Revelation of the Bible teaches that what you <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">accept as true—regardless of appearances—manifests in your world</a>. Scarlet, appearing in key Bible stories, represents this principle. Scarlet marks a <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">deliberate assumption</a>, a chosen identity that brings a new reality.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Scarlet: The Imaginative Force in Action</h2>
<p>Imagination is the only creative power. When you imagine—whether in love or fear, faith or doubt—you are assuming. Scarlet shows that your imagination is active, not a symbol of guilt or shame. Scarlet and blood represent life, power, and the flow of energy given to assumptions, just as blood gives warmth and life to the body.</p>


<hr>
<h2>Levitical Purification Rituals</h2>
<p>In Leviticus 14, the priest uses scarlet wool in purification rituals. This represents imagining yourself as pure and whole, even if current reality looks different. Repeated assumption “dyes” your consciousness with your chosen reality.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Isaiah 1:18</h2>
<blockquote>“Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow…” (Isaiah 1:18)</blockquote>
<p><a href="genesis-47-sin.html">“Sin” here means imagining negatively or from fear, not moral failure</a>. Scarlet represents imagination repeated until it shapes consciousness. Transformation comes from reimagining yourself correctly.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Song of Solomon 4:3</h2>
<blockquote>“Your lips are like a thread of scarlet…” (Song of Solomon 4:3)</blockquote>
<p>Lips show speech and inner assumption. The red thread represents consciously spoken assumptions.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Neville Connection:</strong> Dare to assume that you are what you want to be, and reality will conform to your assumption.</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>The Birth of Perez</h2>
<blockquote>Perez pushes past his twin, though Zerah was marked first with a scarlet thread. (Genesis 38:28–30)</blockquote>
<p>This shows that expected outcomes can be overtaken by strong assumptions. True manifestation depends on persistent belief, not appearances.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Neville Connection:</strong> Persist in your assumption even if visible signs suggest otherwise.</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Rahab’s Scarlet Cord</h2>
<blockquote>Rahab hung a scarlet cord from her window to protect her family. (Joshua 2:18, 6:25)</blockquote>
<p>The cord was an outward sign of inner belief. <a href="the-scarlet-thread-symbolism-and.html">Rahab</a> acted in faith, showing her assumption active in the <a href="god-wind-and-window-symbolism.html">window of the reader's imagination</a>.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Neville Connection:</strong> The scarlet cord shows the power of acting on your assumption; faith aligns your inner reality with the outer world.</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Scarlet as Symbol of Chosen Identity</h2>
<p>Scarlet often appears in priestly garments, temple veils, and sacrifices. Spiritually, it can represent:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A fixed assumption:</strong> A claim deliberately impressed on consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>Visibility of belief:</strong> Marks alignment with the divine pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Power in speech:</strong> Spoken words, like the scarlet lips, are creative acts.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Frank Carter’s Account of Neville’s Death</h2>
<p>In a series of lectures given after Neville’s passing, his friend and driver Frank Carter described the scene of Neville’s death in stark terms — noting that those present, including the coroner, observed a great deal of blood. This account circulates in audio and transcript form among students of Neville and is the origin of the specific detail. Whether taken as literal reporting or as part of the vivid oral testimony of a close friend, the image is best read in the Bible’s symbolic language: blood stands for life, movement and the energising power of imagination. If Neville “left blood everywhere,” Carter was, in symbolic speech, saying that Neville left imagination alive and flowing in many — his revelation continued to move and give life to others after his passing.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Closing Thought</h2>
<p>Scarlet threads mark who is chosen, who breaks through, and who is saved. You wear your assumptions like garments. Dare to assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled, and you clothe yourself in your chosen reality.</p>
