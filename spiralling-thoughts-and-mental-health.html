<h1>Spiralling Thoughts and Mental Health: Ezekiel’s Wheels, and the Power of Persistent Imagination</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>Modern psychology often talks about <strong>“spiralling thoughts”</strong>—when our minds get caught in a <a href="cain-lamech-and-jesus-psychology-of.html">repetitive loop of worry, fear, or doubt</a>, cycling deeper and deeper into negativity. While spiralling is often seen as a problem, it actually reveals a  truth about the nature of consciousness and manifestation—one the Bible hinted at long ago.</p><h2>Ezekiel’s Vision: Wheels Within Wheels as the Movement of Consciousness</h2><p>In Ezekiel 1, the prophet sees a vision of <strong><a href="wheels-within-wheels-symbolism-of-inner.html">wheels within wheels</a></strong>, complex and interlocking, full of eyes, capable of moving in any direction without turning. This symbolises the multidimensional nature of divine consciousness: always in motion, interconnected, and aware.</p><p>These <a href="wheels-within-wheels-symbolism-of-inner.html">wheels represent the dynamic flow of <strong>thought, feeling, and awareness</strong></a> within us—the very processes that shape our experience of reality.</p><h2>Spiralling Thoughts: The Psychological Reflection of Ezekiel’s Wheels</h2><p>The modern experience of spiralling thoughts mirrors Ezekiel’s vision. Our mind’s thoughts and feelings don’t move in straight lines—they circle, overlap, and deepen, just like the wheels moving in perfect synchrony. And if those thoughts are negative they spiral downwards</p><p>When we repeatedly dwell on a particular thought or feeling, spiralling occurs. This shows the mind’s natural tendency to <strong>reinforce and expand whatever it focuses on</strong>, for better or worse.</p><h2>The Biblical Law of Attraction: “As a Man Thinketh”</h2><p>The Bible teaches that whatever occupies the heart and mind persistently is what we attract into our lives. Proverbs 23:7 says, <em>“As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”</em> Neville Goddard echoed this in his law of assumption, emphasising that <strong>feeling the wish fulfilled</strong>, held steadily in the imagination, is what creates reality.</p><p>Spiralling thoughts—though often negative—are simply an example of this law at work. Dwelling on a problem or fear doesn’t just create a mental loop; it actively <strong>draws more of that reality into being</strong>.</p><h2>Consciousness as the “Eyes” on the Wheels: Awareness is Freedom</h2><p>Ezekiel’s wheels were “full of eyes,” symbolising awareness that can observe and direct the flow of thought and feeling. Likewise, becoming aware of spiralling thoughts allows us to <strong>step back and change direction</strong>.</p><p>Neville taught that when we consciously imagine and <strong>feel the wish fulfilled</strong>, we harness the power of these inner wheels to manifest desired outcomes rather than unwanted cycles.</p><hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The ancient vision of Ezekiel’s wheels within wheels is a beautiful allegory for the complex, spiralling nature of our thoughts and feelings. The Bible’s teaching and Neville Goddard’s law remind us that <strong>what we focus on grows</strong>—whether in spirals of worry or spirals of joyful fulfilment.</p><p>By becoming the aware “eyes” that guide our mental wheels, we can transform spiralling thoughts from traps into engines of creation.</p>
