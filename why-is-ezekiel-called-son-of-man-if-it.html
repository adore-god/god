<h1>Why Is Ezekiel Called 'Son of Man' If It Is a Title for Jesus?</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>The Book of Ezekiel is filled with divine encounters, prophetic visions, and one repeated phrase:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.”</em> — <em>Ezekiel 2:1</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The title <em>Son of Man</em> appears over <strong>ninety times</strong> in Ezekiel. And yet, in the New Testament, Jesus repeatedly refers to <em>Himself</em> as the Son of Man. For many, this feels contradictory—how could both Ezekiel and Jesus hold the same title?</p><p>But according to <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, this is not a contradiction at all. It is the <em>clue</em> to something far deeper:<br>
<strong>The Bible is not a history book. It is the spiritual autobiography of every individual.</strong></p><hr><h2><strong>From Genesis to Revelation: The Evolution of the Jesus State</strong></h2><p>Neville teaches that the Bible is one continuous narrative—the progressive revelation of <strong>God in man</strong>, culminating in the awakening of the state called <em>Jesus</em>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Genesis</strong>, we begin in unconscious perfection—a garden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then comes the descent into duality, the fall, the rise of names, nations, and prophets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are not external events, but symbols of the <em>stages of awareness</em> each of us must move through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Adam to Noah, to Abraham, Moses, David, and finally to <strong>Jesus</strong>, the state of <strong>perfect unity with God</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>“Jesus Christ is your own wonderful human imagination.”</em> — <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>So when Ezekiel is called <em>Son of Man</em>, he is not being given a name that belongs only to someone else—he is stepping into a higher state in the same unfolding pattern.</p><hr><h2><strong>Who Is the Son of Man?</strong></h2><p>In Neville’s terms, the <em>Son of Man</em> is the <strong>awakened awareness of being</strong>. It is that stage in your spiritual evolution when you no longer look to the outside world for authority—you begin to listen to the voice within.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The Son of Man is not a man born 2,000 years ago, but the awakened imagination in every man.”</em> — <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Ezekiel being addressed as <em>Son of Man</em> is symbolic. It marks him as a person entering into a new state:<br>
<strong>one who can now receive divine instruction directly.</strong><br>
He must eat the scroll—internalise the Word—just as Jesus later says, <em>“I and my Father are one.”</em></p><hr><h2><strong>Why Not Call Him ‘Son of God’?</strong></h2><p>Neville draws an important distinction:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Son of God</strong> = The eternal I AM. The divine spark. The original identity we all share before conditioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Son of Man</strong> = The <em>process</em> of that divine spark awakening within human consciousness.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The <em>Son of God</em> is your <strong>essence</strong>.<br>
The <em>Son of Man</em> is your <strong>realisation</strong> of it.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The Son of God is your awareness of being, but the Son of Man is that same awareness seen awakening within the world of form.”</em> — <em>Paraphrased from Neville</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Ezekiel is in the process of <em>becoming aware</em>. Jesus is that process fully awakened.</p><hr><h2><strong>Why Do People Think 'Son of Man' Refers Exclusively to Jesus?</strong></h2><p>This is a common assumption, and there are several reasons why the title became so strongly linked to Jesus in popular theology:</p><h2><strong>1. Jesus Frequently Uses the Title</strong></h2><p>In the Gospels, Jesus refers to Himself as <em>“Son of Man”</em> more than any other title. For instance:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.”</em> — <em>Luke 19:10</em><br>
<em>“The Son of Man must suffer many things…”</em> — <em>Mark 8:31</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Because of this consistent self-reference, early followers began to view the phrase as uniquely Messianic.</p><h2><strong>2. Daniel’s Vision Appears Prophetic</strong></h2><p>In Daniel 7:13, a mystical figure appears:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven…”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This “Son of Man” is given authority and dominion—making the link to Jesus seem inevitable in the minds of those reading forward into the Old Testament.</p><h2><strong>3. Later Theological Doctrine</strong></h2><p>Church tradition formalised the idea that <em>Son of Man</em> represented Jesus's humanity, while <em>Son of God</em> highlighted His divinity. This dual emphasis cemented the title as sacred and singular.</p><h2><strong>4. Literal Interpretations Miss the Symbolism</strong></h2><p>Because most interpret the Bible as linear history rather than psychological symbolism, they miss that <em>titles apply to states</em>, not to individuals alone. So when Ezekiel shares a title with Jesus, many assume it must be a reference <em>to</em> Jesus.</p><hr><h2><strong>Jesus: The Fulfilment of the Pattern</strong></h2><p>According to Neville, <em>Jesus is a state</em>—a level of consciousness available to all. He is not just a man in history but the <strong>pattern of complete realisation</strong>. Every story before Jesus in the Bible is a <strong>shadow</strong> or <strong>prototype</strong> of that ultimate state.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Jesus Christ is the personification of every man’s fulfilled desire.” — <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In that light, Ezekiel is a bridge between outer dependency and inner knowing. He is being called <em>Son of Man</em> because he is beginning to see:<br>
<strong>God speaks from within.</strong></p><hr><h2><strong>The Relevance to You</strong></h2><p>When God says to Ezekiel, <em>“Son of man, stand upon thy feet,”</em> He is saying the same to you.<br>
Awaken.<br>
Stand upright in your imagination.<br>
Claim your creative power.</p><p>You are not merely a product of the world—you are the author of your experience.</p><p>Every title in Scripture applies to you <em>when you enter the state it represents</em>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>You are Adam when you forget who you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are Moses when you lead yourself out of old belief systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are David when you face down the giant of circumstance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And you are Jesus when you fully awaken and say, <em>“Before Abraham was, I AM.”</em></p>
</li>
</ul><hr><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Title Is a Signpost</strong></h2><p>Ezekiel being called <em>Son of Man</em> is not an error or overlap—it is a <strong>signpost</strong> in the evolution of divine awareness.<br>
It tells us this:<br>
<strong>From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible describes your journey to realising yourself as God.</strong></p><p>And the state called <em>Jesus</em> is the <strong>fulfilment of that journey</strong>.</p><p><br></p>
