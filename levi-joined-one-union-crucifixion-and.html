<h1>Levi: The Joined One — Union, Crucifixion, and the Law of Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<blockquote><p><em>“After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. ‘Follow me,’ Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.”</em><br/>
— Luke 5:27 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brief but profound moment in the Gospel reveals much more than a simple calling of a disciple. Through the lens of Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption and biblical symbolism, Levi’s story unfolds as a symbolic narrative of transformation, union, and love.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Levi: The Meaning of ‘Joined’</h2>
<p>The name <strong>Levi</strong> literally means “joined” or “attached” in Hebrew. This joining is not superficial; it speaks to a deep spiritual and psychological union that is central to the process of manifestation.</p>
<p>Levi’s role as a tax collector—a man rooted in a fixed, worldly identity—makes his sudden call to “follow” Jesus all the more significant. It is the moment where the old self, attached to limitation and external validation, is invited to join fully to a new identity: one awakened by imagination and assumption.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Crucifixion as the Ultimate Joining</h2>
<p>Levi’s name evokes the imagery of the crucifixion—not merely as a historical event but as a symbolic act of <strong>total surrender and joining</strong>. In Neville’s teaching, the crucifixion represents the moment the old self is nailed to the assumption, a conscious assembly and kneeling before the new state of being.</p>
<p>This inner crucifixion is the act of letting go completely, joining oneself to the imagined reality so fully that no part of the old identity remains untransformed. Levi, “the joined one,” symbolises this surrender and the birth of a new consciousness.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Biblical Foundation of Love and Union</h2>
<p>The power of Levi’s name resonates deeply with the foundational verse from Genesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”</em><br/>
— Genesis 2:24</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word “cleave” here, akin to “join” or “attach,” reflects the profound union that forms the basis of transformation. Just as a man leaves behind his origins to join with his wife in intimate oneness, so too must consciousness leave behind old identities and assumptions to unite with the new self.</p>
<p>This union is not cold or mechanical but is the very essence of <strong>love</strong>—the creative force that binds and transforms.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Levi as a Symbol of Love Itself</h2>
<p>In Neville’s framework, love is the emotional foundation of assumption. It is the felt experience that cements the new state into being.</p>
<p>Levi’s “joining” is thus an act of love: a loving embrace of the new self and the surrender of the old. It is love that fuels the willingness to leave behind familiar limitations and to walk boldly into the unknown of one’s imagined reality.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Conclusion: The Inner Work of Manifestation</h2>
<p>Levi, the “joined one,” stands as a vivid symbol of the Law of Assumption in action:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The call to <strong>leave behind old identities</strong> (the tax booth)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moment of <strong>crucifixion and total surrender</strong> to the new state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>union of love and assumption</strong> that births new realities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you hear the call to “follow,” you are invited to become like Levi—to rise, leave behind the old, and join fully to the imagined self you desire to be.</p>
<p>This joining is the heart of manifestation: not a partial or hesitant step, but a <strong>whole and loving commitment to your assumed reality.</strong></p><div class="share-dropdown">
