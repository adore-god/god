<h1>"It Is Recorded of Me": The Inner Meaning of Psalm 40:7–8 </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<blockquote><p><strong>Psalm 40:7–8 (BBE):</strong><br/>
<em>"Then I said, See, I come; it is recorded of me in the roll of the book.<br/>
My delight is to do your pleasure, O my God; truly, your law is in my heart."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>There comes a moment when you realise the Bible is not speaking of external figures—it is speaking of <strong>you</strong>.</p><hr/><h2><strong>“Then I said, See, I come; it is recorded of me in the roll of the book.”</strong></h2><p>This is the voice of your true self—your <strong>I AM</strong>—awakening. It’s not coming from outside of you, but from within. It is the realisation that <strong>you are the one the Bible speaks of</strong>. The <em>“roll of the book”</em> is the story of <strong>consciousness</strong>, and in it, you are the central figure. This is the moment when you begin to recognise: <em>I am the Creator, and all the power of the universe resides within me.</em></p><hr/><h2><strong>“My delight is to do your pleasure, O my God; truly, your law is in my heart.”</strong></h2><p>To <em>“do God’s pleasure”</em> is not about external obedience—it’s about <strong>alignment</strong> with your true nature. Neville taught that <strong>imagination is God</strong>, and that when you consciously direct your imagination to fulfil your desires, you are in harmony with God’s will. This is not about struggling to conform to a set of rules, but about realising that <strong>the law of creation—God’s law—is within you</strong>. It is within your subconscious mind, waiting to be expressed.</p><p>And where is that law? <em>“In my heart.”</em><br/>
The heart here symbolises your <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, which governs your reality. It is the seat of your beliefs, assumptions, and feelings—the fertile ground where your imagination takes root and manifests in your external world.</p><hr/><h2><strong>You Are the One It’s Written About</strong></h2><p>Neville would say that the Bible is not an account of past events; it is a <strong>psychological drama</strong> about the <strong>inner awakening</strong> of the individual. <em>This Psalm</em> is a declaration of <strong>your awakening</strong>. <strong>You are the one it’s written about.</strong> <strong>You are the Word made flesh.</strong> And now, as you consciously align with your imagination, <strong>you come</strong> into the fullness of your creative power.</p><hr/><p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, this passage reflects a pivotal realisation: the Bible is not an external story—it is the <strong>story of consciousness</strong> unfolding within you. Each figure, each event, is a symbol of your inner journey. So, when you read these words, see <strong>yourself</strong> in them. <strong>You are the creator, and the entire Bible is your story</strong>.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
