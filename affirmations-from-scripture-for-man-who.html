<p><strong>I Am Strong and Purposeful</strong></p>
<p><em>Affirmations from Scripture for the Man Who Walks in His Power</em></p>
<p>This collection of Bible-based affirmations is for the man who knows his worth — the one who embraces his divine purpose and stands firm in his calling. Each verse, drawn from the Bible in Basic English (BBE), has been transformed into a first-person declaration of truth. These affirmations are not just words, but principles to live by. Speak them daily, and let them shape your mindset into one of confidence, strength, and clarity of purpose.</p>
