<blockquote><p><em>“Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab…”</em><br>
— <em>Matthew 1:5</em></p>
</blockquote><p>At first glance, this verse appears to offer nothing more than a genealogical detail. But through the interpretive key provided by Neville Goddard — that every name in Scripture represents a spiritual state or process — it reveals a rich inner pattern for the journey of manifestation.</p><hr><h2><strong>What Does the Name “Salmon” Symbolise?</strong></h2><p>The name <strong>Salmon</strong> (שַׂלְמוֹן) may derive from <em>shalom</em> — meaning <strong>peace, wholeness, or completion</strong> — but is also associated with the idea of a <strong>garment</strong> or <strong>covering</strong>.</p><p>In the language of consciousness:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If <em>shalom</em> is the root, <strong>Salmon is the inner peace</strong> and settled awareness that precedes manifestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a <strong>garment</strong>, he symbolises the <strong>assumption of a new identity</strong>, as Neville often describes — the donning of a new state of being.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Either way, Salmon is the <strong>inner act of consciousness that prepares the way</strong>. He is the soul coming into alignment — no longer tossed about by doubt or divided attention — but still, clothed, and prepared.</p><hr><h2><strong>Who Is Rahab?</strong></h2><p><strong>Rahab</strong> (רָחָב) comes from the Hebrew root <em>rachav</em>, meaning <strong>broad, wide, or spacious</strong>. Though she is introduced in Scripture as a harlot from Jericho, her symbolic function is far deeper.</p><p>She represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> in its state of redemption. Once aligned with outer conditioning, she is now <strong>redeemed and spacious</strong> — <strong>ready to receive</strong> the impress of a new assumption.</p><p>Her “spaciousness” is not laxity, but <strong>capacity</strong> — the ability to contain and nurture a new seed. In psychological terms, she is the subconscious made fertile through belief, cleared of the debris of former associations.</p><hr><h2><strong>Boaz: Fleetness Born of Union</strong></h2><p>The name <strong>Boaz</strong> (בֹּעַז) is traditionally translated as “strength,” but a more accurate root meaning is <strong>fleetness</strong> or <strong>swiftness</strong>. This subtle difference changes the symbolic dynamic.</p><p>Boaz is not just strong — he is <strong>ready and responsive</strong>. He represents the <strong>quickening of manifestation</strong>, the <strong>speed with which a spiritually fertilised subconscious (Rahab) responds</strong> when impregnated by the stabilised, assumed identity (Salmon).</p><p>Where Salmon is stillness and assumption, and Rahab is openness and capacity, <strong>Boaz is the living movement</strong> — the inner reality that takes form swiftly, borne on the wings of certainty and space.</p><hr><h2><strong>The Creative Sequence</strong></h2><p>This one verse — “Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab” — maps a profound spiritual sequence:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Salmon</strong> – the quiet, peaceful assumption; the garment of a new identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rahab</strong> – the subconscious made spacious, fertile, and receptive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Boaz</strong> – the swift movement of life into visible form</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It is a union that occurs <strong>within</strong>, not without. Salmon and Rahab are not merely people — they are <strong>processes of consciousness</strong>, converging in that moment of spiritual generation which Neville describes as the <strong>fusion of feeling with idea</strong>.</p><hr><h2><strong>Final Reflection</strong></h2><p>There is a reason Rahab is remembered in the lineage of Christ. She is not bypassed because of her past; she is honoured for what she became — <strong>a symbol of the subconscious transformed by truth</strong>. The soul, once wide to the world, becomes <strong>wide enough for God</strong>.</p><p>And from her comes Boaz — <strong>fleet manifestation</strong>, born of <strong>inner rest and receptive spaciousness</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p>Every swift result begins in peace.<br>
Every manifestation begins in the assumption of the desired state.<br>
And every soul becomes fruitful when made wide by truth.</p></blockquote><div class="share-dropdown">
