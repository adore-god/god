<h1>Sarah and Hannah Parallels According to Neville Goddard </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>

<p><strong>Before we begin, a reminder:</strong> the Bible is written in symbolism. Its men and women are not primarily about gender, but about how the mind works. <a href="genesis-126-man.html">“Man” represents the initiating awareness</a> — the <em>I AM</em> — and <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">“Woman” represents the responding, remembering, and receiving side of the mind</a>. What follows is an inner story.</p>

<p>Read this way, the stories of <strong><a href="sarahs-laughter-humour-of-manifestation.html">Sarah responding to Abraham</a></strong> and <strong><a href="el/hannah-favour-dedication.html">Hannah</a></strong> describe stages in learning and stabilising the Law of Assumption. They do not repeat one another — they progress. Sarah appears first in Scripture because she represents the <em>early discovery</em> of the law. Hannah comes later because she represents <em>devotion and consistency</em> within it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Genesis 2:23 — Woman as the Responding Mind</h2>

<p><a class="noTag" href="genesis-223-woman.html">Everything begins with <strong>Genesis 2:23</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is now bone of my bones<br>
and flesh of my flesh;<br>
she shall be called Woman,<br>
because she was taken out of Man.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not about origin in time but origin in function. Woman is drawn out of Man because she is the part of the mind that <strong>responds to <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">identity</a></strong>. She reflects, remembers, and agrees with what the <em>I AM</em> declares.</p>

<p>What Man assumes, Woman confirms. What Man believes himself to be, Woman carries forward as reality.</p>

<p>This is why Scripture repeatedly shows Woman conceiving according to belief, faith, or alignment — never effort.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Barrenness — When the Mind Has Not Yet Settled</h2>

<p>Barrenness in the Bible does not signify punishment or lack of worth. It describes a mental state.</p>

<p><a href="biblical-archetypes-of-feminine.html">To be barren symbolically is to desire without yet resting in assumption</a>. The remembering mind has not fully agreed with the <em>I AM</em>. Faith exists, but it is new, fragile, or interrupted by memory of limitation.</p>

<p>This is the condition both Sarah and Hannah begin in — but they resolve it differently and at different depths.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sarah — Discovering the Law Through Joy and Surprise</h2>

<p><strong>Sarah</strong> appears first in the biblical narrative because she represents the mind’s <strong>initial encounter</strong> with the Law of Assumption.</p>

<p><a href="sarahs-laughter-humour-of-manifestation.html">When Sarah laughs</a> in <strong>Genesis 18</strong>, her laughter is not mockery. It is surprise. It is the shock of realising that identity, not conditions, is creative.</p>

<p>This is the earliest stage of faith: <em>joyful disbelief giving way to possibility</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Is anything too hard for the Lord?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question is not about circumstance. It challenges the remembering mind directly. If the <em>I AM</em> accepts itself as the source, memory must follow.</p>

<p><a href="the-symbolism-of-abraham-and-isaac.html">Isaac — whose name means “laughter”</a> — is born from this <a href="the-law-timeline.html">stage</a>. He represents the first joyful proof that assumption works. Faith is real, but still young.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Hannah — Devotion and Undivided Agreement</h2>

<p><strong><a href="el/hannah-favour-dedication.html">Hannah</a></strong> comes later in Scripture because she represents a deeper stage: not discovery, but <strong>devotion</strong>.</p>

<p>Hannah’s distress is not ignorance of the law. It is the pain of inner division. She knows what she wants, yet the remembering mind is still pulled between faith and struggle.</p>

<p>Her prayer in <strong>1 Samuel 1</strong> is the turning point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not sacrifice — it is alignment. Hannah no longer negotiates with desire. <a href="el/hannah-favour-dedication.html">She dedicates the mind entirely to God</a>, meaning identity alone governs thought.</p>

<p>Here, the remembering mind stops arguing. Faith is no longer emotional effort; it becomes loyalty.</p>

<p>Immediately after this prayer, Hannah’s countenance changes. Peace appears before manifestation — because agreement has already been reached.</p>

<hr>

<h2>From Laughter to Loyalty</h2>

<p>Sarah and Hannah are not parallel stories; they are sequential.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sarah</strong> <a href="sarahs-laughter-humour-of-manifestation.html">represents learning the law</a> — the first joy, surprise, and faith that imagination creates.</li>
<li><strong>Hannah</strong> represents living the law — devotion, consistency, and undivided agreement with the <em>I AM</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Isaac is born from delight. Samuel is born from dedication.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What Is Born from Agreement</h2>

<p><strong>Isaac</strong> (“laughter”) shows that the law works.</p>
<p><strong>Samuel</strong> (“asked of God”) shows that the mind can remain faithful to it.</p>

<p>Neither child is a reward. Both are expressions — the natural result of the remembering mind agreeing with identity.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion — Woman as the Faithful Witness</h2>

<p>Woman, taken out of Man in Genesis 2:23, symbolises the remembering mind that bears witness to identity.</p>

<p>When she is barren, the mind is divided. When she rejoices, faith is being discovered. When she is devoted, assumption is stable.</p>

<p>Sarah teaches us the joy of realising imagination creates.</p>
<p>Hannah teaches us the peace of never arguing with it again.</p>

<p>When the mind is wholly dedicated to the <em>I AM</em>, conception is inevitable.</p>
