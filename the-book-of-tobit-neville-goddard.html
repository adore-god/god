<h1>The Book of Tobit: A Neville Goddard Perspective</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">

<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the Bible is not a historical record, but a spiritual drama, unfolding the inner journey of the human consciousness. Every character, every event, and every symbol represents aspects of our own mental and spiritual development. When we look at the <strong>Book of Tobit</strong> through Neville’s lens, we uncover a deep psychological and spiritual allegory about the restoration of inner vision and the power of divine guidance.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Book of Tobit: Not Included in All Christian Bibles</strong></h3><p>It’s important to note that the <strong>Book of Tobit</strong> is not included in the Hebrew Bible or in many Protestant Bibles. However, it is considered part of the <strong>Deuterocanonical books</strong> by the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, which regard these books as <strong>inspired scripture</strong>. For those who follow the Protestant tradition, Tobit is regarded as apocryphal, meaning it is not seen as divinely inspired.</p><p>Despite its exclusion from some canons, the Book of Tobit offers profound spiritual and psychological teachings that align with Neville Goddard’s interpretations of the Bible as a guide to personal transformation. It serves as a rich allegory, exploring themes of faith, divine guidance, and the restoration of spiritual sight. Whether or not it is part of your personal Bible canon, the deeper meanings and lessons of Tobit can resonate on a universal level.</p><hr><h3><strong>Tobit: The Loss of Inner Vision</strong></h3><p>The name <strong>Tobit</strong>, derived from the Hebrew word <em>"tov"</em>, meaning <strong>"good"</strong> or <strong>"goodness"</strong>, is a powerful reminder that, at the core of our being, we are always connected to divine goodness. This is significant when we consider that Tobit, though blind, continues to act with faith, charity, and integrity. Even though he loses his physical sight, his <strong>inner goodness</strong>—his faith and his connection to God—remains intact. In Neville Goddard’s framework, this <strong>goodness</strong> within represents the <strong>higher self</strong>, the divine nature that always persists, no matter the outward circumstances.</p><p>Despite his physical blindness, Tobit continues to pray and perform acts of kindness, such as giving alms. This reflects the <strong>faithful persistence of the higher self</strong>, which continues to seek goodness and maintain spiritual practices, even when we are temporarily "blind" to our creative powers.</p><blockquote>
<p>"For I am a servant of God, and I will praise him, and I will bless his name for ever and ever."<br>
(Tobit 13:1)</p>
</blockquote><p>This verse highlights Tobit’s unshakable faith, even in the face of his physical blindness. Despite his outer condition, he maintains a strong connection with his inner spiritual power. The name <strong>Tobit</strong>—meaning "God is good"—serves as a reminder that <strong>the divine goodness within us remains constant</strong>, even in moments when we may feel spiritually blind or disconnected.</p><hr><h3><strong>Tobias: The Soul’s Journey</strong></h3><p>The name <strong>Tobias</strong> (from the Hebrew <em>Toviyyah</em>) also carries deep symbolic meaning. Just as <strong>Tobit</strong> means "God is good," <strong>Tobias</strong> translates to "<strong>Yahweh is good</strong>" or "God is my good." This name emphasizes <strong>the divine goodness of God as a direct relationship with the individual</strong>. In the context of the story, <strong>Tobias represents the soul</strong> embarking on a transformative journey to reclaim spiritual and material wealth. His mission is symbolic of the <strong>soul’s return to its divine source</strong>—a journey of <strong>restoration and healing</strong>.</p><p>Tobias’ journey is guided by <strong>Raphael</strong>, the angel of healing. In Neville’s teachings, <strong>Raphael represents the higher consciousness</strong> or imagination—your intuitive guidance. Just as Tobias is guided by Raphael, so too are we led by our own divine intuition, which helps us navigate life’s challenges and return to spiritual wholeness.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid; peace be with you. Bless God for ever. As for me, I am Raphael, one of the seven angels who enter and serve before the glory of the Lord.'”<br>
(Tobit 12:17)</p>
</blockquote><p>Raphael’s role in the story is pivotal, symbolising the <strong>guiding force of divine intuition</strong> or inner wisdom. Neville would say that Raphael represents the <strong>imagination or inner guidance</strong>—always present to help us on our journey of transformation.</p><hr><h3><strong>Healing the Blindness: The Return of Vision</strong></h3><p>When Tobias returns home, he uses the <strong>gall of a fish</strong> (a curious and symbolic act) to restore his father’s sight. This is a powerful moment of spiritual renewal. The fish’s gall represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>—often filled with negative emotions or past traumas. By <strong>transforming this "bitterness" into healing</strong>, Tobias is not only restoring his father’s physical sight but symbolically representing the process of healing the inner vision, returning to the <strong>goodness</strong> of the higher self.</p><p>The <strong>name Tobias</strong>, meaning "<strong>Yahweh is good</strong>," underscores the theme of <strong>divine restoration</strong>. Tobias’ act of healing his father aligns with the notion that divine goodness is an active, transforming force. Just as Tobias brings physical healing to his father, so does the divine goodness within guide us toward healing—both spiritually and emotionally.</p><p>The act of healing through the fish’s gall suggests that <strong>true healing comes through confronting and transforming past pain or blockages</strong>—transforming negative energy into something beneficial. The bitterness of the fish’s gall represents the negative emotions or limiting beliefs we may carry within our subconscious. By confronting these elements and transmuting them, we allow room for healing and spiritual restoration.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Then Tobias said to his father: ‘Take courage, father, and I will bring you the medicine that will make you see again.’”<br>
(Tobit 11:8)</p>
</blockquote><p>This verse highlights the <strong>connection between faith, divine guidance, and manifestation</strong>. Just as Tobias follows Raphael’s instructions to heal his father, we must follow the guidance of our own inner wisdom, imagination, and faith to restore our own spiritual sight—seeing the world not with physical eyes, but through the eyes of the imagination.</p><hr><h3><strong>Neville’s Takeaway:</strong></h3><p>The Book of Tobit is a beautiful allegory for the journey of <strong>spiritual restoration</strong>. Here’s how Neville Goddard would likely interpret the key themes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tobit</strong> represents the higher self that has temporarily lost sight of its creative power, yet continues to maintain faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tobias</strong> is the soul on a mission to reclaim spiritual power and restore its connection with the divine. His name, meaning "Yahweh is good," reflects that the journey is always supported by divine goodness and guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sarah</strong> represents the subconscious mind, which is initially blocked by fear but capable of transformation through love and faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Raphael</strong> is your imagination or divine intuition, guiding you along the path of healing and self-realisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>journey</strong> is the process of manifestation—healing the inner world so the outer world can reflect it.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr><h3><strong>The Final Insight:</strong></h3><p>As Neville often said, <strong>you walk through life thinking you are alone, but your angel—your imagination—walks with you, guiding you towards your highest good</strong>. When you allow your imagination to be your guide, and when you trust in your divine intuition, you begin to see clearly again—just as Tobit’s sight is restored. This is the power of living by imagination, of trusting in the unseen, and allowing divine ideas to manifest in your life.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Is anything too hard for the Lord?” (Genesis 18:14) — a reminder that there is nothing too difficult for the power of imagination.</p>
</blockquote><p>The <strong>name Tobias</strong>, meaning "<strong>Yahweh is good</strong>," reinforces this theme of divine goodness being an active force that drives healing, restoration, and transformation. Just as Tobias returns home to restore his father’s sight, we are always capable of restoring our inner vision through the goodness of God within us.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p class="label-links"><a href="scrolls/label-healing-series.html" class="noTag">Healing Series</a></p>
