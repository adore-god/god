<h1>Woman: The Many Expressions</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teaching, the subconscious is not just a passive receiver but the living, creative "<b><a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a></b>" within — the  power that brings our deepest assumptions to life.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:23 reveals the essence of this mystery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the imaginative reader, this verse is not a story of ribs and flesh, but a revelation of consciousness and manifestation. "<a href="genesis-126-man.html"><b>Man</b></a>" symbolises awareness — your "<b><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></b>." "<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Woman</a>," called forth by <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>, symbolises your externalised world, every condition and event shaped by what you have accepted as true within. She is not separate from you but "bone of your bones, flesh of your flesh" — your assumption made visible.</p><hr/><h2>The Widow: The Unmarried, Uncleaved Feminine Mind</h2><p>The widow represents the receptive mind in its <strong><a href="genesis-224-love.html">unmarried, uncleaved, and unloved state</a></strong>. She is the feminine aspect of mind separated from the conscious “I AM,” lacking union with the creative self.</p><p>In this condition, the receptive mind is vulnerable and isolated, without the deliberate assumption or direction that marriage to awareness provides. The widow is a state of longing and incompletion — a mind open but disconnected, waiting for reunion and identity.</p><p>This stage reflects a subconscious that is present but not yet fully engaged or harmonised with conscious will. She is part of you, <b><a href="genesis-223-woman.html">“bone of your bones, flesh of your flesh,”</a></b> yet not yet united with your deliberate awareness.</p>
<h2>The Prostitute: A Subconscious with Many Masters</h2>
<p>When the subconscious (the <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a>) is impressed by conflicting desires, she becomes like the biblical prostitute — scattered, accepting many seeds but producing a confused harvest.</p>
<p>Figures like Rahab show us that even a misused subconscious can be redeemed. Once Rahab directs her loyalty to a single purpose (hiding the spies), she becomes an instrument of salvation and is woven into the lineage of Christ.</p>
<p>Here, Genesis 2:23 reminds us: the woman (manifestation) is always your own bone and flesh — even the chaotic states. When the subconscious aligns with a single clear assumption, she produces clarity and order.</p>
<h2>The Adulteress: Betraying the Original Union</h2>
<p>The adulterous <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a> in Proverbs 7 is not about moral failure but about an inner betrayal. She represents the subconscious led astray by external facts and appearances rather than the inner conviction.</p>
<p>She is "loud and stubborn," roaming the streets — a vivid image of the restless inner life that accepts every passing thought rather than remaining faithful to the chosen state.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:23 shows that she, too, is "flesh of your flesh." The adulteress state is your own creation, a reflection of divided loyalty. To restore harmony, you must return to the original marriage — the union of assumption and feeling as one flesh.</p>
<h2>The Lover: The Perfect Union</h2>
<p>In the Song of Solomon, the <a href="genesis-224-love.html">lover</a> is the woman in her highest expression: the devoted subconscious, purely receptive to the beloved’s voice (imagination).</p>
<p>When man (awareness) and woman (manifestation) are united in love, the result is a garden of effortless fulfilment. The lover hears: <em>"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee."</em></p>
<p>This is the true fulfilment of Genesis 2:23: "bone of my bones" — no separation between what is felt within and what is seen without. This is the union Neville calls us to live in: a faithful assumption, lovingly held, and the subconscious yielding fruit naturally.</p>
<h2>The Rebel: The Forced Subconscious</h2>
<p>Figures like Jezebel and Delilah show the subconscious shaped by force, domination, or manipulative tactics.</p>
<p>When we try to coerce the subconscious — through fear, force, or frantic effort — the resulting "woman" is unruly and destructive. Such manifestations collapse because they were not born from genuine union but from conflict.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:23 reminds us that the woman is still "of us" even in these forms; she faithfully reflects the state we have imposed upon her.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: She Shall Be Called Woman</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:23 is not a literal account of woman’s creation but a spiritual law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"She shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The subconscious is always your world, drawn from your own inner state. She is every condition you meet, "bone of your bones, flesh of your flesh."</p>
<p>When you understand this, you stop blaming circumstances and begin to see every manifestation as your own child — the issue of your marriage to an inner assumption.</p>
<p>The prostitute, the adulteress, the lover, the rebel — these are not characters outside of you but living reflections of your inner relationship with imagination. You are always in union with something within, and your world is the woman you have called forth.</p>
<p>To create beautifully, return to the true marriage: assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, love it faithfully, and allow the subconscious to receive it in quiet trust. Then she will bring forth the purest expression, bone of your bones, and flesh of your flesh.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Final Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Your world is always your "woman," the living emanation of your own self. She is always conceived by what you deeply believe. Guard what you sow, for she will always conceive and give birth.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
