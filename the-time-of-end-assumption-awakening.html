<h1>The Time of the End:  Daniel 12</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>Consider:</p><p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“But you, go on your way till the end: for you will have rest, and will be in your place at the end of the days.”</em> — Daniel 12:13</blockquote><p></p>
<p>This closing statement in Daniel is not a vague prophecy of death or some distant reward—it is the summation of the mystical journey of consciousness. From a Neville Goddard perspective, it speaks directly to the Law of Assumption: <a href="peace-and-rest-in-song-of-solomon.html">rest in your assumed state</a>, and in time, you shall rise into the reality of it. Every “end of days” is the end of a cycle of imagination, where that which was persistently felt and assumed becomes externalised.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through <strong>Daniel chapter 12</strong>, unlocking its symbolism in line with Neville’s teaching: that imagination is God and assumption is the creative act.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Daniel 12:1 – The Time of Trouble and Awakening</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And at that time Michael will take his place, the great angel who is the defender of your people: and there will be a time of trouble, such as there never was from the time of the nation’s birth till that time: and at that time your people will be kept safe, everyone who is recorded in the book.”</em> (Daniel 12:1, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> symbolises the assertion of a higher state—a mighty angel, or messenger, arising in the imagination. According to Neville, <strong>angels are personifications of ideas or states of consciousness</strong>. Michael standing up represents the moment when the dominant assumption within the self shifts—when the individual no longer succumbs to fear or circumstance but asserts a new identity.</p>
<p>The <strong>“time of trouble”</strong> is the internal conflict one feels when attempting to move from an old self-concept to a new one. It is the disturbance within when you declare "I am" something which outward facts do not support. But it is precisely in that trouble that the old self begins to dissolve.</p>
<p>Those who are “<strong>recorded in the book</strong>” are those who have written a new story within—those who have impressed upon the subconscious a clear image of their desired end.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Daniel 12:2 – The Dual Awakening</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And a number of those who are sleeping in the dust of the earth will come awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and a bitter fate.”</em> (Daniel 12:2, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the <strong>awakening of the sleepers</strong> is not about literal resurrection. In Neville’s terms, it is about <strong>states</strong>. Those "in the dust" are dormant potentials or identities buried in the subconscious. When these awaken, they manifest: either into joy (when aligned with love, faith, and the ideal self) or into misery (when fuelled by fear, guilt, or limitation).</p>
<p>This mirrors the Law of Assumption: that which we assume to be true of ourselves will rise into form. Assumptions lead to embodiment—whether uplifting or damning, depending on their nature.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Daniel 12:3 – The Brightness of the Wise</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And those who are wise will be shining like the light of the sky; and those who have guided numbers into righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.”</em> (Daniel 12:3, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be “<strong>wise</strong>” here is to know and use the Law. The wise are those who have discovered the creative power of imagination and govern their world accordingly. They shine because they’ve moved into conscious authorship of their reality.</p>
<p>Those who “<strong>guide into righteousness</strong>” are not preaching morality—they are leading others into right thinking, right assumption, into the alignment with their ideal. Like stars, they become fixed examples of the spiritual law in action, illuminating others.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Daniel 12:4 – Seal the Book</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But as for you, Daniel, let the words be shut up, and the book covered till the time of the end: numbers will go to and fro, searching will be increased.”</em> (Daniel 12:4, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse symbolises the <strong>inner secret</strong> of creation—sealed from the outer man until he is ready to look within. The “book” is the subconscious mind, where all assumptions are recorded and later externalised.</p>
<p>The <strong>increase in searching</strong> is the modern hunger for truth—for deeper laws of reality. People run to and fro seeking meaning, and eventually come to realise that the kingdom of heaven is within, and imagination is the creative word.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Daniel 12:5–7 – The Two Others and the Man on the Waters</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Then I, Daniel, looking, saw two others, one at the edge of the river on this side, and one at the edge of the river on that side.”</em> (Daniel 12:5, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>two others</strong> may symbolise duality—past and future, conscious and subconscious, seen and unseen. The <strong>man on the waters</strong> represents the <strong>conscious observer</strong>, hovering over the flow of reality, the awareness that bridges the gap between inner assumption and outer manifestation.</p>
<p>When asked how long until the wonders come true, he raises both hands—this is <strong>a declaration of spiritual law</strong>: the miracle will not come by time but by assumption fixed with conviction.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Daniel 12:8–10 – The Sealed Mystery</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And I said, My lord, what is the sense of these things? And he said, Go on your way, Daniel: for the words are shut up and secret till the time of the end.”</em> (Daniel 12:8–9, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the denial of meaning but the <strong>reassurance that understanding comes with experience</strong>. The end spoken of is not a date but a personal <strong>awakening</strong>—the end of ignorance and the rise of knowing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“...the evil-doers will go on doing evil; and the wise will give thought to it.”</em> (Daniel 12:10, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville might say: the unawakened will keep reacting to appearances, while the wise will imagine and assume. The “purified” are those who have passed through the fire of disciplined inner work.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Daniel 12:11–12 – The Numbers and the Waiting</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And from the time when the regular burned offering is taken away, and the disgusting thing which makes desolation is put in place, there will be a thousand, two hundred and ninety days.”</em> (Daniel 12:11, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This “burned offering” is the <strong>old religious sacrifice</strong>—the act of trying to please an outer God. When it is removed, the <strong>“disgusting thing”</strong> is what replaces it: the belief in separation, materialism, doubt.</p>
<p>But those who wait patiently, symbolised by the <strong>blessing after 1,335 days</strong>, are those who persist in the unseen, holding their assumption despite appearances.</p>
<p>Neville taught that <strong>persistence in assumption</strong> leads to certainty in experience. The days are not about literal counting, but about sustaining the imaginal act until it is complete.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Daniel 12:13 – The Final Rest and Rising</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But you, go on your way till the end: for you will have rest, and will be in your place at the end of the days.”</em> (Daniel 12:13, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the echo of every spiritual truth: persist in the way—<strong>your imaginal way</strong>—until the end. Rest is the Sabbath, the psychological rest of knowing “It is done.” You have entered the state and can now relax, knowing the seed is planted.</p>
<p>At the “end of the days”—the end of the imaginal gestation—you will rise into the embodiment of your assumption. Not by effort, but by rest. Not by pleading, but by knowing.</p>
<p>This is <strong>Daniel’s message through Neville’s eyes</strong>: trust in the law. Assume the state. Rest in it. And you will stand in your place—your manifested world—when the cycle completes.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
