<h1>Misunderstanding God: External Vs Internal </h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>One common criticism of the Law or Assumption (law of manifestation) &mdash; especially from a Christian-influenced perspective &mdash; is that it &ldquo;<a href="genesis-126-man.html">makes man</a> like <a href="elohim-god.html">God</a>.&rdquo; (despite the text saying that from the very beginning) It's seen as arrogant or blasphemous for someone to claim they can create their own reality. And yet, this critique often stems not from what the Bible truly says, but from how it has been most commonly interpreted &mdash; particularly through the lens of separation.</p>
<h3>The External God Illusion</h3>
<p>Traditional Christianity tends to present God as an external being &mdash; a distant, authoritative figure who must be pleased, petitioned, or obeyed. From this framework, the idea that a human could shape reality by imagining or declaring something is immediately offensive.</p>
<p>But this entire structure rests on a misreading of the Bible&rsquo;s symbolic language. As Neville Goddard &mdash; and mystics before him &mdash; pointed out, the Bible is not a secular history book, but a psychological drama unfolding within each individual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God is not &ldquo;up there&rdquo; &mdash; God is &ldquo;I AM.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>John 10:33 &ndash; &ldquo;You Make Yourself God&rdquo;</h3>
<p>When Jesus says in John 10:30, <em>&ldquo;I and the Father are one,&rdquo;</em> the religious leaders react with outrage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; John 10:33</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This accusation is exactly the same as the one hurled at those who practice manifestation today: <em>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re God?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>But look at what Jesus replies, quoting Psalm 82:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Is it not written in your law, &lsquo;I said, ye are gods&rsquo;?&rdquo;</em> &mdash; John 10:34</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t correct them by saying, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not making myself God.&rdquo; Instead, he affirms that the scriptures themselves declare man as divine in nature. The problem isn&rsquo;t that Jesus claimed union with God &mdash; it&rsquo;s that the people couldn&rsquo;t accept their own potential.</p>
<h3>The Power Was Always Within</h3>
<p>From a manifestation point of view &mdash; whether taught by Neville Goddard, Florence Scovel Shinn, or even modern teachers &mdash; the core truth is that the creative power lies in imagination, and imagination is God-in-you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>&ldquo;The kingdom of God is within you.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Luke 17:21</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>&ldquo;Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus...&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Philippians 2:5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>&ldquo;As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Proverbs 23:7</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not just poetic suggestions. They are coded instructions for understanding the divine nature of consciousness.</p>
<h3>The Real Blasphemy</h3>
<p>If we&rsquo;re to take Jesus&rsquo; statement seriously &mdash; <em>&ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo;</em> &mdash; then to deny your own creative power is not humility, it&rsquo;s forgetfulness. The real blasphemy may be in rejecting the gift of imagination, in living as if you're powerless, when the Bible clearly speaks of divine identity and dominion.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: The Bible Confirms Manifestation &mdash; When Read Rightly</h3>
<p>The law of manifestation is not man &ldquo;playing God&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s man remembering that God plays through him.</p>
<p>John 10:33 doesn&rsquo;t expose blasphemy; it exposes fear. Fear of what happens when people awaken to the truth that God is not separate. That you are not a servant, but a vessel of divine creative power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;You are gods. And all of you are children of the Most High.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; Psalm 82:6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, yes &mdash; manifestation makes man &ldquo;like God.&rdquo; Not because it&rsquo;s wrong, but because it is written.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
