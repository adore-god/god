<h1>John: The True Light</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<blockquote><p>"The true light was that which gives light to every man coming into the world.</p><p>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world did not know him.</p><p>He came to that which was his own, and his own people did not take him to their hearts.</p><p>But as many as took him to their hearts, to them he gave the right to be the sons of God, to those who had faith in his name:</p><p>Who were not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God". —John 1:9-13</p></blockquote><p></p>
<p>In John 1:9-13, we are introduced to the idea of a "<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">true light" that enlightens every person coming into the world</a>. However, despite this divine presence, many fail to recognise it. This passage is not a religious story but an insightful metaphor for the power of imagination, as explained through Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>"The true light was that which gives light to every man coming into the world."</strong></blockquote><p></p>
<p>In Neville’s framework, the "true light" represents the awareness of imagination—the divine spark within us all. This inner light is not an external force but the very <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">creative power that resides in every individual</a>. When we realise this, we can begin to shape our reality, just as Neville teaches us that everything we experience <a href="genesis-111-seed.html">stems from our assumptions</a>.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>"He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world did not know him."</strong></blockquote><p></p>
<p>This verse highlights that the light—our imagination—exists in the world, yet the world fails to recognise its true source. Many are unaware of their own creative power, often attributing external circumstances or forces to the outcomes in their lives. According to Neville, the Law of Assumption shows that what we assume about ourselves and our world shapes our reality. The failure to recognise this inner power keeps many in the dark.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>"He came to that which was his own, and his own people did not take him to their hearts."</strong></blockquote><p></p>
<p>Here, we see a reflection of the struggle between the <a href="genesis-126-man.html">external self (the old man) and the inner self (the true creative power)</a>. Neville often spoke about how the individual must embrace their true identity as a creator, shedding old beliefs and assumptions. The "own" in this verse can be seen as the individual’s current state of consciousness, which often resists accepting the new, more empowered identity of a creator.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>"But as many as took him to their hearts, to them he gave the right to be the sons of God, to those who had faith in his name:"</strong></blockquote><p></p>
<p>To "<a href="genesis-224-love.html">take him to their hearts</a>" is to accept the power of your imagination and the assumption of the desired state. This verse aligns with Neville’s idea that by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you are granted the power to manifest it into your reality. It is not enough to simply believe; you must embody the assumption of the state you wish to manifest. By doing so, you activate the divine potential within you and step into your role as a "son of God"—a creator in your own right.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>"Who were not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."</strong></blockquote><p></p>
<p>This verse highlights that true <a href="http://genesis-111-seed.html">transformation comes from within</a>, through the <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assumption of a new identity</a>, and not through external circumstances. The "will of man" refers to the limited beliefs that come from the external world, while "the will of God" refers to the assumption of a higher state of being, aligned with the creative power within us. Neville’s teachings stress that manifestation is not about efforting or working from the outside in, but about assuming and embodying the new state from within - as <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> did.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>John 1:9-13 serves as a profound reminder of the transformative power within us. Through Neville Goddard's Law of Assumption, we understand that the "true light" represents the power of imagination, waiting to be recognised and embraced.</p>
