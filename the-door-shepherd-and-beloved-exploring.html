<p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible describes the inner workings of consciousness &mdash; a series of psychological dramas within the <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">mind of man</a>. Every name, every door, and every birth is symbolic of a shift taking place inside the <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">house of awareness</a>.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;house&rdquo; in scripture always points to the mind &mdash; the <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">inner dwelling of imagination where all states live</a>. Within this house are doors and rooms, latches and chambers &mdash; thresholds between one state of being and another. To move through a door is to enter a new identity.</p>
<p>At the centre of this house stands <strong>David &mdash; the beloved (be loved!) &mdash; the son formed within consciousness when love fixes itself upon an idea</strong>. He is not a man of history but a symbol of what happens when awareness &mdash; the reader&rsquo;s own &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; &mdash; gives itself to a chosen assumption and calls it real. This &ldquo;giving&rdquo; is what scripture calls the Father giving His only son: consciousness identifying so completely with its imaginal act that the assumption takes on life of its own.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Door Within the Head</h2>
<p><a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> said, &ldquo;I AM the door.&rdquo; Neville explained that this means <em>I AM</em> &mdash; awareness itself &mdash; is the only entrance to any experience. The door is psychological. It exists in the <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">head</a>, not in the world. To &ldquo;enter through&rdquo; it is to accept a new assumption as fact, to occupy a new room in the mind&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Every time you say, &ldquo;I AM this&rdquo; or &ldquo;I AM that,&rdquo; you open a door in consciousness. The shepherd in John 10 represents the directing power of imagination &mdash; the inner faculty that guides you through these doorways, leading the flock of potential states to pasture.</p>
<p>Thus, the shepherd and the door are one and the same. The shepherd moves the flock by imagination; the door opens through assumption. Together, they describe the movement of awareness within the head &mdash; the inner dwelling of God.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Latch of the Heart</h2>
<p>In the Song of Solomon, the beloved puts his hand through the latch of the door, and the heart of the maiden stirs. The latch represents the subconscious mechanism of consent. The door cannot be opened from without; it must be lifted from within.</p>
<p>The beloved does not force entry. He is the imagined self &mdash; the potential new state &mdash; standing at the threshold of your belief. Only when the latch of inner acceptance is lifted can the beloved enter and make his dwelling in you.</p>
<p>This describes the moment of conception within the <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">house</a>: when desire is no longer something longed for, but something allowed. The latch lifted is the heart saying &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<hr/>
<h2>David: Door&ndash;Nail&ndash;Door</h2>
<p>The name <strong>David (דָּוִד)</strong> is spelled <em>Daleth&ndash;Vav&ndash;Daleth</em> &mdash; door, nail, door. His name itself is a structure, a joining of two thresholds with a nail in between. <strong>Daleth</strong> (door) signifies a state or opening; <strong>Vav</strong> (nail) represents the act of fixing or joining.</p>
<p>David is therefore the <strong>fixed assumption</strong> &mdash; the beloved consciousness joined firmly between the inner and outer worlds. He stands as the connecting point between imagination (the inner door) and manifestation (the outer door). Jesus, as the son of David, is the symbolic crucifixion of that assumption &mdash; love fixed in imagination until it lives.</p>
<p>This is why David is called &ldquo;beloved.&rdquo; He is the son born when love has found its dwelling &mdash; when the reader&rsquo;s own awareness has given itself completely to the chosen image and abides in it.</p>
<p>When scripture says God &ldquo;gave His only son,&rdquo; it describes the process of assumption. Awareness gives itself to an idea until it becomes its reality. The &ldquo;son&rdquo; is that fixed identity &mdash; the beloved being nailed into consciousness, held there until it takes form. <a href="the-father-son-symbolism-in-bible.html">Father and Son symbolism is built on this premise throughout the narrative of the Bible</a>.</p>
<p>David, then, is not just a shepherd or king &mdash; he is the <strong>formed son</strong>, the fixed image of your own love made substantial. He represents the awareness that has passed through both doors and now abides as the beloved within the house of consciousness.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Sin at the Door</h2>
<p>In <strong>Genesis 4:7</strong>, it is said to Cain, &ldquo;Sin lies at the door, and you may rule over it.&rdquo; This is the Bible&rsquo;s first mention of sin &mdash; not as moral wrongdoing, but as <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">psychological misalignment</a>. The Hebrew <em>chatta&rsquo;th</em> means &ldquo;to miss the mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sin crouching at the door is the old self waiting for re-entry &mdash; the former assumption asking to be believed again. The <a href="el/house-head-bible-symbolism.html">house of the mind</a> has many rooms; some lead to peace, others to fear. But the doorknob is always on the inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may rule over it&rdquo; is the reminder that you are master of the house. You choose which door to open, which thought to let in. To &ldquo;rule over sin&rdquo; is simply to refuse re-entry to states that contradict your <a href="ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">desired assumption</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The House Made One</h2>
<p>Through these three passages &mdash; <strong>Genesis 4</strong>, <strong>Song of Solomon 5</strong>, and <strong>John 10</strong> &mdash; the Bible outlines the inner architecture of the mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>door</strong> in Genesis shows the threshold of choice.</li>
<li>The <strong>latch</strong> in Song of Solomon shows inner consent.</li>
<li>The <strong>door</strong> in John 10 shows conscious entry into a new state.</li>
</ul>
<p>David unites them all. His very name holds the pattern of passage: inner door &mdash; nail &mdash; outer door. He is the finished structure, the <strong>house of the Lord</strong> made whole.</p>
<p>In him, awareness finds expression. The &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; &mdash; the reader&rsquo;s own consciousness &mdash; gives itself to its chosen <a href="genesis-126-man.html">image</a>, and that image stands <a href="scrolls/label-crucifixion-series.html">crucified</a> within the head as living identity.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Inner Temple</h2>
<p>The head, in this allegory, is the true temple &mdash; the house in which all scripture unfolds. Every threshold is a state of being, every latch a belief. The shepherd, the beloved, and the son are all movements within the one mind of man.</p>
<p>David is the son in whom awareness is <a href="eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">well pleased</a>, for the inner and outer doors have become one. The state once imagined now lives. The Word has become flesh &mdash; consciousness has clothed itself in form.</p>
<p>This is the mystery of manifestation. The Father gives His only son &mdash; meaning, consciousness gives itself to its chosen assumption &mdash; and that assumption becomes visible. The giving is the act of assumption; the son is the formed identity; and the house is the head in which it all takes place.</p>
<p>When you assume the wish fulfilled, you are David &mdash; the beloved son through whom awareness expresses itself. You are the house of God, and every door within you leads to a new world.</p>
