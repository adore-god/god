<h1>Joseph of the New Testament: Accepting and Protecting a New Assumption</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In Neville Goddard’s symbolic reading, biblical characters are not historical figures but living symbols of states of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> and inner processes. <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph, an early teacher of the Law of Assumption in Genesis</a>, reappears in the New Testament as the husband of Mary in the New Testament, represents a stage in the journey of the law of Assumption— the rational mind encountering a new assumption already received and developing in the receptive mind.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Joseph as Imaginative Discipline</h2>
<p>Joseph is described as <a href="genesis-126-man.html">“a just man”</a> — remembering that <a href="elohim-god.html">God means 'judges' and 'rulers', it reinforces that he acts correctly and rightly</a> in relation to the assumptions that are forming. He represents the part of consciousness that wants order, follows rules, and responds to what is just according to inner law.</p>
<p>When Joseph discovers that Mary is with child before they have come together, he is surprised:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.” — Matthew 1:19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “quiet divorce” is a temporary hesitation. It represents Joseph stepping back from old habits, expectations, and reasoning — not a final rejection — so he can eventually align with the new assumption forming in Mary.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Mary: The Receptive Mind</h2>
<p><a href="genesis-223-woman.html">Mary represents Eve, now developed into a devoted mind</a> that listens continually to the judgments and directives of the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>. She receives assumptions directly and brings them into manifestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Her <a href="the-virgin-birth-of-love.html">virgin pregnancy represents a new state of being</a> created internally, without outer proof or inherited tradition.</li>
<li>Joseph’s initial hesitation (quiet divorce) reflects the rational mind resisting the new assumption because it does not yet fit with outer reasoning.</li>
<li>By eventually <a href="genesis-224-love.html">cleaving to Mary</a>, Joseph aligns with the new assumption and supports its full realisation in reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>This also reflects <a href="genesis-224-love.html">Genesis 2:24</a>:</p><blockquote> 
“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife.” </blockquote>
<p>Spiritually, the imaginative mind leaves old identity, habit, and reasoning, cleaving to the receptive mind where the new assumption has been planted.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Joseph: The Supplanter and the Planned Role</h2>
<p>The name Joseph means “supplanter.” His <a href="scrolls/label-joseph-series.html">repeated appearance</a> in the Bible shows he has a planned role: to bring forth a new assumption whenever it appears. <a href="teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Joseph's stories in Genesis</a> teach us how to maintain our assumptions through imagination, even in the face of conflict and opposition</p>
<ul>
<li>In Genesis, Joseph disciplines imagination to bring a new state into expression, in the same way that <a href="scrolls/label-joseph-series.html">he brought the opposing aspects of his mind together in his earlier stories</a>.</li>
<li>In the New Testament, Joseph recognises the new assumption forming in Mary and supports it rather than resisting.</li>
<li>Being “just” means he acts in alignment with the new assumption, not according to old reasoning.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>Joseph’s Transformation: Step by Step</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Surprised</strong> — encounters a new assumption without outer proof.</li>
<li><strong>Temporarily hesitant (quiet divorce)</strong> — clears old identity and expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Recognises the rightness of the new assumption</strong> — becomes “just” by supporting it.</li>
<li><strong>Supports and protects</strong> — ensures the assumption is fully expressed in reality.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h3>Key Point</h3>
<p>Joseph represents the imaginative mind learning to accept and carry a new assumption already planted in the receptive mind (Mary). Leaving the father and mother (Genesis 2:24) means detaching from old identity, habits, and reasoning. Alignment allows the assumption to manifest in the world. Resistance delays manifestation; acceptance brings it to completion. Joseph is both surprised and just — he recognises the new assumption as correct and protects it, allowing it to produce the intended result.</p>
<p> 
The birth of <a href="jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus symbolises the full realisation of a new assumption that saves</a>. It is the moment when the planted assumption has matured enough to establish itself in the mind, becoming a fixed reality that can be relied upon to produce consistent effects in life.
