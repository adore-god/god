<h1>Eyes of God: Single Eye</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In the Bible, the eye is more than a physical organ. It is a recurring symbol of perception and imagination. Through the teachings of Neville Goddard, we uncover the deeper meaning behind this symbol: the <strong>eye as imagination</strong>, and the <strong>eye as belief</strong>.</p><p>According to Neville, the true &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; is done not with the outer eye, but the <strong>inner <a href="genesis-126-man.html">eye of self-perception</a></strong>. This eye directs your world, for your life is shaped not by what you observe, but by what you accept inwardly as true.</p><hr/><h3><strong>&ldquo;If then your is eye true&hellip;&rdquo; &mdash; Matthew 6:22</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; <em>Matthew 6:22 KJV</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville taught that the &ldquo;single eye&rdquo; is not about physical sight, but about <strong>undivided attention</strong>. It is the power of focused imagination. When your eye is single, you are <strong>anchored in the end</strong>, refusing to entertain conflicting states.</p><p>A single eye means seeing only that which you desire&mdash;<strong>living from the wish fulfilled</strong>, even when the outer world suggests otherwise. This inward purity of vision floods the body (symbol of experience) with light&mdash;clarity, energy, and spiritual wholeness.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;To be single-eyed is to be incapable of seeing anything other than the state affirmed.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><hr/><h3><strong>The Eye as the Filter of Reality</strong></h3><p>In Neville&rsquo;s framework, the eye becomes a <strong>creative filter</strong>. What you look at with inner belief becomes your world. If your vision is clouded by doubt, resentment, or fear, these are mirrored back to you in outer experience.</p><p>But when you look with the eye of faith&mdash;<strong>seeing only what you choose to affirm</strong>&mdash;you enter into alignment with the creative power of imagination. This is not denial of the facts, but <strong>refusal to accept anything as final</strong> except that which you have decreed within.</p><hr/><h3><strong>To See with the Eye of Imagination</strong></h3><p>Neville often described imagination as <strong>&ldquo;seeing with the eye of God.&rdquo;</strong> This is the eye that looks not at appearances, but at possibilities. The inner eye sees differently&mdash;<strong>it sees what could be, not merely what is.</strong></p><p>While physical eyes may report lack or limitation, the eye of imagination claims abundance, beauty, and fulfilment.</p><p>This is the act of creation: to close the outer eyes and <strong>see with conviction</strong> the world as you desire it to be&mdash;until it must reflect that image back to you.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Ezekiel&rsquo;s Vision: Eyes and Wheels Within Wheels</strong> &mdash; <em>Ezekiel 10:12 (KJV)</em></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about...&rdquo;</em> &mdash; <em>Ezekiel 10:12, KJV</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The prophet Ezekiel describes a mystical vision: <strong>wheels within wheels</strong>, each <strong>&ldquo;full of eyes round about.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>To Neville, this image is not about strange machinery, but about <strong>conscious awareness in motion</strong>. The eyes symbolise infinite perception&mdash;<strong>divine intelligence that sees all</strong>. The wheels represent states or cycles of consciousness, turning in harmony with the eternal law.</p><p>This vision affirms that <strong>every aspect of your experience is being seen&mdash;consciously or unconsciously&mdash;and responded to</strong>. The &ldquo;many eyes&rdquo; show that nothing escapes the law of assumption. You are surrounded by the outpicturing of what you see inwardly and believe deeply.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Lift Up Your Eyes: A Shift in Consciousness</strong> &mdash; <em>Genesis 13:14 (KJV)</em></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:&rdquo;</em> &mdash; <em>Genesis 13:14, KJV</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Throughout Scripture, we are urged again and again to <strong>&ldquo;lift up your eyes.&rdquo;</strong> This simple phrase carries rich symbolic weight. It is a call to elevate one's attention&mdash;<strong>to rise above appearances and behold a higher reality</strong>.</p><p>When Abraham was told to lift up his eyes, it was so he could behold the land of promise&mdash;not physically, but inwardly. He was being asked to claim it by vision. In Neville&rsquo;s terms, this is the <strong>act of assuming the state desired</strong>, and dwelling in it as though it were already yours.</p><p>To lift the eyes is to reject the evidence of the senses and <strong>align with the unseen truth</strong>. It is the quiet, potent motion of imagination reaching upward into the realm of fulfilment.</p><hr/><h3><strong>Blindness in Scripture: The Unawakened Eye</strong> &mdash; <em>Mark 10:46&ndash;52 (KJV)</em></h3><p>Biblical stories of blindness, when read symbolically, show us the journey from unbelief to inner vision.</p><p>Take the story of <strong>Bartimaeus</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight...&rdquo;</em> &mdash; <em>Mark 10:52, KJV</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A blind beggar, Bartimaeus cries out to Jesus&mdash;not for charity, but for sight. In Neville&rsquo;s symbolic interpretation, Jesus represents the <strong>power of awakened imagination</strong>, and Bartimaeus is the soul yearning to see rightly.</p><p>To be blind is to be unaware of one&rsquo;s creative power. To gain sight is to <strong>recognise that your assumption creates your world</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Man is blind to what he does not believe.&rdquo;</em><br/>
&mdash; <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><hr/><h3><strong>Conclusion: You See What You Believe</strong></h3><p>The symbolism of the eye in Scripture, when viewed through Neville&rsquo;s teachings, reveals a profound spiritual law: <strong>you do not see with the eye; you see through it</strong>. Your assumptions, your imaginal acts, and your beliefs shape the very world you behold.</p><p>To train the inner eye&mdash;to make it single, unwavering, and full of light&mdash;is to awaken the divine creative power within.</p><p>Like Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision, the many eyes remind us that <strong>every part of the self is capable of perception</strong>, and every state we dwell in turns the wheels of experience.</p><p>And when Scripture bids you to &ldquo;lift up your eyes,&rdquo; it is not pointing you skyward, but inward&mdash;to the invisible realm where imagination rules and all things are possible.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
