<h1>Eyes of God: Single Eye</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In the Bible, the eye is more than a physical organ. It is a recurring symbol of perception and imagination. Through the teachings of Neville Goddard, we uncover the deeper meaning behind this symbol: the <strong>eye as imagination</strong>, and the <strong>eye as belief</strong>.</p><p>According to Neville, the true “seeing” is done not with the outer eye, but the <strong>inner <a href="genesis-126-man.html">eye of self-perception</a></strong>. This eye directs your world, for your life is shaped not by what you observe, but by what you accept inwardly as true.</p><hr/><h2><strong>“If then your is eye true…” — Matthew 6:22</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p><em>“The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.”</em> — <em>Matthew 6:22 KJV</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville taught that the “single eye” is not about physical sight, but about <strong>undivided attention</strong>. It is the power of focused imagination. When your eye is single, you are <strong>anchored in the end</strong>, refusing to entertain conflicting states.</p><p>A single eye means seeing only that which you desire—<strong>living from the wish fulfilled</strong>, even when the outer world suggests otherwise. This inward purity of vision floods the body (symbol of experience) with light—clarity, energy, and spiritual wholeness.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“To be single-eyed is to be incapable of seeing anything other than the state affirmed.”</em><br/>
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><hr/><h2><strong>The Eye as the Filter of Reality</strong></h2><p>In Neville’s framework, the eye becomes a <strong>creative filter</strong>. What you look at with inner belief becomes your world. If your vision is clouded by doubt, resentment, or fear, these are mirrored back to you in outer experience.</p><p>But when you look with the eye of faith—<strong>seeing only what you choose to affirm</strong>—you enter into alignment with the creative power of imagination. This is not denial of the facts, but <strong>refusal to accept anything as final</strong> except that which you have decreed within.</p><hr/><h2><strong>To See with the Eye of Imagination</strong></h2><p>Neville often described imagination as <strong>“seeing with the eye of God.”</strong> This is the eye that looks not at appearances, but at possibilities. The inner eye sees differently—<strong>it sees what could be, not merely what is.</strong></p><p>While physical eyes may report lack or limitation, the eye of imagination claims abundance, beauty, and fulfilment.</p><p>This is the act of creation: to close the outer eyes and <strong>see with conviction</strong> the world as you desire it to be—until it must reflect that image back to you.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Ezekiel’s Vision: Eyes and Wheels Within Wheels</strong> — <em>Ezekiel 10:12 (KJV)</em></h2><blockquote>
<p><em>“And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about...”</em> — <em>Ezekiel 10:12, KJV</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The prophet Ezekiel describes a mystical vision: <strong>wheels within wheels</strong>, each <strong>“full of eyes round about.”</strong></p><p>To Neville, this image is not about strange machinery, but about <strong>conscious awareness in motion</strong>. The eyes symbolise infinite perception—<strong>divine intelligence that sees all</strong>. The wheels represent states or cycles of consciousness, turning in harmony with the eternal law.</p><p>This vision affirms that <strong>every aspect of your experience is being seen—consciously or unconsciously—and responded to</strong>. The “many eyes” show that nothing escapes the law of assumption. You are surrounded by the outpicturing of what you see inwardly and believe deeply.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Lift Up Your Eyes: A Shift in Consciousness</strong> — <em>Genesis 13:14 (KJV)</em></h2><blockquote>
<p><em>“Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:”</em> — <em>Genesis 13:14, KJV</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Throughout Scripture, we are urged again and again to <strong>“lift up your eyes.”</strong> This simple phrase carries rich symbolic weight. It is a call to elevate one's attention—<strong>to rise above appearances and behold a higher reality</strong>.</p><p>When Abraham was told to lift up his eyes, it was so he could behold the land of promise—not physically, but inwardly. He was being asked to claim it by vision. In Neville’s terms, this is the <strong>act of assuming the state desired</strong>, and dwelling in it as though it were already yours.</p><p>To lift the eyes is to reject the evidence of the senses and <strong>align with the unseen truth</strong>. It is the quiet, potent motion of imagination reaching upward into the realm of fulfilment.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Blindness in Scripture: The Unawakened Eye</strong> — <em>Mark 10:46–52 (KJV)</em></h2><p>Biblical stories of blindness, when read symbolically, show us the journey from unbelief to inner vision.</p><p>Take the story of <strong>Bartimaeus</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight...”</em> — <em>Mark 10:52, KJV</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A blind beggar, Bartimaeus cries out to Jesus—not for charity, but for sight. In Neville’s symbolic interpretation, Jesus represents the <strong>power of awakened imagination</strong>, and Bartimaeus is the soul yearning to see rightly.</p><p>To be blind is to be unaware of one’s creative power. To gain sight is to <strong>recognise that your assumption creates your world</strong>.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Man is blind to what he does not believe.”</em><br/>
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><hr/><h2><strong>Conclusion: You See What You Believe</strong></h2><p>The symbolism of the eye in Scripture, when viewed through Neville’s teachings, reveals a profound spiritual law: <strong>you do not see with the eye; you see through it</strong>. Your assumptions, your imaginal acts, and your beliefs shape the very world you behold.</p><p>To train the inner eye—to make it single, unwavering, and full of light—is to awaken the divine creative power within.</p><p>Like Ezekiel’s vision, the many eyes remind us that <strong>every part of the self is capable of perception</strong>, and every state we dwell in turns the wheels of experience.</p><p>And when Scripture bids you to “lift up your eyes,” it is not pointing you skyward, but inward—to the invisible realm where imagination rules and all things are possible.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
