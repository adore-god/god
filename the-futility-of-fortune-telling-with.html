<h1>The Futility of Fortune-Telling with Tarot Cards: The Future Depends on Your State of Being</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content">
<p>In the traditional use of tarot cards, many people look to the future for guidance, relying on the images and symbols to tell them what’s ahead. However, from the perspective of the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, this type of fortune-telling becomes <strong>futile</strong>. Neville Goddard’s teachings highlight that the future isn’t something fixed or predestined that can be divined by external tools like tarot cards. Rather, it is <strong>shaped by the assumptions and beliefs</strong> we hold in the present moment.</p>
<p>The <strong>future</strong> is not something that exists separately from us, waiting to be uncovered. It is a reflection of our <strong>current state of being</strong>. The assumptions we hold about ourselves, our worth, our possibilities, and the world around us will determine what we experience in the future. The <strong>Law of Assumption</strong> teaches that <strong>we create our reality through the assumptions we live by</strong>, not by predicting or waiting for the future to reveal itself.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we turn to tarot cards for answers about the future, we’re missing the point of their deeper symbolism. Tarot cards can provide insight into our current state of consciousness and offer guidance on what assumptions we may need to change, but they cannot predict the future in the traditional sense. The future is <strong>malleable</strong> and depends entirely on the assumptions we adopt today. If we change our assumptions, we change the future.</p>
<p><strong>If I were to predict someone’s future using tarot cards</strong>, I wouldn’t focus on a specific event or outcome. Instead, I would focus on how the individual currently views themselves — their beliefs, assumptions, and mindset. This is because <strong>a person’s state of being</strong> directly influences the experiences and circumstances they will encounter in the future. The state of mind that someone holds today is the blueprint for their future. If they see themselves as successful, confident, or abundant, that is the future they will create. But if they hold onto beliefs of lack, fear, or limitation, that will shape the future they experience.</p>
<p>By understanding the symbolism in the tarot and applying the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, we can use the cards not to predict the future but to assess the current state of consciousness. This gives us the opportunity to make the necessary shifts in our assumptions and beliefs, knowing that <strong>the future is not set in stone</strong> — it is a reflection of what we assume to be true today.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard himself said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Signs always follow, they never precede.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This profound quote reminds us that <strong>our assumptions create the signs</strong> that manifest in our world. In other words, we don’t need to look for signs in the tarot or elsewhere to predict the future. Instead, we are the creators of those signs by the assumptions we hold in our imagination. The external world simply reflects our inner world, showing us the results of the assumptions we’ve been living by.</p><div class="share-dropdown">
