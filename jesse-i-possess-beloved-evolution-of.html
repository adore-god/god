<h1>Jesse: I Possess the Beloved – An Evolution of the Awakened State</h1><div class="container">
<main class="content"><article>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s metaphysical framework, Jesse—the <a href="the-father-son-symbolism-in-bible.html">father</a> of David—is far more than a historical figure. His name, meaning “I possess” or “to exist,” reveals a profound spiritual premise. Jesse symbolises the foundational act of manifestation: <i>possession</i> in <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>. He represents the vital evolutionary shift in perception where one claims their identity and internalises the “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” presence.</p><h2>Possession Precedes Manifestation</h2><p>Neville often taught that manifestation does not begin with wishing or striving—it begins with possession. To “possess” something is to enter the state of being where it is already true. Jesse embodies this possession; he is the root consciousness that holds the seed of manifestation within, the inner state that claims what is desired as already theirs.</p><p>In this symbolic lineage of consciousness:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesse</strong> = the one who possesses the beloved state within, the possessor of awakened selfhood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong> = the beloved, the awakened state, the divine identity realised and expressed.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To say, “I possess the beloved,” is to declare, “I possess the awakened self. I possess the divine imagination.”</p><h2>Jesse as the Root and Source</h2><p>Jesse’s role in Scripture is subtle yet foundational. When the prophet Samuel arrives to anoint Israel’s next king, Jesse assumes it will be one of his older sons. Yet it is <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David, the youngest, overlooked and tending sheep</a>, who is chosen. This moment symbolises how the <a href="the-first-shall-be-last-ephraim-esau.html">newest, often hidden state of consciousness</a>—the assumption of favour and greatness—arises quietly from within.</p><p>Jesse’s name echoes the divine root of all becoming, resonating with the “<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” revealed to Moses in Exodus 3:14 (“<a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">I AM THAT I AM</a>”). The Hebrew root of Jesse’s name and the word “I AM” share the same essence—existence, possession, and creative power.</p><p>Neville interprets this as the realisation that you are both the <strong>root</strong> (source) and the <strong>offspring</strong> (expression) of your divine Self, as echoed in Revelation 22:16:<br>
“I am the root and the offspring of David…”</p><p>This prophetic root symbolism appears also in Isaiah and Ezekiel, deepening Jesse’s meaning:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah 11:1</strong>: “A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ezekiel 17:22</strong>: “I will take a shoot from the very top of a cedar and plant it; I will break off a tender one from the topmost of its young twigs and plant it on a high and lofty mountain.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These <a href="rooted-in-imagination-trees-vines-and.html">images of a <strong>branch</strong> or <strong>shoot</strong></a> from Jesse’s root illustrate how new life, new consciousness, and new manifestations emerge from a deep inner source—mirroring Neville’s teaching that manifestation springs from an assumed inner state.</p><h2>The Power of Assumption in Jesse’s Line</h2><p><a href="the-father-son-symbolism-in-bible.html">Sons in the Bible</a> often represent emerging or developed states of awareness. <a href="davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David</a>, Jesse’s <a href="the-first-shall-be-last-ephraim-esau.html">youngest</a> son, symbolises the fresh, pure state of assumption—innocent, aligned, and untested. The <a href="the-symbolism-of-brothers-in-bible.html">older brothers</a> represent the dominant facts of outer reality, while the youngest son rises to fulfilment through the power of inner assumption.</p><p>Jesse, the father, holds this potential within. He represents the deeper consciousness that possesses the seed of greatness, even before it visibly manifests.</p><p>This pattern is repeated throughout Scripture with figures like <a class="noTag" href="scrolls/label-joseph-series.html">Joseph</a> and <a href="joseph-and-benjamin-symbolism-breakdown.html">Benjamin</a>—those who rise from seeming insignificance to manifest destiny because their root is in imagination and the assumption of favour.</p><h2>Scripture as Metaphor: Jesse Possesses, David Manifests</h2><p>In 1 Samuel 16, Saul—the reigning king, symbolic of the current dominant perception—sends for David:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Then said Saul to Jesse, ‘Send me your son David, which is with the sheep.’” (1 Samuel 16:11)</p>
</blockquote><p>And later:</p><blockquote>
<p>“And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, ‘Let David stand before me; for he hath found <b>favour in my sight</b>.’” (1 Samuel 16:22)</p>
</blockquote><p>Saul here represents the outer conscious mind—the established state of being—while David represents the new awakened self ready to step forward and take its place.</p><p>Yet it is Jesse who “sends forth” David. This illustrates Neville’s principle: before the awakened self can manifest outwardly, the inner consciousness must first possess it.</p><p>Jesse’s possession is the necessary inner preparation; David’s appearance is the natural outcome of that possession.</p><h2>Conclusion: From Possession to Becoming</h2><p>Jesse may seem an unassuming figure, but he embodies a pivotal spiritual truth:<br>
<strong>To possess is to become.</strong></p><p>He holds the “beloved” within before it is expressed. Likewise, your assumed state—your possession of the fulfilled desire—contains the full pattern of your divine Self.</p><p>When you embody “I and my imagination are one,” you, like Jesse, claim your creative identity. From this root, the awakened self arises, manifesting your desires naturally and effortlessly.</p><p>Stand as Jesse does—quiet, assured, possessing what you seek—and watch as the beloved (your manifested reality) emerges from within.</p>
