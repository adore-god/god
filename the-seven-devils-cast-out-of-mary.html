    <h1>Mary Magdalene: Seven Devils or Demons</h1>
    <p></p><blockquote>“This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.”— Genesis 2:23</blockquote><p>This verse is not about the origin of gender, but a profound metaphysical law: that the “<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a>” is the world we birth from within—our assumptions made flesh. She is not separate from “<a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>” (our awareness), but drawn out from him, as manifestation is drawn from consciousness. And with this lens, we reencounter <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong>, the woman from whom <strong>seven devils</strong> were cast out.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Mary Magdalene: The Transformed World</strong></h2><p>In the Gospels (Luke 8:2; Mark 16:9), Mary Magdalene is named as the one from whom seven devils were cast out. Tradition wrapped this in shame, <a href="the-many-faces-of-subconscious-women-of.html">wrongly merging</a> her with the “sinful woman” of Luke 7, painting her as a <a href="the-many-faces-of-subconscious-women-of.html">prostitute</a>. But the text doesn’t say this—and Neville Goddard’s teaching invites us to read symbolically, not morally.</p><p>Mary is <strong>the world reshaped</strong>—the “<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a>” formed from the transformation of consciousness. The devils are not evil spirits in the literal sense, but <strong>states of mind</strong>, false assumptions, occupying the womb of imagination and birthing distorted realities.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Seven Devils: The Fullness of Miscreation</strong></h2><p>In Scripture, the number <a href="the-completion-of-creation-and.html"><strong>seven</strong> denotes <strong>completeness</strong></a>. Mary’s seven devils symbolise a mind <strong>fully immersed in false identity</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> unworthy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> alone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> broken</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I AM defined by my past</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I AM unloved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I AM powerless</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I AM separate from God</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These assumptions are the distorted substance from which her "world" was made. Just as <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a> is "taken from <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a>," so our outer life is drawn from our inner self-concept. Until these inner devils are named and cast out—replaced—we cannot birth the life we desire.</p><hr/><h2><strong>The Casting Out: Replacing the Image</strong></h2><p>Neville taught, <em>“You don’t fight error. You replace it.”</em> The casting out of the devils is not a violent spiritual act—it is the <strong>shift in identity</strong>. When Mary meets <strong>Jesus</strong>—the awakened imagination—she no longer sees herself through the lens of distortion. She assumes a new truth. This is woman reborn, not through external change, but through inner re-identification.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Jesus and the Inner 'I AM'</strong></h2><p>Jesus, in Neville’s teaching, is not a historical figure alone, but the <strong>embodiment of awakened imagination</strong>—the “I AM” presence. His interaction with Mary represents a <strong>meeting of conscious identity with the truth of being</strong>. She does not merely see a man; she sees herself differently in His presence. She now reflects His image. This is Genesis 2:23 in motion: the outer world <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">(woman)</a> now testifies to a new inner <a href="genesis-126-man.html">man</a> (awareness).</p><hr/><h2><strong>Mary as the Pure Vessel: Receptive, Reflective, Restored</strong></h2><p>Just as Eve is “bone of my bones,” Mary becomes the <strong>reflection of the risen imagination</strong>. She is the first to see the resurrected Jesus. Why? Because her inner eye is clear. She is no longer creating from the distortions of the devils, but from the unity of “<a href="i-and-father-are-one-interpreted.html">I and my Father are one</a>.” This is why the "<a href="genesis-223-woman.html">woman</a>" is called forth in Genesis: <strong>to give form to what man assumes</strong>.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Genesis 2:23 and the Law of Consciousness</strong></h2><p>When Adam says, <em>“She shall be called Woman,”</em> he is naming—not another being—but a projection of his inner state. Every condition in your world, Neville taught, is <strong>your assumption made visible</strong>. Mary, as a figure, reminds us that <strong>we are constantly giving birth</strong> to our realities. What we call “woman” is not other—it is us, <strong>externalised</strong>.</p><p>Mary’s devils were cast out not by judgment, but by new identification. In the same way, your world (woman) transforms when your consciousness (man) awakens.</p><hr/><h2><strong>The Seven Nations and the Cleansed Mind</strong></h2><p>In Deuteronomy 7:1, Israel is told to drive out seven nations before entering the Promised Land. These nations represent false mental constructs—<strong>the devils of distorted belief</strong>. Like Mary, we must cleanse the subconscious womb. Only then does the new land—<strong>the new reality</strong>—open before us.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Conclusion: Becoming the Woman of the New World</strong></h2><p>Mary Magdalene, freed of devils, becomes the symbol of the <strong>regenerated Woman</strong>—consciousness that no longer bears children of fear, guilt, and separation. She is the clear vessel. She is <em>bone of the awakened man’s bones</em>—the visible world now aligned with truth.</p><p>Genesis 2:23 is not a creation myth, but a blueprint: You, the inner man, give birth to your world—your “woman”—by what you assume. And like Mary Magdalene, once the devils are gone, the world becomes a witness to resurrection.<br/>
Not of a man long ago—but of your <strong>divine imagination</strong>, now risen.</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-genesis-2-23-series.html">Genesis 2:23 Series</a> | <a href="label-numbers--seven.html">Numbers: Seven</a> | <a href="label-women-in-the-bible-series.html">Women in the Bible Series</a></p>
