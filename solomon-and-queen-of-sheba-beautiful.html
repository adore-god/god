<p></p><div><img alt="Solomon Queen Sheba Icon The Way" border="0" data-original-height="1415" data-original-width="1292" height="320" src="images/1748591576246.jpg" width="292"/></div><br>The story of the Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon is more than historical curiosity. Understood symbolically, as Neville Goddard taught, this passage reveals the mechanics of manifestation and the spiritual movement from desire to fulfilment through the Law of Assumption. <p></p><h3>Desire Approaches Fulfilment</h3><p></p><blockquote>“And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions, at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and <a href="camels-in-bible-symbol-of-faith-and-law.html">camels</a> that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.” — 2 Chronicles 9:1</blockquote><p></p><p>In Neville’s framework, every figure in Scripture represents a state of <a href="elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> or an inner process. The Queen of Sheba is not a literal monarch, but rather the embodiment of desire—the stirring within that seeks expression. Psyche-wise, <a href="genesis-223-woman.html">women</a> in the Bible personify the receptive power within the mind that gives form to the desires conceived by <i><a href="genesis-126-man.html">Man</a></i>.</p><p>She arrives with “hard questions,” symbolising the doubts, contradictions, and tensions that naturally accompany any earnest desire. She is the testing spirit, asking: Can this really work? Can imagination truly bring about results?</p><p>The <strong>“very great company”</strong> she brings with her can be interpreted as the many aspects of our own thoughts, experiences, and beliefs that accompany a desire. These all play a role in the process of manifestation, shaping the conditions under which the desire is tested and eventually realised.</p><p>The <strong>“<a href="camels-in-bible-symbol-of-faith-and-law.html">camels</a> that bare spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones”</strong> represent the tools and resources required to bring a desire into fruition. Spices symbolise the persistence and emotional fragrance of the journey—those qualities that sustain us as we move toward fulfilment. Gold, in abundance, signifies the value and intensity of the desire. The precious stones can be seen as the wisdom and insights gained along the way. Each of these elements—spices, gold, and stones—represents a different aspect of the manifestation process, from the initial longing to the ultimate fulfilment.</p><p>Finally, when the Queen comes to Solomon and <strong>“communes with him of all that was in her heart,”</strong> this is a symbolic representation of the inner dialogue that takes place when a desire is being birthed within the mind. It is not just the spoken word or the asking for what is desired, but the heartfelt communication with one's own inner state—the imagination—about the wishes, fears, and expectations that shape the manifestation.</p><h3>Nothing Hidden: Fulfilment Answers All Doubts</h3><p><strong>“Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.”</strong> — 2 Chronicles 9:2</p><p>Solomon—symbolic of the assumed end—has nothing to conceal. Neville taught that the end contains all. Once you enter the state of the wish fulfilled, all mental wrestling ceases. There is no struggle left when one knows.</p><p>The state itself answers all questions. The “how” fades, the “when” dissolves. It is done.</p><p><strong>“Be still and know that you are that which you desire to be.”</strong> — Neville Goddard</p><h3>The World Restructured Around Assumption</h3><p><strong>“And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built…”</strong> — 2 Chronicles 9:3</p><p>What does desire see? It sees the externalised form of assumption. The house, the table, the throne, the ascent—these represent a world reordered by a new state of being.</p><p>Neville was clear: your external world will always mirror your internal assumption. The Queen (desire) witnesses Solomon’s kingdom (fulfilled state) and sees the proof. Her questioning spirit collapses.</p><p><strong>“There was no more spirit in her.”</strong> — 2 Chronicles 9:4</p><p>In other words, the striving is over. Desire has been answered by entering the presence of its own fulfilment.</p><h3>Faith Born of Experience</h3><p><strong>“It was a true report which I heard in mine own land… howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it.”</strong> — 2 Chronicles 9:5-6</p><p>This is the journey of anyone who comes to Neville’s teaching. At first, the idea that imagination creates reality is intriguing—but abstract. Only when one proves it through experience does it become conviction.</p><p>The Queen’s shift from scepticism to surrender mirrors the movement from curiosity to assumption—from hoping to knowing.</p><h3>Desire Gives Itself to Fulfilment</h3><p><strong>“And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance…”</strong> — 2 Chronicles 9:9</p><p>What happens to desire when it finds its home? It pours itself into the fulfilment.</p><p>The gold represents the value and intensity of longing. The spices represent the scent of persistence—the emotional fragrance carried through the journey of waiting, yearning, and pressing forward. Nothing is wasted. The riches of desire are transmuted into the treasury of the fulfilled state.</p><h3>The World Responds to Your Assumption</h3><p><strong>“And the servants also of Huram… brought gold from Ophir…”</strong> — 2 Chronicles 9:10</p><p>Others begin to play their part, often unknowingly. As Neville said:</p><p><strong>“Everyone is yourself pushed out.”</strong> — Neville Goddard</p><p>The world begins to conform to your assumption. Even seemingly unrelated channels (Huram’s servants) deliver gold. You do not make it happen; the state itself compels expression. The Law works impersonally, but precisely.</p><h3>Final Reflection: The Path from ‘I Wish’ to ‘I Am’</h3><p>The entire episode is a spiritual drama in miniature:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Desire awakens (the Queen hears of Solomon).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resistance emerges (she tests him with questions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fulfilment silences doubt (nothing is hidden).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence is witnessed (she sees his order and beauty).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Desire yields to fulfilment (she gives her riches).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world aligns (more wealth is drawn in).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville Goddard taught that desire is only fulfilled when it is assumed—not chased, not doubted, not negotiated with. The Queen of Sheba and Solomon are not ancient figures. They are you: your own inner movement between wanting and being.</p><p><strong>“Dare to assume you are what you want to be and you will compel everyone to play their part.”</strong> — Neville Goddard</p><p class="label-links"><a href="label-animals-series.html" class="noTag">Animals Series</a> | <a href="label-bible-verse-analysis.html" class="noTag">Bible Verse Analysis</a> | <a href="label-genesis-2-23-series.html" class="noTag">Genesis 2:23 Series</a> | <a href="label-solomon-series.html" class="noTag">Solomon Series</a> | <a href="label-women-in-the-bible-series.html" class="noTag">Women in the Bible Series</a></p>
