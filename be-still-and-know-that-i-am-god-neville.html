<blockquote><p><em>“Be still, and know that <br> I AM God.”</em><br>
— Psalm 46:10</p>
<p>"..bone of my bones <br> 
and flesh of my flesh.."
<br>
— Genesis 2:23 </p>
</blockquote><p>This verse is often quoted as encouragement to prayer or quiet reflection. But when read through Neville Goddard’s teaching, it reveals something deeper: it is a direct instruction on how to realise the <a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">power of <strong>I AM</strong> within yourself.</a></p><h2>The Name of God: I AM</h2><p>When Moses asked God His name, the answer came:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I AM THAT I AM… Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.”</em><br>
— Exodus 3:14</p>
</blockquote><p>“I AM” is the divine name. It is not distant, but present—<a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">your own awareness of being</a>. Every time you say “I AM,” you are using the name of God. Psalm 46:10 is therefore a reminder to recognise this truth: that the <a href="elohim-god.html">creative power of the universe is your own consciousness</a>.</p><h2>Stillness Is Mastery</h2><p>To “be still” does not mean to sit in passivity. It means to stop reacting to appearances and silence the noise of fear, doubt, and striving. Stillness is <a href="genesis-47-sin.html">inner mastery: withdrawing from outer struggle to rest in the centre of being</a>.</p><h2>Knowing I AM</h2><p>“<b><i>Know</i></b> that I AM [IS] God” is not about acknowledging an external deity. It is an invitation to realise that the <strong><a href="exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></strong> within you—the simple awareness of existing—is the one creative power. To <em>know</em> is to accept it with certainty, not as a hope but as a fact.</p><h2>Already Done</h2><p>When you enter stillness, you are not retreating but affirming:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Be still</strong> = Withdraw from reaction and struggle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Know</strong> = Accept that imagination is reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM God</strong> = Awareness, the I AM, is the creator.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In this stillness you find the quiet confidence that what you assume in imagination is already accomplished. The outer world will mirror it in due time, but within, it is finished.</p><h2>In Summary</h2><p>Stillness is not weakness—it is creative strength. To <em>be still and know</em> is to recognise the divine name “I AM” as your own being, and to rest in its power:</p><p>“I AM is God. And because I imagine, it is done.”</p>
